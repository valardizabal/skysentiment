✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh to Perth,August 2024,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"   Money making enterprise, preying off customers with flights re-timed/cancelled (suspect consolidating passenger lists), long checkin processes, cabin baggage extras and poor meals availability. We had 4 flights with Viet Jet (Perth-HCM-HAN return) and only 1 was per initial scheduled itinerary. Not great when planning holidays end to end with international transfers. Notice always recieved by email and SMS so at least allowed decisions to be taken (at your inconvienience). If your flight is retimed by 1-5h VietJet will put you on the next flight if you front up to a ticket counter at the departing airport (no cost - but only area we saved). Cannot pre-buy more than 20kgs online nor add more kgs after booking confirmed - you have to buy at VietJet ticket desk (please fix this VietJet). Being well travelled, we bought an extra 7kgs a few days before our flights home to fit in some shopping -cost us VND2.2mil at ticket office (thought we got ahead of 20kgs check maximum and luggage dramas - so we thought). Will weigh all your personnel items ladies and combine into carry on (no more than 9kg allowed). Had 11kgs one flight with wifes handbag and had to check in a 9kg carry on bag (no choice to repack as already dispatched checked bags). Another trip to ticketing desk that cost us VND 2.8mil. We nearly missed that flight after 2.30h waiting in lines at HCM. PS. VietJet staff should keep an eye on less honest people who were leaving their carry on bags in line up or with friends and taking on board anyway without having a cabin baggage tag - at least be consistent with policies! You see multiple customers carry on 2-3 bags each (no way that 9kgs a passenger). Booked exit row all the way but lost our seat allocation on one retimed domestic flight - no refunds or explanations. My wife wanted to move from an exit row and sleep in a free row, but staff want to charge another fee per on-board seat change policy. We didnt pre order any meals, but by the time they get to selling to us in row 11, we find only hot noodles or pork bah mi available on international flights (not great when dont eat pork for a 6h flight). PS. VietJet only take cash - no cards. There is no free anything on board (incl water). With all the stress/lost holiday time and extra cost it would have been cheaper and better to go with a full service airline. CANNOT RECOMMEND."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City,August 2024,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,2,  Flew twice delayed both ways. 1 flight was cancelled with no information. Staff does not bother to inform you of any delays even though you are standing in front of them The cabin crew and ground staff are rude and incompetent. Never fly this airline!
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Busan to Nha Trang,August 2024,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"   Avoid Vietjet unless you're willing to have your trip ruined by an airline that doesn't care about its customers. Flight to Vietnam was delayed by three hours. When I looked at the departure board, I saw that all other Vietjet flights were also delayed. It seems like this is typical for the airline. Seat was broken on the plane so it reclined every time I leaned back. Flight back to Korea was even worse. Our flight was at 1am on Saturday morning, but after waiting over thirty minutes to get to the check-in desk, they told us that the flight had been changed to a smaller plane and there weren't enough seats for everyone so we couldn't get on the plane. We were then directed to an extremely callous manager who told us that all flights to Korea were fully booked for the entire weekend so we could either cancel our flight and get a refund or sit in the airport for the whole weekend hoping someone would cancel so we could take their seats. We had my four year old son with us so that option was impossible, and when I explained that to the manager he started shouting at me. In the end, we had to cancel the flight and book a flight with a different airline to another city in Korea for double the refund amount, then get a connecting flight back for our home city for an additional cost. The manager seemed very happy when I agreed to cancel and I hated to give him the satisfaction, but when your child is crying and asking why we can't go home, you'll do almost anything to get him out of that situation."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh to Da Nang,August 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," I flew with them multiple times. They delay flights often. And it’s happened again. On top of it they weigh every single piece of your luggage and charge you for everything. If you exceeded the limit — they will definitely take an advantage and will charge you money. They earn on everything : seat selection, for water. Terrible — avoid by all means! Next time I will choose another airline"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to Phu Quoc,July 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"   I have flown with VietJet four or five times now and have only praise. Once, I received an email saying that my flight had been re-scheduled by one hour - later (I received this five hours before my flight departure). Although a tiny bit inconvenient, at least they notified me. The planes, staff, prices and add-on services are absolutely excellent and offer exceptional value for money. The airline also flies to some great destinations that would normally involve two stops with the traditional airlines. I have just booked a flight from Phu Quok to Bangkok with VietJet and is currently the only airline offering this direct flight. The planes are a bit bigger than LCC's that I have used in the past. Although it may be just the time of the year, there has been ample space on the plane."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ho chi minh to Da Nang,July 2024,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"   Always delayed. I knew this already but I had to book another flight with them because no other companies had the right schedule for me. As a result, a flight scheduled at 10pm was rescheduled 3 times to 11:30, 12:35, and finally 2am. This is our flight back to Saigon, and it's happening after our flight to da Nang was rescheduled from 2:35 to 4pm. Wonderful work Vietjet Air"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh City,July 2024,1.0,4.0,1.0,,,1.0,2,no,1,"  The worst airline in Vietnam. Ticket is cheap, however, it will kill all your plans. I had a flight at 8:55PM. It is pushed back to 8:25PM. When I got to the airport in Da Nang, I got the notification that it was now delayed till 9:30PM. Could not do anything else but wait. At 9:00PM, got another notification that the flight was delayed to 10:00PM. I was at the airport for 3 hours without knowing when I could get on the plane. VietJet squeezed all the flights they had that night in one flight, which was the 10:00PM one. Also, 10:00PM was not the time the plane flied, they boarded at 10:00pm. Got off the plane and waited 40 minutes more to get my checked bag without any clear explanation for the airline nor any staff. My plan was to get to Sai Gon at 10pm, and Vietjet ruined it. It was the most horrible flight I’ve ever gone. Some may say that “it only happens a couple times”. Yea, just a couple. 8/10 of the flights are delayed. Some even got delayed overnight. I know the flight is cheap but there is always a catch. If you value money over your plan, time, and experience, go with Vietjet. Otherwise, keep away from this airline even though the price is tempting. Vietjet knows this problem, but they choose to ignore it, and Vietnam does not have strict rule on airlines, so there will be no benefit for you if they flight is delayed or cancelled. Pick wisely!"

There is no advance notice, no way to call the hotline number, and when arriving at the airport there is no flight to change. Terrible."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Da nang to Bangkok,July 2024,3.0,3.0,,,,1.0,2,no,2,"  I just encountered an issue with Vietjet Airlines at Da Nang International Airport. Despite my ticket clearly stating that I'm allowed one personal item and one carry-on (max 7kg), the agents insisted on combining both items and charging me for a checked bag. When I asked for clarification, they became dismissive and rude, refusing to explain their reasoning. Instead, they started speaking in their native language, seemingly gossiping and insulting me. I hope Vietjet can improve their customer service and ensure consistent policy enforcement."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ha Noi to Buon Ma Thuot,July 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"   The 6:15 flight departed on time and arrived 15 minutes earlier than scheduled. The check-in counter staff were very efficient and professional, providing thorough guidance through the check-in process. The flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic, assisting passengers with organizing their carry-on luggage. When a passenger felt airsick, the attendant responded promptly by preparing a vomit bag and providing assistance."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Ho Chi Minh City,July 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"   If You are going to travel with infants and kids using Vietjet you should read this review.  During our first flight from Perth to Ho Chi Minh City, we were allocated seats at the back of the plane, seat 38 with a 5 months old baby, 3 years old toddler and 7 years old kid. It was highly inconvenient (hot, noisy and shaking) , especially considering we were traveling with young children who require extra attention and care.  My infant and toddler got sick after the flight. So for our return flight I purchased front row seats, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 4C, where we would be able to sit together with my husband and attend to the needs of our children more effectively. However, upon check-in, we were informed that our seats had been reallocated further down the plane, seats 14D, 14E, 14F, and my husband was assigned seat 17C, separate from the rest of our family. We were informed that our seats had been given to business-class passengers without any further explanation or consideration. To make matters worse, she mentioned that we ""may or may not"" receive a refund. This dismissive and unsatisfactory response left us feeling angered and neglected. The lack of empathy, understanding, and professionalism displayed by your staff during this experience is deeply concerning."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phú Quốc to Hồ Chí Minh,July 2024,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,2,no,1,"   VietJet Air is infamous for their lateness and delay. All of my friends and family have warned me about Vietjet but I thought how bad can it be and they did pretty badly. For a start, there was a delay of 30 minutes and when we have finally embarked on the plane, the plane smells really bad. The seat is torn and the arm rests are old and peeled. There was rubbish on the floor when we first walked in. Overall it wasn't an enjoyable flight. "
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hi Chi Minh to Bangkok,July 2024,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"   Have flown a number of times, they are constantly late/delayed or don’t fly at all.  You talk to staff and they are too busy doing hair, sleeping or playing games on phone!! Budget airline, absolute joke."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh City to Da Nang,July 2024,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Appalling airline. We had lengthy delays both on our outbound and return. Our outbound journey was delayed from 22:10 to 01:00 which was bad enough, but our flight back was even worse. For our return journey we were only notified at 18:30 that our 20:55 flight had been delayed until 12:05, then later contacted again to be told it was rescheduled for 03:20. The explanation they gave us when boarding was bad weather in Ho Chi Minh City, which we knew to be to be lies as we have relatives there who confirmed there was no rain in the after 20:00. It seems that Vietjet don’t care about customers’ schedules and are content to delay everyone’s flights until they can fill a plane to full capacity. No wonder domestic tourism is down with service like this. I will personally never use Vietjet again and will recommend to others to find alternative airlines or train service. Being delayed by 6 hours for a 1 hour flight is unacceptable. Especially when you pay a higher fare for a peak time, then get delayed to a time which was available at a much lower price!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh,July 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Literally the most unreliable airline, every single flight we booked through Vietnam was delayed. The most irritating part is that they claim to send you a mail intimating you of delay. In some cases they do, but in most cases they do not. Please avoid flying viet jet. You won’t regret it."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Ho Chi Minh to Brisbane,July 2024,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  During my flight in business class from Vietnam to Brisbane, I suffered from food poisoning. Upon landing at Brisbane airport, I was taken to the hospital by ambulance without going through immigration and customs. I worried if I missed the flight to Cairns at 8:45 am. I was discharged from the hospital at 5:45 am. My daughter booked a room for me at the Pullman Airport Hotel, but I didn't get a chance to go. Additionally, I needed to retrieve my three suitcases from the international airport. I made multiple trips between the domestic and international airport, finally, I found the hand luggage company. They said they would arrange my suitcases get delivered to my home. But it's been for 4 days and nothing happens. I rang them twice a day and left a message, but they never call me back. I send a complaint email to Vietjet. They sent me an automated response only. Vietjet has never asked me how I was.  Don't fly with Vietjet. They are a worst airline company."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Hi Chi Min City to Vinh,June 2024,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3,yes,6,"  In mid-June, I had a round-trip flight with vietjet air I departed from Ho Chi Minh City airport and flew to Vinh Airport. Even though it is a low-cost airline, I found the flight service to be quite good, especially the flight attendants on the plane. They communicated and served meals on my flight quite friendly and attentive, just There is one thing that makes me not very satisfied, that is the checked baggage delivery service is not very good, my suitcase was quite scratched during transportation, perhaps this problem lies in the service of the airline. At the airport, it is advised that you wrap your luggage carefully if you have to check it in."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Hà Nội to Sài Gòn,June 2024,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,no,3,"  We fly Vietjet 4 times in the last 10 days. 2 times delay. That make it 50% delay. For today, original time is 13:50. New time is 17:50 This is unacceptable for any airline. I will not book another flight with this airline."
Not Verified ,A333,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Delhi to Hanoi,June 2024,1.0,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,3,"   Booking: easy through web site. Checkin ok. However, I had selected priority checking and when in the checkin queue, I asked to one Vietjet assistance for the priority check, he instructed to follow the same queue as the others. When checking in, other assistance realized that I should pass through other queue. During checking I asked for an upgrade. I was granted with premium economy. The counter girls issue the new seat and told I had to pay. Usually is the opposite, you are advised about the price before issue the new boarding pass. Price was 1800INR, seems ok so I proceed. No baggage checked.  The premium seat is the same as an eco, there is no difference, width all the same. Seat distribution is 9 seat abreast per row. Ie, high density for an A333. I also realized the business was empty, when asked the assistance, they declared it was empty by purpose and not allowed to upgrade to business.  Service low cost. There are not even pillow for the passenger despite it was a night flight.  No IFE or wifi, or USB charging point. I have no intention to fly again in Vietjet except is no other option is available or is much price convenient. Positive was the times that were met."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Hochiminh to Da Nang,June 2024,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  The worst ever. Just keep changing the time and delaying, even 3 or 4 time changes for 1 flight. Also air crew were impolite and rude to me  Nothing good to say about this airline. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh city to Quy Nhon city,June 2024,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I had a flight from Ho Chi Minh to Quy Nhon with Vietjet Air The flight was on time, the check-in counter staff was very professional and I was given a leg-wide seat at no extra charge. In flight, cabin crew was friendly and enthusiastic. I had a very good experience for this flight."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh to Da Nang,June 2024,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Extremely bad attitude when answering customer's questions and dealing with customer's problems. They don't have the necessary skills, especially the counter staff and ground service staff, to take care of customers. They lack manners and possess poor attitudes in their work, with no customer's customer-centric thinking approach, only themselves. They are Vietnamese airlines that serve both Vietnamese and foreign customers but their operations are only as if their customers are all Vietnamese in terms of flight booking, when asking for the customer's name this process looks like they are trying to scam the customer to get more money by framing the customer fall into their traps of ""it's your fault"". The way the customer care staff handles the customer's inquiries is also extremely rude they act as if they were the customer's god or superior with no respect or sympathy. This makes me as a customer along with many others feel bad and as if they had made a huge mistake to their god or boss. Besides, when booking the flight for 2 people, they give the option of selecting 2 checked baggage which makes no sense when there are 2 tickets for 2 people on the same flight at the same time but with only one checked baggage, it was only one option for 1 checked baggage (20kg) for 2 people which is ridiculous when I was not able to select other options and they tried to put me in a situation that I had to buy more checked baggage at the check-in which cost enormously higher than if it was booked on the website right at the first time."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to Seoul,June 2024,2.0,4.0,1.0,,,3.0,3,no,4," Although the price i paid initially was very good. I thought it was ridiculous when I wanted a sip of water on a 4:20 flight, they offered water for US$2 (from a Vietnamese brand I bought for a 10x lower price on the 0.2 US$ market for same brand) remembering that no meal or snack is offered included in the ticket, but you can buy cup noodles for US$ 10. I thought it would be a big water bottle like the one on the counter trolley, but they gave me a mini bottle of water. I asked for my money back and continued with a dry throat for the last 2 hours of the flight.  They already charge carry on with size more then 23cmx36cm or more than 7kg for international flights. So i paid US$30. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Can Tho to Danang,May 2024,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,5.0,5,yes,8,"  At Can Tho Airport check-in opens two hours before your flight's departure. Both departure and arrival times adhered to the schedule, ensuring a smooth travel experience. VietJet offered a very competitive fare of 70 EUR for your one-way ticket. This attractive price even included a generous 30kg baggage allowance, eliminating the need for additional fees. While meals onboard aren't included in the base fare, VietJet offers an à la carte menu. This allows you to choose and pay for the food and beverages that suit your preferences and dietary needs."

Now I’m flying back from Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh with same round trip ticket charge 1,000,000 VND just for the name. Problem is I was allowed to fly but coming back to Ho Chi Minh ? I have to pay. Worst counter staff but flight attendants are okay.  They even want you to check in your personal bag that weights less than 7kg with laptops. Spend more money on a better airline to decrease travel stress."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Bali,May 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1, Pathetic Service. Air-conditioning was not working for almost 1 hour after boarding the plane during the night at 3 PM. Flight delay by 2 hours. Baggage missed and came after 2 days. You need to pay $5 for 200 ml of water. Water is basic need and it should be free. Cheap mentality to sell water in flight.

Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to Siem Reap,May 2024,3.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"   We reached Hanoi airport on 10th May to realize that our flight with Cambodia Angkor Air was cancelled. So, we had to book tickets Hanoi to Siem Reap. We approached the ticket counter for VietJet in Hanoi airport. They had a flight out of Hanoi at 16.50 to Siem Reap. We requested for 4 tickets (family). They said they had tickets, and it would cost us 77,44,000 VND. We said we are ok with the price and asked her to issue the tickets. Then she told us that they will issue the ticket if we can show her 2000USD in cash. I asked is this the requirement of Cambodia and she said no it is VietJet air policy. I asked her to show me in writing which she could not. Then we were forced to withdraw 2000USD worth of cash from ATM machines in the airport. I had to move money into multiple bank accounts due to the limit of ATM withdrawals. This whole process took us more than 1 hour. I lost a lot of money due to higher per transaction charges in the airport and also conversion fees lower per INR in the airport. After we reached back at the counter for the ticket the prices were now changed to 80,14,000 VND. When we questioned that how come the charges have changed, she said the extra baggage cost is higher now. The funny part is not one VietJet colleague even asked us currency. "

Like the other customers reviews, flight canceled and delayed last minute (24h ago), no compensation, no upgrade, customer service support totally useless. Can’t get a refund if you don’t call them in the 24h following the issue. A scam and a shame for this company. If you don’t want to pay extra fees/lose money, if you have business meetings, if you planned something or booked a hotel, do not choose VietJet Air."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Hai Phong to Ho Chi Minh City,May 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  After the first time flying SkyBoss, I switched to flying this class because it was so great.  Since flying Vietjet's SkyBoss class, my flights are more comfortable, I can rest and work at the same time, check in at the priority counter, and have my own dining room and waiting room. Luggage is tagged with priority for early pick-up upon landing. Security scans priority, takes about 2-3 minutes to complete. I flew on a holiday so queuing and crowding were my concerns, but SkyBoss class resolved and optimized everything. All procedures were quick, and throughout the flight, the flight attendants were very considerate and thoughtful. Very pleased. Sau lần đầu bay SkyBoss là mình chuyển qua chỉ bay hạng này vì quá tuyệt vời, vì mình phải đi công tác thường xuyên nên với việc bay liên tục như vậy khá mất sức, từ sau khi bay hạng SkyBoss của Vietjet thì những chuyến bay của mình thoải mái hơn, vừa nghỉ ngơi vừa có thể làm việc, làm thủ tục ở quầy ưu tiên, có phòng ăn phòng chờ riêng. Hành lý thì cũng được gắn thẻ ưu tiên để nhận sớm khi hạ cánh. An ninh soi chiếu ưu tiên riêng, tầm 2-3 phút rẹt rẹt cái xong. Mình bay ngay ngày Lễ nên việc xếp hàng, đông đúc là điều khiến mình quan ngại nhưng hạng SkyBoss đã giải quyết, tối ưu được hết. Mọi thủ tục nhanh chóng, suốt chuyến bay thì các bạn tiếp viên rất ân cần chu đáo. Rất hài lòng"

I can only recommend not to choose this airline and book someone else (e.g. AirAsia), even though you have to pay few Dollars more."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DaNang to Hanoi,March 2024,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"   I booked three separate flights with this airline. One flight was cancelled by the airline and I am still waiting for compensation. The second was rescheduled by the airline who refused to cancel or refund my original booking because it was made through a third party. The third was possibly the worst flight I have ever experienced. VietJet are a very poor airline with no customer service and no ability to get satisfaction. They hide behind a raft of regulations and stipulations that are impossible to argue with if you don't read Vietnamese. There is no inflight service, cabin crew were totally ineffectual to badly mannered passengers. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dalat to Danang,December 2023,,,,,,2.0,1,no,1,"  VietJet Air  does not follow international practices. Beware if you are using their services. They have a track record of cancelling and delaying flight. If they cancel your flights, your money is surely gone.  Flight was cancelled by airline, total of 4 tickets was cancelled.  The Airline should have refunded the cancelled amount back to the person who used his/her credit card to book the tickets. Instead, they credited the amount back to the 4 persons who name was indicated on the tickets in airline credits (including 2 minors who could never fly by themselves) and refuses any transfers or credit card refunds. And they don't allow transfer of credits back to the payer of the tickets. Credits must be used up within a year, otherwise it will be forfeited. Airline hides behind terms and conditions on the website and refuses to budge Never again will we give this airline business."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City,March 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Terrible flight experience. Took an 8.5 hour flight from Sydney  to Ho Chi Minh City and apparently we had to order food on the plane before hand. We didn't know that so we didn't get a meal or a drink. We could buy meals in the plane separately but they only accepted cash. No credit card (never experienced that before on a flight). As we were only on a 3 hour transit in Sydney we didn't have cash. The cabin crew did not help at all. They basically mentioned that this was our problem. For more than 8,5 hours we didn't eat or drink.  There was also no inflight entertainment. The toilets were dirty and no soap to wash hands. Never ever flying with this company again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ha Noi to Da Nang,February 2024,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Bought 2 tickets from this airline, one domestic from Ha Noi to Dan Nang and another international from Da Nang to Hong Kong. Hong Kong flight got cancelled and they moved us onto a flight 2 days later 10 days before we were to fly. Rang all the Vietnam office numbers and only the Da Nang office picked up despite saying they were open. Da Nang office confirmed they had cancelled all flights for the 2 days, our original date was 5th March and the following day 6th March, we can either fly on the 4th or 7th no other option, but no compensation on our already paid accommodation and tour if we fly out on the 4th or anything about putting us in a hotel for the 2 extra nights we have to stay (not to mention our already paid hotel in Hong Kong) They also confirmed the other offices won't pick up non-local calls - why bother to have it listed for all travellers with international code? We ended up giving up on VeitJet and bought another ticket to go to HK on the 5th of March. We were told we can request a credit if the changed flight was not suitable - but the credit cannot be used to upgrade our other flight and can only be used for the same route - why would I want to travel with VietJet again? 2nd ticket was domestic from Ha Noi to Da Nang - after having trouble checking in, had to use 4 device as it kept saying system error cannot load. we checked in at 10pm for our 10.30am flight - got an email at 3.30am local time to say our flight have been changed/delayed until 12.30pm - who checked emails at 3.30am after everyone has checked in?? Airport baggage drop off had a long line where only 3 counters was open (2 for baggage and 1 for check in but they had another 3 staff just sitting at the 4th and 5th counter chatting (do they get paid just to chat) When I was only 3rd to the counter the lady sudden put up a counter close sign - had to move the the 1st counter, only for it to reopen 5 secs later (she was just done with her sift - could have just left the counter open and swapped staff) Had a local resident jumping the queue speaking their native language with 10 ID cards, must have been a group or tour thing and the counter was about to serve them if I didn't loudly question why do they get to jump the queue when we've been waiting for 40mins - she had no choice but to ask the local resident to line up. After all that, and getting through customs we were asked to board at 12.10pm for our 12.35pm flight, 12pm we were all lined up at the gate but the gate with staff still wouldn't allow us to board until 12.40pm. Did not get seated until 12.55pm and the plane finally took off at 1.20pm Crew and staff are mediocre at best but flight is a complete joke, scam and not worth the ""savings"""

To change the flight you need the original phone number on the ticket. But then the international phone number can not call to vietjet hotline number. And Yet the help line agency will not mention it ( that your oversea phone number can not go through) until you did, after that I called back the help line then they admited it. Then your reference flight number and your ID is not good enough. They acted like they help you by giving many solutions but they know they will not work. When you buying ticket they will not say you must buy weight for your checked bag online is much cheaper at the checking counter, which is approximately about 650$ for 28Kg. It is ridiculous. "

The Vietjet people like to call it a low cost carrier but in honesty it is just a cheap airline that does not care about what passengers think of them. I think they are a profit based/oriented company and customer satisfaction is of no significance to them, based on my calculations they make more money than some of the larger carriers when you compare the ticket cost and in flight services they provide. An 8.5 hour flight plane does not have in flight entertainment system, no food or snacks unless you are willing to pay like $3 for a small bottle of water. Have very low expectations if you decide to fly with this airline or you will definitely be disappointed."

They would close counters with the huge crowds trying to make their flights. I was very surprised to learn that they do not provide free water or snacks on a 5 hour flight. Several of the stewardesses knew very little English. Most of the flight were Westerners. The seat spacing was very cramped. Thankfully, few people tilted their seats back because I would have had less than a foot between my face and the seat in front of me. It was the only direct flight from Hanoi to Bali, but I would rather spend more money and have a layover"

Actually, I was gasping for air and had to squeeze out of the bus to wait for the next one which was nearly as packed. Second, the seats on the plane were narrow and extremely uncomfortable (the flight lasted 5 hours 10 min), with no individual entertainment system. Everything, even water, was for sale. Third - attention! The toilets did not work! When I tried to use the lavatory, the toilet was full. I addressed a flight attendant about it (she was sitting nearby checking her phone), and received the reply that the toilets were ""inoperable"" and they (the crew) ""had no choice."" I though it was the passengers who had no choice. I used the lavatory anyway, and you can imagine how pleasant it was. Finally, the huge baggage sticker was glued to my suitcase in such a way that I had to scrub it off, and there are still traces of it on my suitcase. How can such an airline still keep flying?"

Ground staff super rude, they charged me extra for my guitar when arrived to the boarding gate and left me no choice than pay. Did not call a manager when I asked to talk to one, and threatened to call the police because I wanted to recorded the interaction, I was being polite throughout the whole interaction. Flights were delayed and staff was generally horrible, also the flight was very bumpy and not fluid. They charge extra for water and coffee on flight.

I was told I could just pay when I check-in. I'll admit, I was pretty nervous about that. It seemed way too last minute. Sure enough, when I went to check-in there was an issue. However, the way the staff worked to resolve the problem was heart warming. I saw at least 5 different people working on a solution for me. And there were more behind the scenes because there were phone calls and messages being made. It was obvious how seriously they took getting me home. I would definitely fly with VietJet again."

They changed the flight schedule with no previous advice, after that they were still late on their new schedule, but you can not complain or say anything to them. The authorities don’t care about passengers. I would never recommend this company to anyone. Better if you can pay a little bit more and use other flight company, inside Vietnam, Vietnam Airlines. If you don't want to be cheated, stressed or angry, do not buy tickets with VietJet."

First we have to undergo terrible mental agony in requesting for wheel chair but at last after waiting for an hour got two wheel chairs. One of the passengers is completely disabled. She was left at the gate from where she had to step down around 20 steps which she cannot, the fellow passengers lifted her in their arms and let her get into the bus. All the airline staff were just watching and did not take any initiative to help. What a pity to the airline. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Pnomh Phen,January 2024,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1, They have a hidden policy where your carry-on and personal item combined weight can only be 7kg and if your over its 1500B that and you have to check one. One laptop a pair of shoes and a book was exactly 7kg. So you are pretty much forced to check a bag on their flights. What a terrible policy that's clearly ment to force customers into paying for baggage charges. Went on 2 different airlines before catching this garbage one and they are the only ones with this extremely low weight bag policy. AVOID at all cost. Even US discount lines end up being cheaper when including this scam fee. No wonder why they have an exceedingly high one star review level.

To start of my journey, the ground staff at the check-in counter was really rude. She took out her temper on me from her interaction with the previous customer. It seemed from the attitude of the ground staff that they only cared about their Skyboss customers and that they were doing us a favour by checking us in. The flight seats were really cramped even for a petite person like myself. For the first leg of the journey, the cabin crew barely spoke or understood English. I was only given two 500 ml water bottles for the entire 8hr of the flight. I wasn't also served the extra meal that I had paid and pre-booked. For the second part of the journey, I was quite dehydrated and asked for a glass of water from the cabin crew. She flatly ordered me to go back to my seat and happily chatted away with her colleague. I got the requested glass, albeit only half-filled approximately 15 minutes later. They also refused to serve water to my co-passengers mentioning that they didn't have enough water on board for everyone (even to buy) and only prioritised the business class passengers. There was a huge quarrel on board due to the same issue with the cabin crew even yelling at the passengers. The toilets were totally clogged and dirty. I would definitely recommend staying away from this airline. Would have given negative points if that was possible."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Phuket,January 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Vietjet air is the worst airline I have ever flown. I paid for my flight several months in advance with priceline.com, for around 60$ USD per seat, and there was 2 checked bags and 1 carry on included. When I went to the counter to check my bags, they had changed my flight number and time and said they had no record of baggage fees included, so they charged me 257$ USD. They then proceeded to bounce me around from line to line because their employees are beyond incompetent. They kept me waiting, knowing full well that I still thought I was on the original flight that was about to leave in 15 min by the time I finished bouncing around and paying my baggage fees. Not one of the employees I talked to ever mentioned my flight was changed to almost 2 hours later. I would highly suggest that no one books a flight on Vietjet air. You may think you are getting a deal booking with them, but as I mentioned, they will try to scam you. I am also going to complain to priceline.com, but I am sure this is not their fault and the fault lies purely with Vietjet air."

I showed up on time but the steward showed me the wrong way, we ended up being stuck in the immigration and were late for the flights.

On that particular day, the lines for check-in, customs, and security were very long. When I arrived at the gate, the lady yelled at me and was VERY rude. She shouted at me to hurry up. I informed her about the long lines and in response, she said I should have came earlier. I requested that she stop yelling at me as I was already very stressed from getting through all the lines. I was appalled by her attitude and lack of kindness. Is this the kind of customer service that you provide to your customers? It's rare to experience such horrible customer service by an airline."

I only had a small violin case to carry on. The agent for Thai Viet Jet told me I couldn't board with my violin case. Even after I told him that it was a very expensive instrument, and very delicate. And that there was no way I'd every check in my valuable violin under the plane with the other luggage. He told me I could pay an extra 5,500 baht for an extra seat for my violin, even though I paid just 3,000 originally for the round trip ticket. Behind me in line, were other passengers putting carry on suitcases and knapsacks that were bigger than my violin case. For him, that was no problem. It was obvious that the airline just wanted to scam me for more money. Of course, my violin took up no space in the overheard bin. I refused to pay. I will never fly Thai VietJet again. "

I arrived at the airport very early (two hours ahead), and the customer service representative asked if I would like to pay an additional 2,500,000.00 VND for a more spacious seat. I agreed, and the person at the check-in counter weighed my luggage, which was 8.3kg, and gave me the tag for my hand luggage. However, when I reached the departure gate, two ladies noticed I was Malaysian and insisted on weighing my bags again, demanding an additional 3,000,000.00 VND. I was shocked by their behaviour, especially since this was only 10 minutes before the flight was scheduled to depart. I had to throw away two packages of coffee and shirts, and one of the ladies continued to insist, speaking loudly and rudely.  I couldn't understand why they singled me out when there were so many other customers present. If my luggage had been over 10kg, I would have understood being asked to pay the fees. The most disappointing part was that they took my flight tickets and didn't return to me until just before boarding, when she willing to give me, just threw it them back at me (with impoliteness). This level of service was completely unacceptable. I suggest that they at least learn English so they can communicate politely without needing to raise their voices towards oversea customers. For me, unfortunately, I think this behaviour is acceptable and unbelievable."

We understand why other reviews are mostly negative and we think they're valid. The fact that we're not too bothered with these mostly were our personal expectations. However, I want to warn other passengers that if your itinerary requires a stop over and you have checked bags, do not fly vietjet. Apparently, VietJet Air requires its passengers to get the luggage at every stop, then get back to the counter to check in, then go through the security process all over again. VietJet Air ticket agent confirmed that all passengers must go through this cumbersome, time consuming process at stopovers.  I read everything thoroughly before committing to my purchase, especially when flying. VietJet Air did not indicate that the checked bags must go through above mentioned process. Hence, I purchased their tickets. We'll keep this in mind and will never fly VietJet Air if we must transfer with checked bags."

They provided me no solutions and were completely unapologetic and extremely rude. After asking what could be done for me to get on the flight they told me I have to buy another ticket. Mind you this was 5788 Thai baht per ticket and now I had to pay the same amount again along with my return ticket because I didn’t want to have the same issues again. I had flown from Phuket to Bangkok with the same details through AirAsia and they had no issues whatsoever.

No compensation at all and just said contact complaints. The flights was showing as going ahead that same day even though they said they had cancelled and informed me a month before. Absolute joke. If you have a really flexible schedule and aren’t bothered and looking for cheap flights maybe it’s worth a punt, but otherwise I’d avoid at all costs. No idea how they are even running.

We had paid for the window seat but the new assigned seat was not window. The executive didn't know English so we had a hard time understanding the situation. We didn't want to miss the flight so we went in with the new assigned seat. Once we entered the flight we came to know that the seat that they mentioned was broken was actually the seat for cabin crew.

Other airlines made some option to rectify this. But Vietjet asked us to buy a new ticket. How can they be so rude. Couldn't they make an exception. No discount also. Please do not travel in this airline who do not know how to deal with customers. We even accepted that it was our mistake and to make some exception. Still they were so stern.

But I had a very bad experience with the airport staff of VietJet Air during Ahmedabad check-in. Not only me, a student and a woman also felt bad. So we decided not to use VietJet Air from now on and to tell other people about our bad experience so that other passengers don't have a bad experience. Talking about the bad experience I had, my bag was 1 kg more than the airlines rule. Staff had told to lose this extra weight. I did it. This time I had 4 books in my hands. Out of which 2 books were written by me and 2 books were to read in flight. Its weight was 500 grams. Staff told to me, you cannot take these books on the flight. We will not allow you to take these books on the flight. You have gained 50 kg. I argued that 500 grams is the weight. There are books. I spoke to the leader of the staff. They even spoke to me in foul language with angry insults. The woman standing there saw this. She came to me and said to me: Sir, you are a writer. I know you. Bring your books, I will take them. I am underweight. The airline employee who was the leader got angry after hearing this. He angrily spoke to woman that you cannot carry other people's weight. Woman said that I know him. But the employee continued his speech and insulted the woman. A student standing far away saw this. He told me that I had also been treated like this and asked me to weigh the laptop too. Also, since I have a deluxe ticket, I get priority in check in as per rules. Staff had also refused priority check-in. Refusing to allow a writer to carry books weighing 500 grams. Talking to a woman was insulting in anger. Passengers don't like that. If the employees of VietJet Airline are going to behave as if the passengers are being insulted, then why should the passengers travel with these airlines. Yes, the flight from Vietnam to Melbourne was a good experience."

Crew did not allow me to board the flight because in boarding pass my name was “Veronica Bakshi” and in my passport it was “Veronica”. Thing is security cleared everything and while boarding the flight near gate, crew stopped me. I explained them that Bakshi is the surname after my marriage and my passport is before marriage that is why I don't have last name in that. I showed them my marriage certificate also. If this name mismatch is such a big issue then why did security allowed me to enter and why did not stop me at check-in point. With this minor mistake they did not allow me to board the flight and I had my hotel booking in Phuket which all wasted. I had to book another flight at higher rate for the next morning. They did not even gave me some concession. On 23rd October 2023, I was having the same airline flight from Phuket to Bangkok and the crew allowed me to board the flight with the same boarding pass and passport name mismatch. They just simply cut my last name with a pen on the boarding pass and allowed me to board the flight. When it was not such a big issue then why did your crew at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport stop me? Unnecessarily I had to pay for another flight and had to wait for 12 hours at the airport. And the crew was so unsupportive and so rude. There were two girls on duty near the gate on the night of 20th October 2023. Both of them were not ready to listen to my case. I was having my hotel booking as well for that night which was all wasted because of your crew. Even the customer care service is so bad for this airline. I kept on calling for two days to modify my name for the return flight. First they told me that they can help me with the change of name for an additional fee of 290 THB. Then after sometime they said that we can't help and I have to buy a new ticket. Luckily, I did not buy a new ticket and went with the same ticket and I was able to make it through. It was my hard earned money, why would I waste my money on such a stupid thing which is like a matter of a few seconds for your airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Chiang Mai,October 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Imagine you’ve just completed a 26 hour travel day without any issues and finally arrived in Bangkok. You’re only a short one hour flight from your final destination! So exciting! But unfortunately for you, VietJet Air is the only option for your next flight, and they are about to ruin your entire day. It’s 6:45pm and the next flight to Chiang Mai is at 9:30pm. You go to the counter to purchase your ticket. They tell you that even though there are 24 empty VietJet counters occupied by staff, they will not help you purchase a ticket, you have to purchase it online. So you attempt to do so, only to find that their abhorrent website will not allow you to make the purchase. It is now 6:50pm (this is important), you go back to the counter for help only for the staff to now inform you that you must be “within 3 hours” to purchase online. No one bothered to tell you this earlier and even though you are 2 hours and 40 mins early for the flight and could be at the gate in 20 mins, the staff REFUSES to give you a ticket even though there are clearly seats still available. So even though you are a 55 min flight from your destination, you now have to get a cab to a hotel and stay the night in Bangkok all because of the horrendous and ridiculous antics of this garbage airline. The next morning, you head to the airport very early because you know this airline is awful and likely to cause you even more trouble. You arrive at the counter at 9:30am for your flight that boards at 11:55am. Only for the staff to tell you that now “you’re too early”. You’re either too late or too early for this stupid airline apparently. They tell you to come back at 10:30am. At 10:30am you return to the counter, check your bags, and then the staff member says “your gate is very far away, you need to hurry because your flight boards in one hour”. The staff turned me away, made me wait an hour and then told me that I should hurry because I’m running out of time and my gate is very far! This is the worst airline I have ever experienced. I have 3 million social media followers and will be certain to deter them from ever using this airline and it will be the absolute last time I ever have anything to do with this airline ever again. I would rather pay double that ever see anyone that works at this airline ever again. Also, of course they airline has the worst onboard accommodations as well. I’m only 5’4” and my knees touch the seat in front of me."

But surprisingly it was right on times for my flights to and fro between Ho Chi Minh and Da Lat. I did encounter some problem when I booked the flight through the VietJet Air website. It is not user friendly. When I completed the booking and paid, I don’t receive the Itinerary and the booking had been cancelled at the back end. Fortunately the staff of VietJet Air Singapore was very helpful and assisted me to make a claim for a refund and it was refunded less than 30 days."

Upon arriving at Ho Chi Minh City airport, we encountered the epitome of rudeness and unhelpfulness from their staff. To add insult to injury, one of their own employees directed us to stand in the wrong line, causing us to miss our flight. When the mistake was finally identified, we were told that the counter had closed, and we were left high and dry. Not only did Vietjet Airlines fail in their basic duty to provide accurate information and assistance to passengers, but they also had the audacity to charge us for new flights the next day. It's astounding that they had the nerve to profit from their own employees' errors and lack of professionalism. This airline's lack of accountability, customer service, and basic decency is absolutely appalling. I wouldn't recommend Vietjet Airlines to my worst enemy."

I'm writing this review before I even fly, although at this point I won't even be flying with VietJet anymore. Booked a flight from Singapore to Da Lat via Ho Chi Minh with VietJet last month and all seemed fine at first. We would leave Singapore, have around 2-3 hours to transit in Ho Chi Minh, before taking a domestic flight over to Da Lat. Both flights were operated by VietJet. Suddenly, VietJet informs me that they have shifted me to another flight from Singapore to Ho Chi Minh. Only thing is, this flight is 3h 50min later, meaning that I will miss my connecting flight to Da Lat. Furthermore, VietJet doesn't operate any flights from Ho Chi Minh to Da Lat after my new arrival time. They shifted me to another flight without warning, where my connecting flight now leaves before I even arrive, and would have left me stranded at Ho Chi Minh. Conveniently, their refund policy only allows for changes in timing of 4h and above. It is such a coincidence that I got shifted to a flight just under the minimum period before a refund is allowed. Reaching out their customer service was also pointless, as I just got given excuses about company policy and can only address support tickets from the same email address. Staff did not even attempt to help although the problems arose from their end. 100% will never consider flying with VietJet in the future. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Denpasar via Ho Chi Minh,October 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,2," VietJet and Ho Chi Minh airport is the worst place known to mankind to visit. Due to my last minute plans I had to book this flight, however it was more of a local bus journey and Ho Chi Minh Airport is more of a makeshift local store with no wifi or decent restroom facilities. We asked for inflight standard meal to be included at whatever price needed, we were told we need to book that 3 weeks in advance, how am I supposed to do that if I booked my tickets one week before the flight. I can provide email replies from the flight support. If you want to protect your mental peace travel via some other airline and avoid distress and rude airport staff behavior. Airport staff treats foreigners as untouchables and no one is willing to help. Overall disgusting experience! I hope this helps you avoid similar experience. Have a nice day!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi,October 2023,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My recent experience with this airline was incredibly disappointing, and I strongly discourage choosing them for your travels. Delays and rescheduled flights marred my entire journey, leaving me frustrated and inconvenienced. For instance, my recent arrival in Tokyo, scheduled for 1 AM, was significantly delayed, and I didn't collect my rain-soaked luggage until 3 AM, highlighting a lack of care for passengers' belongings. If you have connecting flights or time-sensitive plans, I caution against booking with this airline due to their chronic delays and disruptions. Additionally, I observed minimal oversight regarding carry-on luggage on multiple flights, raising concerns about safety and fairness. In conclusion, investing a bit more in a more reliable airline that values punctuality and passenger satisfaction is a wise choice. This airline's numerous delays, negligence towards passengers' belongings, and lax enforcement of carry-on rules make it one to avoid at all costs, ensuring a more peaceful and enjoyable travel experience elsewhere.   Todos vuelos los retrazaron, o me cambiaron el pasaje más tarde o el avión despegó tarde. De hecho, acabo de bajar en tokio donde llegabamos a las 1AM y donde llegamos mucho más tarde, recién ahora a las 3AM salí con mi maleta, que por cierto está completamente mojada por la lluvia. Ningún cuidado. Yo recomendaría firmemente no tomar ningún vuelo con ellos que dependa para tomar un vuelo siguiente, porque van seguramente lo van a perder. No tuve problema con el sobrepeso, porque pagué siempre por bodega para ahorra el dolor de cabeza, aunque llevaba unos pocos kilos de más en mi bolso de mano. Eso sí, no vi a nadie revisando en dos vuelos Hanoi - Ho Chi Minh; Ho Chi Minh - Tokio. Gastar un poquito más y se van seguros. "

There was no mention of this when booking the ticket. I explained, until I was exasperated, that I was transiting in Mumbai with a connecting flight onto Paris within 4 hours and the Indian authorities did not require a visa for this. Mumbai has a transit area for onward flights, both Vietjet and Air France use terminal 2 so there is simply no need to leave the transit area. None of this was of any interest to Vietjet who refused to let me board as I didn’t have a visa for India. I missed my connecting flight Mumbai to Paris and my Paris to London flight. I was not the only traveller subjected to arbitrary ruling on this on this day."

The airport check in staff were rude, uncooperative, and misleading. No greeting when I approached the desk. No eye contact. But there was a lot of hostility and laissez-faire nonsense. I am British but live in Hong Kong. The staff member didn't understand that residency in Hong Kong means a Hong Kong Identity Card is proof enough to travel. Then, my carry on case was weighed and was .9 over weight, and I was told a fee was payable. After I had paid this, I was told that the case was too heavy to carry on to the plane. It would, as such, have to travel in the hold. Absurd. This added forty minutes to my wait time at Hong Kong Airport. As for the flight: it left late, arrived late, the staff were incompetent, the refreshments were poor, and then landing was woeful. Overall, a terrible airline and an awful flying experience.

No water available near the gate, poor communication skills from onboard airline staff, unable to book food online even more than a week before the flight (I took ticket earlier and thought I can book food closer to date). Unable to buy food as there was only one meal available with no options and the flight attendants were hesitant to take Australian dollar and preferred for Vietnamese currency enroute to Melbourne. We even tried to book food while checking in and we were advised to buy food onboard. My 6 year old daughter was hungry and thirsty and we did not have any options available. Since this is a Melbourne bound flight, no water is allowed from the gate, causing an absolute chaos. I will refrain using VietJet again"

I showed them on my ticket. He said it’s depend on me I wanna leave my personal bag with them or I need to pay $75 AU to carry it. He was very rude.  He was saying rudely he does not care what’s written on ticket. I have to pay for that personal bag to carry. I paid $75. I don’t understand why it’s written on ticket? Why they allow in first place to carry? They was asking people to pay money whoever have personal bag or leave with them. It’s disgusting. They are asking money on the stay for those things which are already confirmed on ticket. I will never recommend to my any friend or family member to go with this airline.

As we both have 2 small overweight cabin luggage he said we need to pay 2 x 735000 VND. This girl kept saying that there was only 1 minute left before the plane took off, and we couldn't help but pay the money.  The funny thing is, we have passed all baggage checks from the start until we can queue at the boarding line, meaning there is no problem with excess baggage weight. Our luggage has been sealed with their airline sticker which means we have the right to board the plane. When the airline staff weighed our luggage, he asked us to put our purchased items in the terminal, in the shop which is located after immigration and security check and after combining these groceries with our small cabin baggage, the weight will exceed the maximum weight for small cabin baggage."

So I decided to change the route from Hainphong to Da Nang using their ""credit shell"" which didn't work. The service customer at phone didn't help me to solve the problem telling me to pay with credit card and then asking the refund. I did it because I had a two nights booked in Hue and there were just 4 seats available. The day before I discover my first flight has been cancelled (from Hanoi to Hue) and my new flight from Haiphong to Da Nang has been delayed about 2 hours, so I had also to check if the driver would be available at 22.

When I contacted the company, they disregarded all my documentation and said they wouldn’t help me because the delayed flight was less than 2 hrs (the ticket counter said less than 1 hr).

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,HCMC to Danang,July 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," This airline is complete trash and you should avoid if at all possible. It is notorious for its delays in the last few years, and anyone who travels somewhat regularly in Vietnam knows to avoid them. It's really too bad the black eye the burgeoning tourism industry in Vietnam is suffering due to this horrible airline. At best, they are completely incompetent, and at worst, they are deliberately listing multiple routes only to ""delay"" the more expensive morning routes and consolidate into the afternoon ones. I'm writing this so that we vote with our money, since no redress request or lawsuit would ever reach this airline's owner, of the country's most powerful and influential people. This is what happened to us, in what is a probably all too familiar story (delayed total 5 hours, 2 gate changes, on runway for 1.5 hours & all this for a 1-hour flight): - bought a more expensive morning flight with our 2 kids to fly out to Danang and make the most of our hotel stay and at the same time I could still get nearly a full day of Zoom meetings in - airline advised us get to airport 3 hours early - we get an email (no SMS, no call, no other forms of communication) 2.5 hours before take-off that the flight is delayed 2 hours - official policy for delays is to provide drinks if under 3 hours, but with our young kids it wasn't going to cut it so we paid for lounge access - while waiting in the lounge, we see on the screen that our flight has changed gates. It's right next to the original one so no big deal - 10 minutes before the supposed take-off, we get another announcement that the flight is further delayed 1 more hour AND another gate change having to take the stairs down - we were told that if we wanted to complain or talk to mgmt, we would have to go to the counter OUTSIDE the security area of course, we wouldn't have time to do that and clear security once more - so after a total 3.5 hour delay, we finally board the plane... only to sit on the runway for another 1.5 hours. The crew blames the traffic on the runway. At this point, I was half expecting to being forced to disembark - when the plane finally took off, all the passengers started sarcastically applauding. - throughout this entire ordeal, none of the staff or crew apologized and kept saying ""they just work there"". We were never offered anything of any kind. In talking with friends that live in Vietnam, they all told us they would have advised against flying with this airline had they known earlier. Now we know. And now, hopefully you know too. I vow to never fly with them again, even if it were offered free."

Luckily I had screenshot the original selection and they reassigned me to an aisle after a lot of stuffing around. No online check in, so no bag drop. Everything done manually. Check in is a nightmare where you stand in a queue for over an hour with a thousand other people then they realise that they have no hope of getting everyone checked in and then call out the flight to check in in a different location which still takes ages because they do everything manually and don't use enough counters. Boarding was chaos, late and via many busses. Reasonably new looking A320. The flight itself was absolutely full. Seats are cramped- and I'm only small. No in seat power or any entertainment for the 8 hour flight. No soap in any of the toilets. None. Tiny meals (only one for ""deluxe"") with only 1 small bottle of water supplied. Lovely staff. At the gate 40 minutes late on landing and bags took about an hour to arrive on the belt with only one other flight landing ahead of us on the quiet Friday night at BNE.

The crew were nice and helpful. No IFE system or food service (snacks were for sale only), but that did not matter for an one-hour flight."

I purchased a return flight ticket from Suvarnabhumi Airport to Narita International Airport. The transit airport was Ho Chi Min Airport. They delayed the departure time from Suvarnabhumi Airport to Ho Chi Min Airport from 7:00 pm to 12:00 am without prior notice. As a natural consequence, I missed the second flight from Ho Chi Min Airport to Narita Airport, which was scheduled to fly at 11:30 pm.

This is the most poorly managed flying experience I have ever had and I take many flights with many different airlines. They told us we were boarding, ripped tickets, piled us into buses and then drove us around the tarmac. Then eventually returned us to the terminal and collected everyone’s tickets. People who refused were demanded they return their tickets. Then there was a scramble to call out names and redistribute everyone’s ticket. What an actual nightmare.

The process took just a few minutes, and I was off to security & Immigration and was very satisfied with the service. However, when I arrived at the airport in Ho Chi Minh to return home to Thailand on May 20th. I was refused any priority check in even though it states on your website that I am entitled to this because it was an international flight, and I booked a Deluxe round-trip ticket. I was told by ground staff that they do not provide any special service on Deluxe ticket holders. I had to stand in line for 45 minutes to get my boarding pass! After getting my boarding pass, I went to the service counter to ask why no one knows what type of service a Deluxe ticket is entitled to.

Checked in from HCM to Da Nang at 4pm for scheduled flight at 6.10 pm and the flight was delayed for 1 hour with not a notification nor a single explanation even though the whole family and other passengers were seated right next to the crew representatives. At 6.55 they called to get in line for boarding; everyone in-line for 20 minutes and the crews asked everyone to go back to the waiting seats (no explanation given), finally at 8.10pm we boarded. Missed my concert! The return trip, checked in at 3.00pm from Da Nang to HCM City at 6.10pm, I did not realise the VietJet air pushed my flight to 6.40 until I got to the gate 4.05 pm.

To my horror at landing, my luggage went missing. I informed the crew about that and they calmly asked me what color was my luggage, and that they have moved my luggage to the rear to give slots to the priority customers in front. I guess it was OK for the cabin crew to reshuffle the luggage but at least they should have informed me. When I asked them where exactly it was they could not answer me as they were not so sure. I must wait for most passengers to go down first then the crew can go and search for my luggage. The crew member didn't treat customers with respect. Totally disappointed"

Every time I have flown with this company, my flight has been delayed by several hours, severely affecting my plans. Unacceptable informational support: Information about delays is provided only 30-40 minutes before departure, not allowing passengers to plan their time and adequately prepare for the trip. Disrespect for customers: The company completely disregards passengers' concerns about delays and offers no compensation or even apologies for the inconvenience caused. Lack of accountability: The airline does not disclose the reasons for delays and rescheduling, leaving passengers in complete uncertainty and helplessness. Incompetent staff: Company employees cannot accurately inform passengers how many hours the flight will be postponed, reflecting a low level of professionalism and attention to detail. Poor price-quality ratio: The ticket prices of this airline do not match the quality of services provided, especially considering the instability of their flight schedule. Lack of flexibility: In case of delays or rescheduling, the company does not offer alternative solutions, such as providing other flights or reimbursing expenses for hotels and transportation. Reputation loss: Due to constant delays and incompetence, the airline has lost my trust, and I no longer want to use its services.

They had other, earlier flights that they could have put us on, but NO as they care NOTHING about their passengers. Also I received NO notification from Traveloka regarding the delay.

Check-in was atrocious, really busy with not many counters manned. Some desks closed with staff slouching back in their chairs on their mobile phones and eating and drinking. When we actually got to a desk the girl didn’t even make eye contact, she was on her phone looking at a messenger apps and pictures of sunsets and yelling across to her friends at other desks. Checking-in 2 bags took 15 minutes. Tickets with this airline were about $100pp cheaper than flying with Vietnam Airlines. I really regret not spending the extra money now. By far the worst check-in I have ever experienced anywhere in the world; and I have flown 200+ sectors in the last 10 years. Boarding was unorganised with three lines formed and then staff screaming out “one line!”. Nobody knew what to do as three lines had already been formed so people started to push in on one another. Not the passengers fault as there was no boarding structure or process at all from the ground staff. Boarded the flight on an aerobridge and then was then diverted down stairs to get crammed on a bus. Again ground staff screaming at people to squash more people in. Completely gross experience. On board the cabin crew were actually presentable and nice at face value despite them not being fussed at people on loud phone calls and laughing while the crew was doing the safety demonstration. I found it very distracting. And don’t get me started on the airline theme tune which was played loudly on repeat about 19 times during boarding. I think the words are burnt into my head. I wanted to scream. On board meals were surprisingly not bad for airline food. It was probably the best part of the entire journey. Apart from the $4 pre-ordered SpagBoll, Atrocious airline, atrocious service.

A plane can be late and I am cool with that. But this company is known for cancelling flights due to insufficient number of passengers the day before. The day before my flight, I was notified of a delay and 15 min before boarding, it was announced the delay to another flight which happens to be when the next flight is. On top of this mess, their customer service is very poor and their policies are everything around keeping your money. They don’t care about you or your time. This firm is the definition of violating human fairness. I hope the government steps in to regulate the airline industry or they go bankrupt soon. I never write reviews as I let things go, but this has happened so often and everyone knows about it. They are only alive because their cheap fares serve the very poor.

We had to pass immigration and was not informed that there was a final call. Their excuse was that the airport is a quiet airport when at times there were announcements being made. When we arrived , the staff at the counter were terribly rude and obnoxious. The funny thing is they had the time to remove our bags which were already on the plane but couldn’t let us board which would have taken roughly the same time. What perplexes me is the fact that we were already checked in and past immigration therefore they should have know that we were wanting to fly. We did not intend to show up a couple of minutes past the gate closure and in saying that we just wanted a bit of compassion throughout the situation. After being denied, the staff that took us back out to the ticketing counter was even more rude as she did not speak any English and was not helpful despite us being in distress. The staff back at the ticketing counter could only play the blame game and kept on referring to their policy of gate closure. I understand that I was 2 or 3 minutes past the boarding time but it was not like the plane had left and we were already checked in and done the necessary procedure to check in and board.

They revelled in our misery and even had the cheek to increase the cost from the quote at check in to the ticket desk up one flight of stairs. We had no such issue with Asia Air.

When I arrived to Bangkok everything was closed, so I had to wait 5 hrs for them to open in the morning. Thai VietJet Air sent me from one place, to another place, to another place. Nobody could help me, they were extremely rude. I was crying, in tears ""please help me get back home"" and they completely ignored me, avoided looking at me. I've never been so disrespected by an airline before. All they said is email the airline, but I'd have to wait 8 hrs total till they open. And even then, how long will it take to respond to my email? It was a disaster. They didn't take accountability for the delayed flight. I had to pay again. Why would I give them more money? Will I ever get reimbursed? Who knows.

As soon as they announced the plane was ready for boarding a “team” arrived with two luggage scales and forced everyone to weigh their carry-on and other personal items (their weights combined could not exceed 7kg). My bags were 11kg and the team leader immediately yelled at me. Was incredible. She was yelling before I had a chance to say anything. No employee anywhere would feel they could get away with that how unless they were trained to do so and given authority from management above. We were leaving on an international flight and had no leverage to say anything. She took my boarding pass and immediately I was hostage to pay $75 for an extra 3kg in my combine bags. The whole experience was traumatizing and I’m not exaggerating in saying this. There were many real confused and upset people including a woman broken down in tears. The “team” would simply say it was not their problem and to pay or not get on the plane. The lady had a handful of boarding passes she had collected and was running about to get as many as she possibly could to collect the money after. It was truly obnoxious. I will never trust and fly with this airline again.

Besides the toilets did not refilled with soap and when I asked for soap, they poured a bit on my hands and later placed the bottle inside the toilet thereby making it inconvenient and unhygienic for all travelers.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh to Bangkok,January 2023,3.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  The worst airline experience in my life. The staff checking in the luggage weighed up every single thing we had, including laptops and phones, and made us pay $95 for 7kg extra weight, which could only be handed over and could not be taken into the cabin. The funniest thing is that we flew to Vietnam by the same company 07.01.23 from Bangkok, and there we paid nothing extra for the same amount of luggage. Perhaps this was his first working day and he wanted to curry favor. Being on the road the whole previous year and having flights every month, we first encountered this problem. I don't recommend Vietjet to anyone."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chiang Mai to Bangkok ,October 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We booked in September to fly Vietjet from Chiang Mai to BKK so we could make our Flight on Bangkok Air on to TRAT. Unfortunately, Bangkok Air didn't have a connecting flight anymore. So we booked the 6 am flight from CM to BKK on Vietjet. weeks later, Vietjet canceled the 6 am flight and put us on the 8 am, which would have never gotten us to our flight on BA, to get to TRAT. I emailed 10 times, and all i got was Vietnamese letters, texts, and never English. I kept saying i didn't speak Vietnamese and couldn't understand what was being said. I went to the website and wrote from there, and always got a language that i couldn't understand. We had to fly Bangkok Air to BKK a day ahead, staying a hotel, and leave for Tratt on BA, the next day. While in the BKK airport, i went to the Vietjet counter, and they said to email again, and nothing would happen. They were right. Now, my credit card said that the dispute Went to Vietjet, because in their liabilities (on website ) says that they are not responsible for anything. The nice lady read the letter, that was now in English (from their bank) That indeed, they can cancel, stop, do anything they want, and they are not responsible. Never fly Vietjet, ever."

Extortionate extra baggage fees. Beware please! Flight cancelled without a word of explanation, leaving us waiting for hours. The cancellation appeared to have been done deliberately, simply to allow the airline to combine our flight with a later one, and thereby increase their profits, with little concern at all for the passengers. Extremely uncomfortable seats with almost zero degree recline. Baggage left behind!! Scheduled landing 2pm, baggage still not arrived, currently midnight. Absolutely the worst airline service I have ever experienced. It seems from these reviews that I am not alone. Absolutely terrible."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to Saigon,January 2023,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,2,no,1,  I bought a ticket online about 20 hours before departure. After buying it I noticed that I switched 2 letters of my name (might have been autocorrect I have a unusual name). I understood the responsibility was mine to fix and I hoped for some customer support could fix the situation even if I have to pay some service fee or some sort to make my travel experience as hassle-free ass possible to secure a good and positive memory with this airline...I was wrong. I immediately went on the customer support of VietJet Air to correct the mistake. The customer chat on their website was as helpful as a three year old. Their website runs like it was made in 2010. The English knowledge of their support team was embarrassing for a travel industry. It took them more than 3 hours overall just to tell me I need to go to the check in counter at the airport to fix it. Having to wait 10-20 minutes for each reply in a very repetitive and obviously google translated English. After giving me some hope of being able to change it at the counter I was told to come 4 hours before the time of departure. It was tiring but it needed to be done so I obligated. Arriving at the VietJet Air counter I explained the simple matter of the spelling mistake to the best of my ability without creating further confusion which can happen very easily apparently. The women understood the mistake and asked 3 multiple co-workers to look at the problem. After a very short and disappointed conversation the worst case scenario was being fulfilled and I was told to buy a new ticket. Of course without my money back. And with 3 times of the price I bought it for. If the chat support had told me to just cancel the ticket and buy a new one I would have done so. Maybe even just buy a new one overall but sadly I trusted this airline not just being a money hungry corporation with having the intention of having their customers actually wanting to come back. All overall I made 2 mistakes - Switching the letters - thinking VietJet Air could switch them back.

At the airport in Phuket, a staff member at the bag collection belt inspected the broken bag and said we could claim 200 THB compensation. I requested to speak with her supervisor, who explained that their policy is to offer 500 THB compensation. I wrote to their customer service who confirmed they don't offer higher compensation than this and agreed to receive 500 THB, although I made it clear that this was grossly inadequate compensation as the suitcase was four months old and cost 2,000 THB. At that point, Thai Vietjet said it would take up to 45 days to send the money. I emailed them 10 days before the end of the 45-day period, and they confirmed they would send the money within their 45-day period. It has now been one week past that period, and no money has been sent. Their message in response to the email I sent them was a copy-paste of the very first email they sent me, so it seems we have gone full circle. This is a real shame because I really found them a reliable company before this incident and I had flown with them almost exclusively within Thailand prior to that."

Even after booking the premium economy with extra charges there was no difference from the economy class except for a curtain in between. The seats are really uncomfortable even for a 1hr journey let alone 5hrs at a stretch. Everyone who had opted for the premium economy had the same complaints. Bamboo airlines are much better with their service, the seating arrangements, leg space and are comfortable to travel. Just wish they had an international flight as well."

I explained that I flew many times with the cue as a carry on with no issues (including VietJet). Upon attempting to board, they told me my only remaining option was to abandon the cue.

When it’s time I was waiting at the gate and the ground staff announced the flight would be delayed 1hr more so it’s total delay time was 1.5 hr.

We did not have a proof of onward travel for Thailand (which we didn’t need anyway). Had to buy other flight ticket in the moment, but than our booking was still processing with other airways. Payment confirmation was not enough, and the women on the counter was very rude. They did not want to help us, they did not care about us catching the flight. Finally we got through thanks to help from another airline. We also met 2 other (non-vietnamese) couples with “issues”, so they couldn’t checkin. They tried to sell more luggage/other tickets to them for higher prices. To me, this was pure discrimination & scam practice."

I got to the Vietjet desk around 45 minutes before my flight to Chaing Mai. The agent refused to give me a boarding pass because she said I must be there 45 minutes before the fight. If she was more concerned with customer service rather than arguing with me, causing more of a delay, I could have made my connection. She claimed that Vietjet has no managers which I think is untrue. They also would not refund or even help me to get another flight so I could get to my Thai massage class. I spoke to two other representatives and found them all to be rude, unhelpful and not at all concerned about customer service or satisfaction. I would avoid Vietjet airlines just in case you might be delayed because they will keep your money and leave you stranded."

The airline changed the flight time to 12.00 making it impossible to meet connections to go to Australia. When talking to the airline staff they told me that they cannot refund the cost but can book me on a flight on the 16th at 18.50 and I would have to pay again as I was changing my flight. But in reality they broke the contract by changing the flight at very short notice (less than a day). Now I have to spend a night in Bangkok and additional fare at my cost. Very disappointed in the airline. Not very professional at all.

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Denpasar via Ho Chi Minh City,October 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  My biggest mistake was to book through VietJet. They reschedule flights like piece of cake. I had a flight from HYD-DPS. They cancelled it 12 days prior to the trip and dont have any proper customer care in India. After hours and hours of communication with them they finally rescheduled it from Mumbai. Further, just before 3hrs of the scheduled flight from BOM they changed my ticket date from 26th to 27th with 3 hours notice. What is surprising is that my connecting vietjet flight is still 26th. They expect me to time travel and catch up my connecting flight? Anyways i reached airport and got to know the flight was delayed for 4hrs and during that time after a lot of back and forth they changed it back to 26th and i was able to board. It gave me a lot of mental stress! Even the reason vietjet people give for delay is that it is a low cost airline and we shouldn't have high expectations out of it. They dont give meals and even water we need to purchase during the flight. The seats ar super uncomfortable. Only pro was the flight travel time was lesser than expected. Guys spend some extra money and book through a better airline to save yourself from last moment tensions."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denpasar to Ho Chi Minh City,October 2022,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4,yes,8,"  I was terrified having read all these reviews only moments after buying the tickets for my family trip. It painted a vivid picture of something you desperately want to avoid in life. Having taken 100+ flights in my life I interpreted this as a new level of challenge, an adventure and having something to speak about later in life. Despite encouragement from friends to let go of the tickets and questioning my sanity, we decided to go ahead, hope for the best and prepare for the worst. We packed light, haven’t booked accomodation to be on the safe side and came early for checkin. Flights were on time (insignificant delay on return flight due to waiting for transit passengers which I thought is a friendly gesture anyways). Airport checkin was quick and seamless (their online checkin doesn't work but it didn't cause any discomfort). We were even forgiven some overweight on our carry-ons. Water was sold on board. The behavior of airline staff was polite, helpful and respectful. The plane was not more or less clean than any other flight. We received an email 3 days prior to our return flight confirming the validity of the flight (which for some might have been a change in itinerary but it wasn't nowhere near short notice). People were allowed to move freely between seats that were not taken. There were food options on the flight (also vegetarian) As a bonus, we didn't have any of the currencies accepted on the flight (they only took Vietnamese Dongs and USD, no cards) and the flight attendants got together to help my family and exchanged money for us so we can have meals on board using their own phones as a currency calculator telling us they will deal with it later main thing they can serve us.

The onward flight to Chiang Mai on the same day was scheduled for 18:15. When I checked in in Udon Thani, I received the message that my flight to Chiang Mai was delayed by 75 minutes. Arrived at the gate, another delay was announced. It was another 60 minutes. When asked why there was this delay, it was said that it was due to bad weather in Chiang Mai. When looking at the Onlibe weather app, there was bright sunshine. All other airlines that also flew to Chiang Mai had no delay. It was my last booking with this airline.

✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore,September 2022,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,3,no,1,"  New planes on this route but the pesky (and honestly very stingy) weighing scale spoilt the whole experience. While I understand that Vietjet is a budget carrier and i am fully aware of the limitations of a budget carrier, but this is a persistent complaint even amongst the local Vietnamese. Their strict weight policy is meant to fleece unsuspecting travelers. At check in, the lady who checked me in, told me my hand carry was 300gms over the 7kg limit, however she still checked me in anyway. I had on me another small laptop bag containing my device (iPad). In total, my weight was 7.3kgs. Thinking that she has cleared me, i proceeded to do the usual customs check and went to the gate. When it was time to board, lo and behold, there it was their INFAMOUS weighing scale (In all its glorious VietJet Livery no less.) meant to weigh luggages before they allowed you to board. While I understood that some passengers may try to sneak in an extra generous 2-3 (or more Kgs) on top of their 7KG limits, I saw the queue progressing smoothly. Some passengers were unceremoniously plucked out of the queue to have their luggage weighed, while others, with seemingly more baggage and multi-bags were allowed to pass through. Thinking that I am well-within limits since I was checked in anyway, I proceeded to queue at the back. Who knew, the SAME lady who checked me in, plucked me out of the queue and told me to re-weigh my bags. In total - 7.3KGS (inc my iPad). She duly informed me that I had to pay for check in luggage in order to board - a staggering VND950,000 (It costed more than my flight ticket!) By the time I explained to her that I am only 300gm over weight and it is due to my iPad, she staunchly refused to budge and flatly told me to buy the check in fee. At this time, i was already one of the last to board - There was another lady arguing with another staff over her luggage. I exasperatedly reasoned with her that it is 300gms and she was going to charge me VND950,000 (about $60SGD) for 300gms. In desperation, I exclaimed that do I have to throw my iPad away so that I can board? While I understand they are doing their job, the pesky weighing scale at every VietJet air boarding gate is a constant point of ire amongst VietJet travelers. In the end, not wanting to miss the flight, I gave up reasoning with her and paid the VND950,000 and silently swearing off to never fly VietJet ever again, unless absolutely necessary. Fleet planes are new, however, the weighing scale just makes the whole airline feel vindictive, cheap and just very small-minded. I can understand if i'm trying to sneak in 3kgs over the limit, but I'm merely 300gms over. VND950K for 300gms. Now thats a first and will be the last time I'm ever flying VietJet again. Ask any Vietnamese who has flown on VietJet before what they think and I'm sure the weighing scale issue will pop-up."

Then I wanted to change the flight date and destination to something that works for me (although I preferred to buy ticket from another company with better schedule) and i wanted to get the Deluxe ticket which is cheaper, which is the type I reserved in the first place, but when I changed the flight the first time I changed to a Skyboss ticket which is an upgrade that I didn't need to add money for it, and then when I wanted to change ticket for the second time after giving up getting refunded, I couldn't change to Deluxe type, only to Skyboss because downgrading class was not allowed (even when I explained them in email again and again about all this case), but it wasmore than 2 times more expensive then what I paid for my tickets so in order to get it I would need to add lot of money.

Talking to customers with angry voices, unhappy, and looking to customers with sharp eyes. When call light on no body shows up. The light on about 5-10 min so then 1 fly crew come and asking with angry voices and did not listens what customer said. Also talk behind customers back when they leaves the airplane. Like worst customer service, old aircraft, un-nice staff."

The guy at the counter started checking our luggage. One of our luggage was a little overweight so they asked us to separate it in another bag. While we were doing that, they said the counter was closed and refused to check us in even after several requests.  We were charged extra 700 Baht per person for another flight from the same airlines."

They randomly cancelled multiple flights and rebooked them to different days and refused to refund. So it’s as if I just gave them free money. The cabin is extremely dirty. When you close the windows, streaks of black on it. The overhead compartment was also dripping in brown liquid and nobody bothered to clean. This was all upon boarding the aircraft. Disgusting, filthy plain and worse service by scamming my money. Note, I booked 3 flights with them and 2 got cancelled and rescheduled at the last minute leaving me with transportation and hotel problems."

I traveled Mumbai India to Ho Chi Minh Vietnam. Was 3 hours prior at airport. Check-in at Mumbai airport which was supported by just 2 check-in counters. An airline staff comes to us at the end of the queue and asks if we want priority check-in to cut the queue at an charge ₹525 PP. We volunteer and pay. We paid for check-in baggage and preferred seat (though this was known to us) Over the 5 hour odd journey they do not provide you even water.  I offered to pay but they do not even accept credit card, only cash. Unfortunately I did not have any and went though the entire journey thirsty. Seats were vacant and some co passenger requested if he can take an alternate seat once flight departs. The crew flatly refused and said it can be done if they choose to pay for the seat. Duty free shopping also forms part of hand baggage allowance for which they are are petty strict. This is a Visit Vietnam Year 2022. Has anyone come across a more pathetic airlines then this?"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Mihn City to Bangkok,August 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Do not fly with this airline if you have luggage. It is a complete rip off. We went to the airport four hours early because we tried to check in online the night before and couldn't. We were told that we had to do it in the airport. So we went very early and when we got there with luggage in hand, we were told that we couldn't be helped until 3 hours before the flight. At 3 hours before, we went up and were told we had to pay for our bags (which we knew) but that because we didn't pay three hours before the flight, we would be charged extra. It was $50 USD and it was almost more than the flight itself. We explained that we tried online and we tried before three hours and they refused to help. I tried talking to management and they refused to help. So it was pay or don't go. So we paid. I will never fly with them again and I suggest that others don't as they are not a fair airline. I was there early and they refused to help. Even when they did weigh my suitcase, I had to go to another counter to pay. So I wouldn't have been able to pay in advance as they needed to weigh the bags. Never again."

When my wife and I got on the plane, we found that the automatically assigned seats were problematic given the little space there is between the seats, knowing that I am 2m tall and have a foot disability. right. As a lot of seats were free with more legroom, I kindly asked the cabin crew if it was possible to take a seat with more space, since half of the plane was empty. The latter was extremely unpleasant and made me understand that I would stay with my pain if I did not pay for the seat in front. His colleague intended to let me access this place and he intervened. I find it lamentable to put money before the comfort of the customer, especially since these places were not assigned. I have traveled a lot with all kinds of companies and they have never displayed such behavior. So I suffered throughout the journey. "
Not Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phuket to Singapore,August 2022,,,,,,2.0,2,no,1,"  This airline is extremely unreliable. Flights gets cancelled last minute and they claim they have notified you months before. No notification has been sent to us through agency or directly to us. A month before this flight, we purchased extra luggage and the flight status was still active, until one day before our flight, the status showed cancelled. We attempted to call the airline directly with the information found on vietjet air, after being 1 hour on hold, they told us the flight was cancelled on the 13th of June 2022, and any refund takes 60 days to process. This was taken place on the 27th august, more than 2 months obviously, she then hang up the phone and that was it. Now we had to purchase a legitimate flight ticket with Singapore Airlines, 2 hour flight from Phuket to Singapore for $1012 AUD. This taught us a very valuable lesson and I hope everyone here who reads this understand the basic incompetence of this airline. "

The check in girl acted more like a border force security officer. She interrogated me over my vaccination pass, my Vietnam visa, my intended stay in Thailand and then she wanted evidence of my flight out of Thailand. Do Vietjet have a policy of trying to annoy foreign travelers at check in, because my Thai girlfriend was not asked any questions."
Not Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to Denpasar,August 2022,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,4,no,2,"  I am doing this review as I sit on the plane half way through my journey. What an absolute joke. I should have learnt my lesson from previous trips! Never again. I allowed myself 2 hours to check in and get to the gate, grab some breakfast etc for my morning flight Hanoi to Denpasar. The check in queue looked manageable and I anticipated a fairly average wait time.  It took me one hour waiting in line to attempt my FIRST check in. The staff were spending on average 10 mins per person. How does an airline function with such incompetence! The check in staff member looked at my E-ticket blankly and said ‘sorry we don’t have a booking, go to the service counter’. I requested that she check again as I have been queued for over an hour. I am told ‘sorry, go to service counter’. So after 1 hour of waiting to check in that is all thrown out the window. The service desk looks at my e-ticket and prints it out. Nothing more, yes I do have a booking what on earth was the check in girl doing. So back I go and queue up yet again. I wait, I wait and another 40 minutes later I am one of the last to check in for this flight. By now my patience is being tested. I get to the gate and the plane is boarding. I am one of the last to board. I have not been able to stop for breakfast so I am eager to get food on the plane. Food service (like everything else takes forever). Had I known it was going to take 2 hours to check in, I would have preordered food. Finally they come around but ignore me & serve the two Vietnamese next to me. I have to talk loudly to get their attention as they continue on down the isle. I am told they have run out of food. I am in Row 12. How does this happen? I am told Singapore noodles are available but I have to wait 20 minutes. Seriously! They serve the two Vietnamese next to me their Singapore Noodles. I wait patiently for my food only to be now told they no longer have this dish either. I get given some glass noodles with shredded carrot & a sweet & sour sauce satchel. It cost me USD $4 and was horrible. The whole experience is so bad I cannot even put it into words. I have flown extensively in my life and will continue to do so as I travel full-time, but I will never use Vietjet again."

Although the check in and boarding experience has been good so far, the one thing that really lets down the whole experience is the horrendous music and promo songs the airline plays prior to take off. Why not just play some easy listening, calming music rather than the tacky and repetitive jingles. In future I’ll be looking to book other airlines for my travels, there’s plenty of options that play less irritating music."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Bali via Ho Chi Minh City,July 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Have had the most terrible flying experience with Viet Jet.  The crew did not even serve water on the aircraft. In spite of having meals included in our ticket, we were not provided with the meals and were offered a glass of water to complement. The staff did not help, cooperate and had no answers as to why the meals weren't provided for. We had a layover in Vietnam for the VietJet connecting flight to Bali. They charged us for the hand luggage while re-boarding at layover port (Vietnam). We were allowed to carry the same hand luggage while our first boarding at Mumbai airport with the same airline. At Vietnam just before exiting the boarding gates, the staff had our hand luggage weighed. Our hand luggage was 1 kg extra than the prescribed limit, which we then reduced by trashing some food items. They created this whole scene where they didn't understand our language (English) properly and as if the bus to the flight will leave us at the airport if we do not pay the extra charges without considering the reduced weight. They did not even have enough change to the dollars we offered and compelled us to swipe our card to their specified/filled-in amount. Being in a foreign land, there's nothing much we could do. Though we tried to fight for our point, it was in vain. It was a perfectly planned scam by Viet Jet staff, to have the weighing machine placed right before boarding and create a tense environment compelling the foreign tourist to only agree to their terms. Most inhospitable, rude, ill-mannered, irresponsible, cheat, disrespectful staff. Staff with Viet Jet airlines do not understand or pretend not to understand the language (English) to avoid answering any questions asked."

There have been always delays and cancellations when flying with them but this last time was absurd. They have rescheduled my flight without informing me and refused to check me in a lounge or a hotel or even offer any sort of help, they asked me at the office to call the hotline for help and when i called the call center told me that they can’t help me and i should contact the people at the office. I’ve been trying to email them for the past week and they have been ignoring my emails, i had to wait 12 hours at the airport till i finally got to book a ticket through another airline. Vietjet is the worst, won’t use their services ever again and i don’t recommend it to anyone."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Da Nang to Phuket via Bangkok,August 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Without a doubt the worst airline I have ever flown with. Rude, uncompromising and abrupt throughout the whole experience. Check in was slowed down by a jobs-worth attendant that tried to refuse us our tickets as our middle names weren’t on the tickets. He then asked my girlfriend if she was pregnant (she is not, nor does she even look remotely pregnant), and persisted in trying to weigh all of our belongings. Staff on board were also rude, and abrupt with a seemingly holier than thou attitude that is not based in reality if the flight experience I had with them was anything to go by. Our second check in attendant (in Bangkok) made us get all of our belongings out on the bag belt for no apparent reason to “check” - I was apparently wrong in thinking that this was security’s job. Boarding the flight I was not trusted to find my seat (29a) and was chased down the aisle by a hostess to inform me that it was at the back of the plane- a degree seemingly not enough to qualify me to count or read numbers up to 29 in order."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi,August 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  VietJet is by far the worst airline. They will do everything to make you pay more. To start, our e-ticket was missing our middle name, so they asked us to rebook and charged us extra. Second, they waited until we were about to board to tell us that our carry ons were over weight. It was only 1.5 kg over but they never told us this when we checked our bags in. Most airlines will let this go but not VietJet and who ever heard of overweight penalty for carry ons or not having your middle name on the ticket."

The check-in was a total chaos, all flights were mixed, every single person was asked to pay for an excess baggage. My check-in ends at 18h for a departure time at 18h25. Logically, I didn't had time to reach the gate on time, having to go through immigration and luggage control. Result I missed my flight! They refused to refund me saying it was my mistake so I went to the airport police station to fill a complain. The only positive point : my luggage was at the airport because my booking has been processed too late. My previous two experiences, both of the flights were late (3 hours and 1 hour without any information provided)"

Then they changed the departure gate at the last moment with everyone running from Gate 7 to 12. The flight itself was quite smooth. After a short one hour flight Captain announced we were descending and cabin crew to seats for landing. Well thats when the fun began,c abin crew checks done and seated, everyone ready to land and then we circled for 20 plus minutes, no word from the crew as to what was happening. All of a sudden engines surge and we start to descend. As the ground fast approached, it started rocking side to side it seemed he was struggling against winds to line up to runway. Anyway we had a very hard landing Not one single word from Captain or crew or anyone asking if everyone was okay. People were upset, screaming on the landing. Never Vietjet again "

After the terrible experience, where they double charge me for my ticket, I got offered a gift card valid for 6 months. How am I supposed to use that when I live on the other side of the globe? I will gladly pay more and travel with another airline than setting my foot on their planes again. They still can’t admit their mistakes, and are really eager to tell me what I did wrong (misspelled my name). But I already knew that and I told them that in the beginning and said that I can own my mistake. But their response is with capital letters and being so rude. Never experienced anything like this."

Travelled the same route 2 weeks apart, and in both cases, the 75 minutes flight was 90 minutes late. To make matters worse, upon boarding I was ambushed by the cabin luggage team. I had a small carry-on (7 kg) and my computer bag weighing 3 kg. I had the same when checking in and they controlled the weight of my carry-on. The nice lady told me they add the computer bag to the carry-on to reach the maximum of 7 kg, which I don't think is common practice but is their rule. Anyway, I had to pay what represents 50% of the ticket price to account for my foolishly excessive luggage.  how dare they be strict on that type of minor excess when they are stupidly late? For sure my last trip with them."

I flew to Bangkok via Narita and did not require a visa when I arrived. When I pointed this out, they ignored me and when I also pointed out that the Japanese Embassy specifically states they do NOT require a visa for travelers in my situation she again ignored me and told me their policies are clearly stated on their website.

I had a connecting flight in Tokyo a few hours later going to Los Angeles. We had all the proper documentation to board the flight. Upon check in we were told we needed a visa to go to the Narita airport which is absolutely not the case. We flew through Narita on the way to Vietnam and had zero issues transferring flights. It also states right on the Narita airport website and the Japanese Embassy website that travel through the Narita airport is fine. Vietjet customer service is terrible. They would not look at these websites as we told them to do which had the correct information nor would they call the Narita airport in Tokyo to get the correct information. They just denied us entry. On top of this when I asked for a refund the 'manager' told me there would be no refund. I then had one other flight option that would make our connection in Tokyo so I had to book literally last minute those tickets at an enormous cost. Of course once again we had no problems transferring in Tokyo and made our connection. To date Vietjet had not responded to any of my requests for a refund or compensation for the costs I incurred because of their incompetence. I recommend never flying this airline.

It was in a bag and fit in the over-head compartment perfectly. I was the only person using that compartment as well because the flight was only 2/3 full. Six members of staff interrogated me over the guitar and said my carry-on bag was prohibited. They said if I did not remove it from the over-head compartment, I would have to step off the aeroplane. This is a perfect example of machine-like thinking, with absolutely no concern for rationality or open-mindedness. The staff were obsessed with removing this tiny musical instrument from my hand luggage and putting it in the hold, when it was doing absolutely no harm to anyone.

I recommend to avoid them or be extremely careful about your luggage weight. I had to pay around $100 USD for 2kg of carry-on overweight. I was not allowed to re-order my luggage or take some items out. Check out other customers reviews, you will see this is common practice for them. By the way, this 'additional cost' was more than double the initial cost of the ticket. Besides this overweight scam, we had a two hour delay. We had to de-board the plane and were told there was a ""mechanical problem"" (very reassuring). After about an hour of waiting at the gate, we were taken on busses to the backup-plane, where we had to wait for another hour onboard to refuel. Not recommended."

Our whole trip is ruined because of this, because the airline wants to consolidate all passengers from different trips across the day so save cost and increase revenue. Such an awful way to do business. This will be our last trip with Vietjet, and we urge all passengers to avoid this airline at all cost. "

Our flight had planned departure 10.05 am. Since we arrived airport early at 03.00 am from another city, we made a request to Vietjet to put us on an earlier flight after they opened their check-in at 04.30 am. The crew of Vietjet could not help us to change the flight time to either flight at 06.30 or 07.40 even though there were a lot of available seats left, and they excused it that their system would not allow a change to a earlier flight-time. Also there were some issues with our seat-reservation, forcing us to have some other seats than the ones we reserved. In other words the deluxe ticket-group seems to be a big joke for us."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh to Hue,February 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  They have absolutely terrible customer service and show signs of misconducting in their ticket issuing. They always over-sell the tickets and if you don't assign a seat for yourself during the booking process. They will change your flight to any other flight that benefits them, ignoring your schedule without hesitation. It happens to my case when I book a flight from HCM to Hue, departure time @14:50. They change it to 19:40 with no good reason, while my friend booked the same flight but got no change (of course he chose a seat before). The call center offer a solution of flying me to Danang. I mean wtf, is that a solution for you? How am I suppose to travel from Danang to Hue? It doesn't stop there. When I arrived at the airport, the schedule show they expect the flight to take off at 20:45. A total delay of 6 hours which totals my entire plan on that day. I absolutely discourage you to travel with them. "

My mom has aggressive breast cancer and was diagnosed a few weeks before our Thailand vacation. They asked that we send them a specific doctor's note, hospital paperwork, passport pictures, etc. After going through all of that trouble, they refused to give her and my father a refund. They could have just told us that upfront, but wasted even more of our time during what is a scary, stressful and sad time already. The other airline companies all issued us a full refund immediately and didn't ask for nearly the same amount of paperwork. We will never fly with Vietjet Air again!"

I have to buy the ticket from them as I was urgently need to flight and tickets from others airlines were sold out. However they cancelled my flight the day after my purchase without any notification in any form. I have to reach them by phone to have my refund and deal with terrible customer service. They had not only bad attitude but also not willing to refund me money but coupon. I deeply regretted choosing their airlines and never want to be with them anymore in the future. Highly recommend you guys to choose other airlines aside Vietjet if possible."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Surat Thani,July 2021,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  They were not flexible with the worsening COVID-19 situation in Thailand whatsoever. In a time when funds are tight for almost everyone, it should be especially important to offer flexibility. They are offering no refunds for things that are out of people's control and instead only offer either credit or change the flight once. Not even the other options are ""good"" options. Credit time is short and you can only change the flight once (but the covid situation keeps changing!). I do not live in Thailand and therefore am completely losing the money because I cannot reschedule. They have not been helpful at all and I am very disappointed with the service."

If they cancel your flight, or you have to cancel because another flight of yours is canceled (I had to fly with them and take another flight from HCMC but another company canceled all their flights) Vietjet will not refund your money. The worst of the worst, definitely. Never fly with them again. It's better to take any other flight. The service is poor as well, they have like 1000 staff and none of them are capable of doing things professionally and quickly."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chiang Mai to Bangkok,April 2021,2.0,3.0,,,,1.0,2,no,1,"  Terrible company. Charged for luggage we didn't have, just because we asked about it! Terrible company. We called up to enquire about taking extra luggage. It was very expensive (350THB per kg) so we didn't go ahead, and we sent it with Kerry Express instead. When we arrived at the check-in desk they insisted we pay for the extra luggage that we'd asked about by phone! We explained that we didn't go ahead with that, and sent it by Kerry Express instead but they wouldn't let us check in without paying. I've never heard of a company charging you for something just because you enquired about it!?! Exactly the same thing happened to another family at the ticket counter next to us too. So this isn't a one-off. The staff were rude and completely unaccomodating. If you have an option to take any other airline - take it!"
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Chiang Mai,February 2021,2.0,2.0,,1.0,,2.0,5,no,4,"  I flew with this airline several times. They are a very cheap airline but everything you get back will be in a cheap way too. So that's fair enough when the ticket price is very low. I give value for money 5/5 but other things 1/5. The website - Terrible UI, everything on the website based on the Vietnamese language. You may sometimes get notified something in the Vietnamese language and have no idea where to go next. I once received an email header that said the flight was delayed but the email content was in Vietnamese plain text. The service is so so, they will get the job done. Don't expect a fast response on social media or email.  Ground service - most of the staff look unprofessional, always on their phone not actively asking passengers if we need anything. If you have any questions asking them, they will say only ""According to our policy, you cannot."" The air crew staff are average, not bad but noting impressive. I really don't care about the air service because I always fly with them only on short routes. If I have to go somewhere for a more than 2hr flight, I will definitely not be selecting this airline. Personally, so far, I have used their services several times, the flight has never been delayed. I never use their luggage service. Summary: Vietjet is a super low-cost airline that you will get everything back in a low-cost way too. If you are going to travel a short time and not time-critical, they are a fair option. Do research more on other airlines if they offer not much different price, pick them, avoid Vietjet."

I booked the flight online and it was mentioned that the luggage is included. At check in desk they say that I have to pay for it. The price was almost the same as ticket itself. This is real scam, show one price while booking and charge extra in the airport. I would have never booked this ticket if I had known the final price. All staff is extremely rude, doesn't know anything and doesn't will to help. They can't speak English properly and were just laughing. During flight itself passengers around me removed the masks and cabin crew did not react. The man behind me was playing the loud games after the announcement to switch off the electronic devices.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Can Tho to Dalat,January 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  I was scammed on the baggage charges. First issue was that because I flew from Can Tho there was online checking unavailable. Therefore I wasn’t able to go through all the steps of seat choosing and baggage fees. I went to airport with my wife. We were 6 hours before scheduled departure. Straight away I went to VietJet to ask about checking in as I was worried I wasn’t able to do it online. We had 2 large suitcases and 2 pieces of hand luggage. I nicely asked how would I check in as I wasn’t able to do it online. I was told I am too early and have to wait until 2 hours before departure before I can do it. Therefore we went to have some meal and waited for our time. When the time came we went to VietJet as advised by their staff and wanted to check in. There we were told that we have to pay 1.1 million VND for the baggage because we didn’t buy it in advance. When I said I went for the advise 4 hours ago and was told to wait and I’m not happy to pay they said we will not fly with this baggage and issued us only tickets. I went back to that exact woman asking why didn’t you tell us we have to pay for the baggage now but instead you told us to wait 4 hours. She was very unpleasant and said we should have known that without her telling us. Without any other option left I had to pay 1.1million for 2 pieces of 20kg each baggage. I would like also complain about their website. Things there are not clear. You are not being guided properly. Once unable to online check in you should be told what to do next. I guess this is how they decided to make their money. Avoid avoid and avoid again!

The airline didn’t respond to emails and the phone number never connected after several attempts. We arrived early to the airport expecting a fee for the name change but instead were ordered to buy a new ticket and new luggage since my checked luggage was under the original booking. Total almost 2000 Baht which was completely unnecessary and caused ridiculous stress. The check in counter attendants wore Christmas hats but boy did they lack any Christmas courtesy let alone any customer service skills. They were rude and had one answer for everything.. ”no can, company policy”. My friend also had tried to pre pay checked luggage and was unsuccessful in her attempt. On the day, they charged her 1100 B for 1 case which is ludicrous. Clearly this airline is struggling financially but I can tell you, it won’t be around in a year’s time. Poor customer service and poor policies."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Phuket,December 2020,3.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Flights rescheduled. Chose this airline just because of their departure time (I’m traveling with a baby, so I tried to schedule the flight to my baby’s nap time). VietJet offer flights to Phuket (from Bangkok), an hour a flight which at that time I thought was incredible. Turned out, it seemed like they tried to fool people that they offer a lot of flights with different departure times, but in the end all those flights are combined into the same flight. Booking number doesn’t work on their website, had all the booking number, but can’t do anything about my flights on their website. (I wanted to book and pay for additional luggage) - called the call center dozens of time, wait more than 10 minutes every time, and they never picked up my call. I sent an email asking to book and pay for an additional luggage. Told them on one picked up my call, yet they insisted me calling the same number to make a payment. Again, called them dozens of times; no one picked up. - Booked and paid for 3 persons, but upon checking in, the data showed only 2 person and I had to go through their process, which took about 1 hour, just to confirm my payment. Since I couldn’t call and make a payment for an additional weight, I packed my luggage light (even I’m traveling with a baby). However, I had to pay for the weight I didn’t carry, or else I wouldn’t be able to check in.at that time I thought “ That’s it. That’s enough. I had had enough, I’ll just pay and get this thing done”, so I paid. Now that armed me whose stuff are in the bag? I said all 3 of us (my wife my baby and I) are sharing the same bag. You wouldn’t believe what the ground staff told me. “Passengers are not allowed to share the same luggage”. A father, a mother, and their baby can’t share the same luggage? That’s’ it; I yelled at the staff and told them how ridiculous they are. A moment later, after that staff talked to her boss (yes, she did ask if 3 of us can share the same luggage), everything was ok. I got my boarding pass. Had my bag loaded. On the plane, I had my baby sat on my lap over my seatbelt, and cabin crew walked up and told me “the injury occurred to your baby is not our responsibility” and walked away. She didn’t even wait for my response. Seriously? Is that the first thing you would say when you see a baby in the flight? Not the first low cost airlines I flew, but definitely the first low quality airline I flew. In conclusion, there’s nothing good about this airline apart from the plane arriving safely."

They asked us to buy the ticket for my child! ok I agreed but after that they said there is no seat for my child, so I cant buy the ticket. I call Vietjet customer service but they all say ""sorry we cant do anything"" then the staff come and tell us, if my child want to fly i have to pay $100/one way.

They ignored the older women and allowed them to carry their small purses and hand bags, their priorities are all messed up.

✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Economy Class,Phuket to Bangkok,September 2020,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,2,no,2,"  The incompetence and rip-off start when booking. First the booking site is awful and you have to do and redo to get there. For instance you select the language(choice of 5 or so), select the country and, if not careful your phone will have Vietnam code. More importantly options have to be opted out. A rip-off. You select a 600฿ Seat and end up with 1600 because the site booked a 14 kg bag ( on both legs) and a priority check in . Then they add tax airport charges. 600 becomes 1150 and when you pay you get another 100 for your credit card 600฿ Becomes 1250฿. Then you buy an emergency exit for 250฿ - they change the plane configuration and you end up on a normal row while no one is sitting in the emergency exit. Many other faults. These should be enough to discourage any honest person from flying with them."

Qatar Airways allowed us to use our tickets at a later stage and the accommodation in three cities in Thailand was cancelled, even though some were paid for and non refundable. Thai Vietjet bluntly informed us that we won't be able to use our tickets at a later stage. Mails from me, to determine the reason for that, was ignored. This, after they stated on their website, that you'll be able to use it at a later stage. I would understand it if the cancellation was due to my wrongdoing, but who could've foresee the pandemic!?

I strongly discourage flying with them."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Phuket,July 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Absolute scam, will cancel your flight and refuse to refund, saying you can use the credit for a later date. When you try to do that, you're unable and at that point it might be too late to dispute the payment with your financial instution. VietJet canceled my flight and refused to refund my money, saying I could transfer the ticket to new dates of my choice. I transferred the ticket to new dates, asking at the same time for a name change on the ticket. I received flight confirmation, which showed the name change I asked for was not completed. I followed up with 2 phone calls and 3 emails to correct this and VietJet did nothing to make it right.  VietJet told me I could not board the flight they switched me to, and that they would not refund my money or even issue credit back for the money they took from me. The company seems to have theft as a corporate policy, and I encourage you to book with any other provider both to protect your own money and also to support ethical companies that treat their customers right."

I booked two flights for instance where they didn't send me a confirmation or any information about one of them. They sent a lot of emails about the first one, so naive as I was, I didn't properly check my email. On the airport, I was forced to book a new one on the spot. Even though I could prove that I paid for the missing flight, they couldn't retrace it. Months of emailing (service desk and calling several numbers didn't work) went by with them constantly replying after a week or two. Very frustrating, but they agreed in the end in paying it back, minus the 40 dollars cancellation fee. So be sharp when flying with this company and know that you take a risk of them screwing you over. The good part? The tickets are still super cheap compared to others."

I tried to contact them but was unsuccessful. Then tried to contact Skyscanner through which we booked the ticket. After so may emails and phone calls, as other airlines offered options for my other tickets including vouchers and full refund, Vietjet Air response is just merely ‘NO’. The call operator kept saying they could do nothing to assist; it was totally nothing they could do; It’s Taiwan government’s responsibility for it. We didn’t ask for the full refund, we then asked how about the tax and fee, could be request back because I didn’t fly. Again, answer is ‘No’, nothing. And she even tried to argue with me when I said that I was very disappointed of how they treat their clients, there was no support at all meanwhile we tried to contacted them so many times and in many ways. I have never filed with them, and I will never do. The worst airline ever I’ve had."

Was told I couldn't board due to visa restrictions 14 March, pointed out that the restrictions came into effect 15 March but still wouldn't let me board. Asked to change the ticket or refund at the airport, told it's not possible - you need to contact customer care. There are two phone numbers, one rings but never connects, the other connects but the only words you will get out of the customer service desk if you are not fluent in Vietnamese is ""hello"". Two email addresses, neither answers. Another dissatisfied customer. Worst airline I have ever encountered."

On 22nd December 2019 we had a flight from Phu Quoc island to Ho Chi Minh city. It was an early morning flight and after landing in Ho Chi Minh we should have 7 hours to our next flight. Unfourtanely our flight got canceled, but the saddest part is that we were not informed before about cancellation and change to an alternative flight. When we got to the airport we could not find a check-in for our flight. When we asked about our flight in Viet jet ticket office. We experienced awful service, they were unresponsive. They did not try to help us and repeated 'What is your problem?'. Also, they said there is only one flight today to Ho Chi Minh city and there are no free seats. In Phu Quoc international airport there was not any free wifi service and we could not book flights through the internet. In other airline ticket offices were the same story - no seats left. In the end, Vietjet gave us new tickets for the next day. When we arrived at the Hotel we checked all flights from Phu Quoc and it turned that there were almost 8 flights to Ho Chi Minh. We missed our next flight from Ho Chi Minh and we received no compensation in the end. In summary a very bad experience. I would not recommend this airline, just not worth it. It is better to pay a little more to other airlines to receive great and safe service."

They have sent me an email stating that my flight was canceled and I should contact them either by email or a call on a ""1-900"" phone number where you actually have to pay extra to speak to them. Long story short, I sent them several emails over the days without answer. Finally I had to call and their decision is ""this route is canceled, you can either get you money back after 15 working days or reschedule to some other month if the route starts operation again"". What a joke! Basically I bought a ticket to fly me from A to B and, since the company decided to cut that flight, they will just kicked me out and refund my money after 15 working days (which has passed and I still didn't get the money back). Now I will probably have to spend more money calling their ""1-900"" service, to hopefully get the refund. Will never fly this airline again."

The Da Nang to Hanoi flight was moved 5hrs from a preferred early time, thank God that my flight back from Hanoi to Manila was 5-6 hours away. Also, I noticed that their aircraft is dirty. I know that this is a budget airline but I think they will still respect their clients' time and always stick to the booked time. Delaying flights ruins a lot of itineraries. "

No real reason for the charge was given, just that there was a balance to pay. Against our better judgement, we paid up just so we could get on the flight. To add insult to injury we can't find any way to complain to the airline or get a refund."

I arrive at the airport expecting to fly home only to discover, after queuing for 40 minutes to checkin, that my flight had been cancelled. Rude checkin staff would not refer matter to a supervisor. Forced to queue for an ignorant salesperson who eventually got a supervisor. Didn’t have booking reference number because of no email, so would t look further. After some forceful words I was offered a flight 24 hours later, no hotel or compensation offer. More hard negotiations saw a seat “appear” on a flight to TPE. I accepted. Wait ten minute was 30 minutes and even then it was incomplete because they had to manually enter the new itinerary into more than one database! Finally, 35 minute later than scheduled departure I’m in the air, with an additional seven hours travel by two busses to get home. VietJet care factor zero. Avoid at all cost."

It bluntly deceives its customers in the price they will be paid to actually get there flight. I had two flights and both of them had changes in times by hours. One flight was moved 3 hours earlier.  Using their site is like gambling on one arm robber machine. Once I bought a disgusting meal on an hour flights I never wanted or realised I bought. Second time even though I did not get the cheapest flight and checked the fare them seem to suggest that checked luggage is included I ended up paying 35% more. Making my economy class ticket amongst all airlines flying the same. The amount that I was told to pay at the counter increased by 20% by the time I actually swiped my card. Outrageously ridiculous.

I proceeded to record a video for evidence and he started to say we need to delete the video or get our flight cancelled. At the end we had to pay 50usd for a rigged scale.  Never flying them again.

Yet they wanted to charge a penalty of more than half the ticket price based on a return penalty for both sides of the arrival, departures. And this double booking was done on the same day as each other and I informed on the same day. Visa and my bank refunded the full amount but this incident shows you should never book with Vietjet online.  My friends in Vietnam warmed me about this airline but because they were cheap I never listened. I paid for my mistake with lots of stress."

By the time we realized what was happening they already took both our bags and sent them on their way. Staff during the whole time quite unfriendly and unsympathetic. Very unhelpful.

In total we had 4 flights with VietJet air and the only flight that wasn't delayed was cancelled. Every flight we would get an email the night before stating the flight would be delayed, an hour on average. Also, VietJet air is the only airlines that didn't give free food or drinks (including water) on am international flight. The one positive characteristics I have found about VietJet air is that you get to bond with the people who also mistakenly bought tickets about how frustrated they are with this company."

I explained, I am the chaperone and interpreter for my partner and needed to ensure their safety in any country we stay or travel. They proceeded to cancel his flight and told me they could do nothing for me as I was able to fly to Bali. This was the logic and unethical standard that was being enforced. They can't communicate in English or Vietnamese and they had no means of financial stability as I am the one paying for the tickets and all arrangements.  When addressing the matter with the airport, customer service and corporate office all stated they could not help and reference notes on the system.  Until, we went to the Indonesian embassy. They stated my partner was able to go to Bali without any issues and the airport should have done proper due diligence when trying to exercise any rules or guidelines set by the countries. In fact, the rules were applied for anyone who visited China in the last 14 days due to the Corona Virus and it did not apply to Chinese citizens alone. e were able to secure immediately a visa for the incident at the Indonesian government and received a letter from them to fix the issues. Unfortunately, no one at Vietjet wanted to admit to any mistake or to correct or address the matter. Instead, we were stranded to pay additional fees for the incident and I  received no refunds for the departure flight."

A ticket for 100 dollars will cost you 60 more to change for just 1 leg out of 2. Flights always delayed in this route, this time it became 30 minutes only.

When finally purchased, the manager said I purchased it from the wrong website. When he pulled up the ""correct"" website, it was the exact one I had used. They wasted so much of my time that I missed my flight and they refused to allow me to check-in. I missed my flight, lost money on my hotel reservation, and an adventure experience I had booked in Vietnam.

To made it worse to get into luggage area I still need to do some paperworks. Also I got the information that the flight delay was caused by computer system maintenance of the airline.

She promised to do, even took pictures of our passports. When we arrived at our counter it closed and staff told us they didn't receive any calls or notes.

Flights with VietJet Air are almost always delayed. They are cheap, but definitely for a reason. If you try to reschedule, you’re charged the same or more than your original ticket-or, they ignore your calls, emails, inquiries and hope you miss your flight so they can collect free cash.

We had to Pay $250 for a rush overnight visa for a layover then had to pay $150 for a change fee to HCM and another $150 from HCM to Singapore! And the staff yelled at us when we said we had already paid the change fee once.  Please never take this airline and make sure that if you even just have a transit you may need a visa. The airline never told us we needed a visa for 24 hour layover and this experience was the worst flight and most expensive flight I have ever had. We ended up paying almost triple the amount than we originally paid due to all the changes. And the staff are incredibly rude. Never take VietJet.

I realised that my flight has cancelled at 1040am. The airline change my flight to 730am! And I didn't know at all till I checked my email on 05 Jan 20. I know that I couldn't make it in time. I always wake up around 7am as my usual timing. I tried to call the airlines directly and no one picking up my call. Without much thought, I tried to wake up around an hour earlier. I reached Phu Quoc Airport around 650am. I went to the Vietjet Airlines booth counter and asked for the reason on the cancellation of the flight. I was informed only on 01 Jan 20 thru email. Come on! No one is looking at email on Public Holidays isn't it? That was my thought that came. The officer said there are only two opinions, first is to make a refund to me within 2 weeks, second is that I gotta book another air ticket thru other airlines. So I went to ask around. There wasn't any ticket available at that moment. I have to catch up my bus to Dalat at 3pm at HCM City. I was almost lost but still calm. This is not fair. At the grasp of the moment, there is a staff at Jetstar Asia yelled: I have a ticket! At 740am! I rushed over immediately to grab that last ticket. Paid around SGD$125. But what to do. I'm up to no choice, isnt it? Then I wrapped up every bit of my energy to rush to the belt. Just another 10mins to go.  I manage to get on the plane. When you wanna book a air ticket to PQ, do think about this. Just beware. Ticket can be cheap from Vietjet."

Their ridiculous 7kg carry on weight policy is extremely inefficiently managed as everyone essentially ends up having to wait in 3 separate lines to pay extra to check all their carryon bags.  They forced me to pay 330,000 dong to check my carryon (about $13 USD). Then upon arrival, despite it being a direct, short, domestic flight, they managed to lose my bag. The manager told me that they will only pay 200,000 dong (less than $10 USD) as compensation for a lost bag.  Then I asked if I could at least get back the 330,000 dong they made me pay for the privilege of having them lose my bag, and they refused this too. So not only do they keep the bag they keep the money too, to add insult to injury. Absolutely outrageous."

I was queuing for the check-in when a staff member checked the passengers and their routes. I specifically queued at the desk with my flight number and destination to be extra sure and when the staff asked me where I’m flying he approved that I’m in the correct queue. After long waiting time because of inefficiency of the staff it was my turn. But they did not allowed me to check in because they claimed it was closed 10 mins before. But the flight number was still on the display and the staff member when he checked me didn’t mentioned that I had to hurry / queue somewhere else. Their explanation was that he was part of the airport ground staff - but I expect people that wear official tags from the airline to be capable to distribute correct information! And I don’t see the difference in T-shirt color and can distinguish who belongs to airport or airline staff! So in the end I had to rebook my flight with a few. No apologies nothing - really bad customer service and nobody cares about you.

We arrived at Suvarhabumani Airport 2.5 hours prior to the plane take off. The check-in process for me took almost 1.5 hours because they claim ""we cannot verify you"", what is this? I am traveling to Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam with Visa Exemption Certificate and they said ""we cannot verify you"". They did a bunch of verifications and then asked to sign a waiver that said you are responsible if you are denied entry into Vietnam. I have visa exemption, what a bunch of idiots. To the management team of Vietjet, you need to reevaluate your management of the business and also of your employees. Your plane has many vacant seats due to your unprofessional service that your provide to customers, please take care of this. Customers, avoid them until they get better. "

Then they also denied to allow my hand bag due to 1Kg more weight. They forced me to pay full 20Kg baggage amount which was 35 USD. That was my first experience with any International airline. And you may get surprise that at time of my travel Bali to Ho Chi Minh City just before 1 week, Vietjet staff of Bali allowed me same baggage and same hand bag.  I will never travel again with VietJet Air in future and I also suggest you to stay away from Vietjet. Specially when you have departure from Vietnam."

They can be hugely annoying with their baggage policy of 7kg carry-on. They had a scale at the gate and weighed everyone's carry-ons. I got there holding my laptop in my hand, which is slightly larger than an ipad. They weighed my bag and (after tossing out an orange and a banana), it was under the 7kg weight limit. Then they insisted I put my laptop on top of my bag, bringing the total up to 7.5kg. ""You have to pay 950,000 VND [45 USD] to check you bag, sir."" I answered ""I'll just wear a shirt from my bag."" ""Sir there's no time, the plane is leaving, you have to stay here in Vietnam or pay 950,000 VND."" In the end they let me through, but left quite a sour taste in my mouth. Other passengers in line were not so lucky; one girl had a small-looking bag and had a heated exchange with the staff, but to no avail. They made her check it even though in the end there was plenty of room on the plane. The legroom was also tight, I'm about six feet tall and have normal-length legs, but my knees touched the seat in front."

Appalling experience, bad software, multiple charges not fixed, no response from customer service. Do not book them. Ticket is cheap but it will cost you so much in money, bugs, time and frustration.  Most people say I wish I'd listened to other reviews first and the same thing happened to m. It will happen to you too. It's systematic and everyday policy for VietJet Air. Our experience in just one trip resulted in: 1) 4 full ticket charges for 1 ticket needed (due to bug in their system which as far as i know is still there). Still they refuse to return our funds instead trying to push the problem on to us and our bank. This is a theme you will know well if you book with VietJet. Extra charges on baggage - not applied on checkin but they wait to do this at the gate where they hold you to ransom. You don't get laptop as separate weight, they will weigh every single thing on you and add it up to 7kg. Customer service awful, slow if you get any response at all. they will get back to you in ""3 to 5 days"" but they won't. If you can finally get a dialogue they won't return your money, fix their extra transactions, or admit faults in their buggy system. Both flights delayed by more then an hour. Expect to arrive late wherever you go. "

I’ve flown from Los Angeles to Bangkok, to Hanoi, to Da Nang and this was the first time they even try to weigh it. I weigh 115 lbs, so if my carry on bag was over 7kg but I could carry it, I guess they assumed it wasn’t a problem. Flying out of Saigon on vietjet air, they not only weighed my bag but also my travel wallet (glorified fanny pack). I ended up throwing out a lot of the stuff I came with for an hour flight! I was still 2kg over but the lady let me pass, at the behest of her supervisor (I assume). When I got in line at my gate, they picked me out, as well as two other couples in line. I guess my bag looked extra heavy? I had five books I’d been traveling with, including my 23 hour flight from Los Angeles to Bangkok, and they made me throw out all of them. I had to wear my motorbike helmet and gloves, as well as some of my clothes to bring the weight down. I’d also been traveling with a walking cane because of a motorbike accident, and they made me leave that behind as well for safety reasons. I wasn’t drunk, hostile or difficult, I complied as directed. This was an hour and a half flight.  I’m never flying with this company again and I recommend spending a tad bit more for a flight from literally any other company. I never write reviews but this flight left a dull end to an otherwise amazing trip, so I felt inspired. I hope I helped out someone."

Both of my flights were delayed, to start. When I checked in for the second flight, the woman at the check-in counter made me weigh not only my carry-on, which was under the 7 kg weight limit, but proceeded to make me weight my satchel, 1.5 kg. She then proceeded to say that it was a combined weight of 7 kg for everything. She refused to let me remove my sweater, and demanded I check the bag, and pay the extra fee. Frustrated, when I asked to pay the fee and carry both bags in the cabin, she refused, and demanded I check it. I told her my connecting flight was a tight international one, and that I'd prefer not to wait, but again she refused to let me carry both with me. I was really close to missing my connecting flight as a result, and out of pocket for .2 kg. The flight, despite being delayed was as expected for a low cost airline, you could buy food and drink on the plane, cabin crew was fine."

Travelled with hand baggage only which when weighed at check in was accepted for carry on and an 'approved' tag applied. At the gate I was picked out to have my bag weighed They combine a computer case with the carry on bag and in total it came to under 9kg using their no doubt fixed scales. The thieves then said I had to check it in and pay 950,000 VND around USD40. A callous officer, though not sure he directly worked for the airline as not in uniform or wearing a staff badge, said I had to pay in cash only. I am 100% convinced that money is shared between others involved in the scam practice. Obviously what they do is to have the check in staff approve carry on luggage and then the gate refuse to take on board as they can charge, according to the small print, a much higher penalty. What was most interesting was the profiling. They only checked westerners or those with quality luggage. The locals were let on with no checks and two bags! This just paints a very bad picture of the Vietnamese people who want to cheat and extort foreigners. I use the same bag combination when travelling light and have never had a problem with other LCC's such as Scoot, Jetstar, Air Asia etc Furthermore their website booking is lousy and very complex, most probably purposefully, and what starts as showing a S$150 ticket soon becomes S$250 with all the hidden add ons.

He then shouted at me rudely and said hr must weigh it, then said it was over weight, so I explained it was going in the cabin not the hold and the computer can be taken separately. He ignored me, the case went on the conveyor belt as it was going in the hold against my wishes. He charged $25  for being 2kg overweight. I thought to avoid having a public argument I would pay the $25 and claim it back later. It took 15 minutes queuing to pay the fee and had to go back to see him as he held my passport. I went back and he told me to see security where my case was found to have a battery power pack and I-pad. I then held up another few minutes whilst I was made to sign a form to say the power pack was on board, I then eventually took my computer away. This man created chaos and as far as I am concerned extorted money from me. Anyway I want my $25 back as it’s a matter of principle. "

All foreigners were having issues with the VISA which isn’t the airlines fault but the attendants when asked what to do just laughed and said to google it, it made for some very upset passengers. I would recommend maybe a guide to help or someone they can talk too because the comments from the clerk definitely didn’t help the situation. Next while on the flight the seats itself weren’t terrible, not the comfiest but definitely weren’t bad. The in flight entertainment is your phone, there’s nothing else. So definitely bring a portable charger for electronics. The food was a mess of in itself, they have a menu for food and drink but good luck getting a stewardess to order. We tried multiple times to buy food or drink but we couldn’t get their attention, we tried to use the bell above the seats but that was unsuccessful as well. I highly recommend to bring your own food and drink, or purchase a ticket that has food with it. My vacation was great but it was the only negative and bad experience we had.

First time and certainly the last time travelling with them.  First the staff at the check-in counter told us it is alright to take our fragile goods as hand carry luggage. Carry on luggages and checked in luggages weighed on the belt. Check-in procedures pleasantly performed, no issue at all. Then at the boarding gate another staff started catching passengers with luggage which they deemed not acceptable right when they commence boarding.  They start weighing passengers' hand carry luggage with a big scale. They don't care what's inside and stack all our luggage on top of each other and count to the nearest precision. Then they will say the hand carries are overweight and deny us from boarding before we pay them a fee of 950,000 dong. [This rate is for 1kg to 20kg, non negotiable] Worse still, the check-in counter staff that attended to us earlier was also there but when we raised the issue to her, there was no assistance at all. It was as if that was the first time seeing us. Cold shoulder, period. Just when passengers are good to board, good to go, the airline will caught you by surprise.

In 30 years of flying this has been my worst experience with an airline. I felt extorted by the gate staff and manipulated into paying for carry on baggage or resulting in missing my flight. It's obvious this budget airline has tactics in place to receive extra compensation from customers. The guidelines for carry on baggage says 7 kilos which was the weight of my luggage. They decided to also weigh my laptop and camera which were in my backpack to ensure I was overweight by 1.5 kilos. I pleaded that this wasn't in my carry on luggage this was in my personal item (backpack). The person traveling with me also was put in the same situation which we were left with the option to either pay the $45 USD fee each for extra baggage or miss our flight. We then tried to put our 3 kilo total overage weight in one suitcase to only pay the fee once but we were informed that even though we were traveling together we could not rearrange our items into one suitcase to avoid being charged twice totaling $90 USD. In the end to not miss our flight we paid $90USD. I regret flying this airline, please advise if you decide to fly this airline and take all precautions to avoid being put in this situation."

As usual, flight changes and emails came to my mailbox starting days prior to departure and went on until original departure was overdue. In my case the change was less crucial, but I lost 3 hours due to the continuous delays. What I don’t like is that their emails are repetitive, robot generated, and irresponsible. All their emails do not provide clear changes and do not list old but only new itinerary. Often there are no changes but they cause stress and confusion. Duplicating emails needs also to be very carefully checked as one never knows what/if/how/how much/why has been changed. In this case they cancelled flight VJ306 6 days before departure and put me on VJ304 80 minutes later. That took them 5 emails to communicate. Further delays of new flight added 2 hours delay. Check-in and baggage went fine. I got the best seat onboard without requesting, 11D. Have never paid for excess hand luggage with this airline which contradicts several other reviews. The gates for this carrier is in Saigon clustered into a big hall which is messy and overcrowded like a bus station in a 3rd world country. Always tedious bus gating with lengthy queues, shortage of busses, and long outdoor waits. In the sky they are faultless with fresh crew, clean cabins, and inexpensive catering with many options. This flight was full but CC were handling all passengers perfect. VietjetAir is complicated, tedious, expensive, and risky until you are on board. However, for less busy airports like Hue, they are somehow keeping schedules, especially in the mornings. 35 USD paid would normally be cheap fare but 3 hours delays makes it expensive."

Until this morning I have just received an email from them asking for the same info which I provided at the beginning (a week ago) and their responses via email have been the same questions asking for the info I have provided already. So we have been exchanging email for 7 times as of now and they still dance around with the same questions and no further action taken and neither a call. I even said please cancel my booking whatever I wanna book with another airline and didn’t get any response on that. So basically money is gone and no flight confirmed after 7 days.

For all the flights the time of departure was changed within some hours from the departure. The flight from Hanoi to Da Nang changed from 4.55 pm to 12.20pm, so we cannot be at the airport on time because we were in Ha Long Bay. I tried 7 times to call its hotline (paid number) and I sent 2 emails. They didn't answer any call and only answered my email 2 days after the flight. As we need to fly to Da Nang we paid the change of the flight online (83 USD). When we went to the Vietjet airport costumer care they said that they can't give our money back and we had to go to the airport the day before to change the flight for free. So, they don't have customer care online you by phone working and they don't care about custumers. (I have internet and i see the emails... if i was other tourist maybe I will lose all the flights!) Now I had a flight from Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh at 6pm, they changed it to 9pm, and 5hours before the flight changed it again to 10.55pm Horrible.

They will extort you for more money at the check-in counter. One check-in staff robbed me of 30 USD, daylight robbery for extra check-in luggage. I have traveled to 9 countries multiple times this year with the same one small luggage and one backpack setup with practically the same weight throughout and have never had to pay for extra check-in baggage. A ""cheap"" flight just became 60% more expensive. What's more, they have a cheap wet-market weighing scale at the boarding gate (I am not even kidding) to make sure your carry-on bag is less than 7kg. I gave the staff a death stare and I swear they did the right thing to turn a blind eye. I saw that the couple behind me at the boarding gate queue had to pay extra fees because their bag was over 7kg. They will hold your flight ransom again until you pay the extra fees in USD the same as at the check-in counter. In the end, the flight was delayed for exactly 2 hours. The flight attendants only arrived at the boarding gate to prep the plane 10min before the flight was supposed to takeoff. I would never take Vietjet Air even if you gave me flights for free.

The first flight went smoothly, then I found out that my transfer flight was delayed for more than two hours (for reasons unknown to me). It took an hour and a half to get my transfer boarding pass ticket printed because they had a system error. I waited at the gate for an hour and a half and we were supposed to be boarding by this time, but the woman at the counter said that she didn't know when the airplane was coming. So our flight was delayed again, but the staff did nothing to communicate this to us. When I went to the counter and asked them about contacting the pilot or figuring out what the plan was, the staff got frustrated at me for asking a fair question. In total, our flight was delayed for 4 hours. No one apologized, no one took responsibility, and it truly felt they didn't care at all for their customers. We weren't even offered a drink during a 4.5 hour flight. I read the bad reviews and I thought it would be okay, but I urge you not to make the same mistake I did. Don't take VietJetAir.

That day at 7:30am the plane must have taken off but passengers were still waiting near the gates and there were no information at the screens about delay and no information desk. To inquire passengers had to go out to the main hall but to come back you must go through security checking again. Company representative told that all the flights are delayed because of the training shooting of army in the sea. My flight was delayed for 5 hours. I asked the representative if he was sure about certain time. I told that I would go to the city because I didn’t want to sit 5 hours at the airport. He said he was sure - no more delay, and he was sure that the plane would take off at 12:25 as he wrote at my boarding pass and not earlier. I went back home and in two hours they call me asking to proceed to the plane. Of course I was shocked. Plane flew without me. They moved me to the night flight and it was delayed for 2 hours too. Now I’m waiting for my back flight and I see that it is delayed for 30 minutes. I can firmly state that more than 50% of this company flights are delayed. I use this lowcoster inside the country more than 2 years (because here is no much option) and almost all flights I had were delayed. As for me I didn’t lose anything that day except taxi expenses but I heard conversation between guys from Korea and company representative: they tried to explain him that if they are late to Saigon they will miss flight to China and next flight inside China.

When I came to realise this I told the flight attendant who told me to take the seats allocated to us first, in which I refused as I told him, how can my 7 year old son sit by himself next to a stranger! He kept on apologising instead of sorting it out! Luckily some front row people heard us in disbelief and 2 of them offered us they seat so that my young son and I could sit together!

This was a sheer nonsense so, we had to split them into a small plastic bag. When we got out of the check-in area, there were some of them pulled us over and asked to weight them again. They said we were only allowed to have 4 carry-on items which were 2 of carry-on luggage and 2 small backpack, therefore the small plastic bag wouldn't be allowed to bring onto the plane. This was ridiculous! They also had arguments with other customers and I don't think we've been treated fairly.

I’ve had the worst ever flight experience in Vietnam with VietJet Air. Firstly, our original 06:00 flight from Danang to Ho Chi Minh (VJ621) was delayed by 1h45m and this meant that we would miss our connecting flight which departs at 09:00. We emailed the airline for a change of flight to VJ633 and even asked our hotel receptionist to phone them repeatedly but the customer service team has never responded even till today. We then travelled all the way to Danang airport a day before our flight and our refund request was rejected by the staff as the delay was less than 3h. To be honest, we would never have to ask for refund should they reply to our emails and calls within 3 business days. We then resorted to our last option which meant booking an entirely different and more expensive Business Class flight with another airline (no other seats were available). At HCM airport, the VietJet Air airport staff started picking all the passengers who had suitcases and weighed all of them with the old-school weighing scale. Any bags that were heavier than 7kg would be charged the exorbitant baggage fees. The rude girl shouted at the passengers in Vietnamese / English and demonstrated the worst customer service I have witnessed.  I have never taken any budget airlines that are out there to suck their customers dry of all their money through cancellation of flights, dead customer service and weighing their bags just before boarding. If these are not preventing you from taking VietJet Air, I honestly don’t know what will."

Vietjet Air was half the price of the full-service competition. Both flights were operated by Thai Vietjet, the only difference being the plane staffed by Thai crew. At check in, the line moved quickly. When I asked for an exit row seat, the agent said that she couldn't assign one because I was underage, which apparently was a lie since the website says ""age 15-65"" (I'm 17). So I was stuck with a regular seat. Boarding was in a word, simple. Their first announcement was literally ""We invite all passengers to board now."" I think this is the best boarding method. Both flights had bus gates. I did receive a nice greeting at the door, but the crew seemed to think that de-boarding was the best time to decide what to eat after their return flight. Buy-on-board on this flight had reasonable choice, and the prices were slightly higher than AirAsia. All their non-alcoholic drinks are priced at $1.5 and all meals are priced at $5 so these prices are acceptable. The seat is better than AirAsia, it is the same Recaro slimline found on many other airlines, and legroom is not good, but not the worst. On the return flight, we asked for the exit row and was given it at no additional cost. This also meant that there was misinformation between the ground staff in Bangkok and the head office. On this flight, it was almost identical, with the only difference being an actual goodbye at the gate. In conclusion, Vietjet air is essentially another option when flying within Asia, and there are ups and downs of all low cost airlines. I'd rather avoid them if you are willing to pay for a full-service carrier."

Probably so they can free up seats to sell at the more convenient earlier time. And no on our return here we are in the airport delayed by 3.5 hours. And this is only an estimate so far!

No refund or book to next flight. Spent night in airport lobby and paid the cost of my ticket again to fly another airline the next morning. They only give 15 kg for checked baggage, and 7 kg for carry on. This is half the norm for checked bags, and no other airline has weighed my carry on before. They charged me an additional $300.00 for my bags (nearly the cost of my 1 way ticket again). On top of this, ground staff and cabin crew were rude and utterly useless. Ordering me around with no please or thank you, and one cabin crew actually elbowed me in the nose during the safety demonstration, looked right at me.. and then said NOTHING. Overall atmosphere was chaos. No lines for boarding. Everyone rushing the gate and pushing/ budding in front of the line. Once on the plane, zero etiquette. Shoes and socks came off. Utterly revolting experience. If I could give negative stars, I would. I told the ground staff who refused to refund my flight that they caused me to miss that this was the worst flying experience of my life, and I would gladly pay their competitors just to avoid giving them any more of my money. I will never fly with Vietjet again."

I missed my 2nd flight from Bangkok to Phuket because Vietjet’s flight from Hanoi was delayed so I had to pay more to get rebook to the next flight. Check-in for new flight was a mess. Probably will never use VietJet Airlines again even if their prices are low as u end up paying for luggage and that brings price up when I can use a larger & better airline & pay just as much.

We had a Visa problem, then we rescheduled from VJ802 to VJ806 with the late fee of 2,7778. When we paid the fee, I asked at service counter that we were able to keep our premium seat. She said it couldn't transfer, and never told us to buy seats again. It would be much helpful and save us a trip comeback to buy our seats, otherwise we wouldn't be checked in. (The first airline requests customers buy seats separately). The most disappointing is when I asked why not told me buy seats she replied that ""I don't know if you want to buy or not"". Does that mean she didn't know check-in rule? I wish if they have 0 star option. No service at all."

Arrived at the Airport to learn that my flight had been rescheduled to start 2 hours later. Of course I had not received any notification of this. On top of the reschedule it was still delayed by almost one hour. Looking at the departure board, every single VietJet flight from SGN that day was delayed by at least 30 minutes. For my next flight (VJ 506 Da Nang - Ha Noi), according to Flightradar it was delayed by at least 30 minutes on every single departure over the last week or so - so I know what to expect. Clearly this VietJet has been recklessly expanding their route network without any regard for their capability to actually operate these flights. One can only hope that security is not impacted as badly as punctuality. Other than that it's basically your run-off-the mill budget Airline - basic, no-frills service, cabin attendants are hit or miss. On my last flight the guy was very unfriendly, but usually they are quite friendly. Carry-on policy is on the worse side, with 7kg max. Yet, you still find some locals lugging around 2-3 suitcases per person into the cabin. If you want a cheap no-frills flight around Vietnam and can tolerate camping at the airport for 2-3 hours for a 1hr flight, take VietJet. Otherwise, there are better alternatives: Scoot, Jetstar, AirAsia. Even Vietnam Airlines can be quite affordable, especially on domestic routes."

I decided to experiment with this airline for a couple trips while working in Vietnam. Generally, I recommend against this airline if you're flying for business (or otherwise). No one on their staff seems to have a clue what they are doing. I paid 500% of the price of a standard ticket - twice, for separate flights - and the service is well below acceptable. For instance, nominally speaking I am a SkyBoss customer. Regarding the flight itself this practically means nothing. I am waiting right now for the other people on the flight to board the plane. Literally every one of them. What a nice way to treat a first-class customer. Also, now that I am on the plane, it gets better. So, I booked a first class ticket, am sitting in A4, and I have the same amount of leg room as any passenger on the plane (other than emergency exit seats?). Surely it would have been nice if that was clear on the website? On top of this, they don't even offer a free drink. This is a 5.5 hr international flight - red eye. Like, really? 0/10 would recommend. Oh, did I mention they forgot to announce the flight was boarding?"

Apparently, they sent us a good itinerary 4 days ago when we were already in the middle of the trip.

I was more than willing to pay for it than lose the flight entirely. But then I lost internet connection, so I decided to approach the ticketing counter of Vietjet. The lady in the counter insisted that I buy a new ticket entirely. The new ticket costed about over 4000 thai baht and she told me I must take the last flight at around 22:00PM. She was totally adamant in her belief that I cannot change my flight and if I do change my flight I must take the last flight and the most expensive one.

They took my pillow which was on my lap and stored it in the overhead bin. Did not allow me to put anything in the seat pocket in front of me.  Pillow ended up staying in the overhead bin and was left behind on the flight because they stored it in a separate area from where my luggage was.

The most annoying issue was the fact that the BKK authorities had not listed either “delayed” or “cancelled”. As anyone who has been through BKK is aware, there is a huge walk from one end of the terminal to the other at departures level. Having walked well over a kilometer trying to find an airport enquiry desk, a nice lady at a duty free store informed me where to find one! Locating the desk, I was told the flight was delayed. So why had this not been advised on check-in or posted on the screens? I asked what time they expected the aircraft to depart. I was informed “about 2:00 pm”. Then I asked from which end of the very long Terminal was it likely to be parked. “This end”. Why none of that information was posted on any official departure screen is a mystery - and a disgrace. Eventually gate C1 came up on the screens with a flight departure time of 2:00 pm. But arriving at CI around 1:15 pm, there was another aircrafts at the gate. This had an advertised departure time of 1:50 pm! So how could one plane arrive and depart in around 10 minutes? That was idiotic. In the end, my flight took off a full 3 hours late.

I have sent all relevant documents over the last two weeks to Vietjet Air when it became apparent going to Vietnam for a week was impossible sending, medical statements, discharge papers, photographs of the injuries and X rays, and the last appointment as requested by the airline I asked the consultant for an 'unfit to fly' official document which he graciously produced stating that cabin pressure would be dangerous etc etc I sent a copy to them and now they are requesting more documentation ie the hospital bills we have incurred (which of course I have because I have to send to the insuraners for our medical insurance to cover coats) but why would they need thes ? They also wanted to see marriage certificate to prove we are a couple, we have been together for 20 years and are not married, we are in our 50’s and we are not teenage backpackers (also we are on holiday in Thailand, why would we carry such a document with us). I sent both UK driving licences with the same address in the UK on it and this morning they replied that this wasn't proof. Their customer service is atrocious they could have easily resold the seats over the last two weeks and gave us both a refund or at least refunded my partners seat without all this fuss. I even suggested they could issue a voucher code valid for 12 months that we could use in the future as we will return to Asia by the end of 2019 but this logical solution has been ignored I also tried to say at the beginning that if we could fly, we would, and that we are both suck in an apartment 24/7 as we can't go anywhere as my partner is in recovery, not the best holiday we have had in Asia in the 15 years we have been travelling here. They have just added to the stress of the whole situation and really in the greater scheme of things it’s not an awful lot of money (as they are only looking at my partners booking not mine) and out of pure common decency and compassion never mind good customer relations they should be more professional.

Possibly the worst Airline I have had the misfortune to fly with and notoriously late. Received a late message that the flight was delayed so turned around and headed home. Upon arrival at the airport later nothing was mentioned as to why there was a delay or if there were any more delays. I checked in without any problems plus they checked and tagged my carry on luggage. A half empty cabin bag plus my laptop bag. Once again an announcement was made re another delay, this time more than 2 hours. Arrived at the gate only to see passengers arguing with the staff who were demanding to weigh carry on baggage. People were outraged that they had to pay an additional $90 USD for being deemed as ""overweight"" They slugged everyone with this fee using a block of 1kg to 10kgs over. No warning, no advice from the check in counter upstairs. I argued with the staff who refused to budge. They gave me a choice pay or don't fly. So after two flight delays and zero apology the gate crew added further insult by hitting up passengers for an extra gate fee. I spoke to others on the flight who all claimed they will never fly with Vietjet again. "

However, after an 18 hour layover in Phu Quoc (it is ridiculous) when I walked up to the counter to check in to the connecting flight, they told me I have to buy checked in baggage again. Which is ridiculous. It is a connecting flight. What do they think, I change baggage midway? The staff were rude, they barely spoke English, which is unacceptable at a highly frequented tourist destination. Don’t use this airline, it tries to scam you and get your money any ways they can.

When we finally got on the plane, the pilot did not apologize or acknowledge the delay. When flying it feels very unsafe, movements are very strong and shaky, I never felt so unsafe in any airline. When we landed the bus wouldn’t let us off, so had to wait further 20 minutes. Utter shambles. Will never fly VietJet again."

After we took our seats in the plane, the plane was unable to start so we sat and waited another 30 minutes (if not more) when the plane finally started and we landed they did not have a staircase ready to get us off the plane so we had to wait 20 more minutes. Which was the reason why we are unable to make our connecting flight. We were trying to get help at the Bangkok airport but nobody felt responsible since Vietjet air was not on the floor so we had to wait 5 hours for a representative to show up. After explaining our situation to him he told us to send an email to customer service, but adds that it takes them usually 3 to 5 days to respond! He told us they can’t be held accountable and that they will not assist us, book a new flight or come up for the hundreds of dollars that we lost! We are more than upset and disappointed with this airline and will never use it again! Please do not ever book a flight with this airline. It will end up in a nightmare"

Then on boarding the plane they weighed our bags and said we couldn’t get on unless we paid £30 per bag as they were overweight. Oh but they don’t accept cards. It was then they got super aggressive and told us to pay in cash or get the flight tomorrow. So we did what anyone would do... opened our bags and layered up with as many clothes as possible. We did have to throw some things away too but that’s a small price to pay for not giving these disgusting scam artists another penny. An absolute joke and avoid at all costs.

Upon check in, after waiting almost an hour in line, we were told that our flight was delayed one hour. The customer service representative moved us to the front of the plane in an attempt to expedite our connecting flight. After almost two hours we finally boarded. After arriving at our destination we had to wait another 30 minutes for our luggage. Since our flight was delayed, and our luggage took so long to get, we missed our connecting flight. The customer service counter for VietJet didn’t open for another 3 hours. After they finally opened, the personnel at the service desk were un-knowledgeable. I was given a phone with another customer service rep. and she told me that since the flight was only one hour late, which was actually one hour and 39 minutes late as per their flight delay paperwork that I requested to file my insurance claim, I did not meet the requirement of “2 or 3 hours” delay in order for them to take any responsibility in assisting me with re-booking another flight. They also said they could not provide any documentation that states they would not re-book any flights, for our travel claim. She then raised her voice, as did I, because I was completely surprised by their lack of ownership and accountability. I was then directed to email the customer service information email to which I have never received a reply. Absolutely the most terrible airline experience I have ever had in my life. Stuck in Bangkok at one in the morning, not knowing what to do or where to go, with absolutely no help from VietJet Air, the party responsible for the whole thing. They basically told us that even though their plane was delayed, they didn’t have to help us. We bought new tickets with a different airline for the following night."

By far the most unprofessional airline I’ve had to deal with. I usually never write reviews but this was something else. Booked two flights with them but due to unexpected circumstances I had no choice but to try and change the dates for the flights or get a cancellation. Reached the booking call center, the person on the phone did not know at all how to help, told me to call another office for help, gave me a wrong number. Then I sent multiple emails to which I never got an answer to. When I get to the airport and tried speaking to an agent, out of 6 agents, 5 were just sitting there as decoration and when asked a question, they just shoved us aside and continued talking between each other. Then when the only agent actually doing their job was free, she was extremely rude, she would push me aside in the middle of a question and ask other people that got there way after I did to come see her, overcharged me double the price of the actual ticket just to change dates, continued speaking rudely and giving me orders despite me keeping my calm and trying to be as polite as possible and finally when I was about to leave, she called her colleagues, pointed at me and started speaking behind my back and laughing with them. Never dealing with them again. If you want a good, problem free experience, definitely go for Air Asia. Much better!!"

✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Premium Economy,HUI to SGN,January 2019,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,3.0,4,yes,7," Flew HUI-SGN on 2 Jan. 2018 on an A320. First time for me in their SKYBOSS “business class”. The price is 2-3 times higher as cattle class but includes lounge, 30 kg luggage, lots of hand-luggage, priority seats and gating, and free ticket changes. It was a late evening flight, which endured one of many reschedulings which are symptomatic for Vietjetair. This postponement was announced by three identical emails sent to me a week in advance. Still, we left an hour late, which is, according to flightradar.com, the normal situation for this VJ315 (daily) midnight flight: only 74% of the flights are on time (according to their displayed statistics). The last 2 weeks all of this flight have been delayed every day with 1-3 hours. For me, a minor delay was fine as I had to wait 1-2 hours anyway in SGN to be able to check in for next flight which leaves 5-6 hours later than VJ scheduled arrival time. Check-in opened 2 hours before departure and took me only 2-3 Minutes to get my BP. Lounge granted in Phu Bai Airport is very plain and understocked. However, they are kind and kept the lounge open only for me as I was the sole eligible visitor at these midnight hours. They even extended opening hours another 1 hour to cope with the 50 Minutes delay of my flight, VJ315. Onboard, I was given seat 1C and no-one was seated next to me. Got two choices of hot food and was provided drinks and towel. Food arrived with 2 Minutes after ordering (yes!). Fresh interior in cabin and energetic, young staff. Bus gating in both ends with separate luxury mini-van just for me as the only SKYBOSS passenger went very quick with nil waiting time. My baggage arrived as the first one – it was nicely decorated with priority tags in sparkling colours. Product hardly worth the triple price of a discounted economy, but an interesting adventure with “full on board services”. Got some feel of excellency and I was respected which is truly felt as it is unusual when travelling with LCCs (low cost carriers). The SKYBOSS is not business class but it is a good try. Will fly with them again when I have ample transit time."

Everything is just terrible, extremely high prices for a low cost carrier. Both on my flight from BKK to CNX and CNX-BKK the cabin crew ordered me to sit down quickly since they felt i was blocking the aisle storing my hand luggage overhead. It is not like I was reaching for my bag to take out items whilst people were queuing up behind me. Just simply putting away my luggage after I arrived to my row like everybody would. Seems like the cabin crew here just gets selected based on having a pretty face, instead of looking for good looking girls who actually use common sensea. On the inbound flight to BKK we were told there would be a 10 min delay, no big deal I thought. But after arriving at the boarding gate the delay jumped up to a good 40 minutes without any further announcements/apologies made. When boarding started it was like all hell broke loose, people jumping queues, ground staff terrible at crowd control and we were standing waiting for 10 minutes in the jetway to the airplane for no obvious reason. After a good 10 minutes I saw one of the ground staff brining in a bag of Burger King(probably for the overworked captain/FO/cabin crew, it seemed to be the reason we had to wait so long in the jetway after boarding started for this “special delivery” There was also no special assistance nor attention for the very elderly lady seated next to me so after lading I helped her get her stuff from the overhead compartment before I ran off to find myself a taxi at Suvarnabhumi.

Now mind you that, we just flew in from Detroit to Paris and to Bangkok with the same passport even being granted entry through Thai government, without any issue regarding my husband’s middle name. We requested to spoke to a manager. It took a good 15-20 mins for the manager to show up. The manager was not understanding and helpful at all. He merely told us the same thing and offered no assistance. I requested to see documentation regarding the middle name, the manager browsed through his phone for a good 10 mins and couldn’t pull it up to see me.

So we went at the airport about 8:30 am (flight departure was at 12:10) and the check in hostess said we could buy the baggage, but after they took our baggage they said we had to pay 950 baht. That's cheating. We tried to explain that the website said another thing and that was impossible for us to prepay online or by call center, but nothing, we had to pay cause they already boarded the baggage.

We ordered these tickets ahead of time and there was no mention of a checked bag fee. When we arrived to the check in counter, we had to pay 1000.00 baht per bag! Not only were we inconvenienced by the fee but we also had to leave the long line and go up 2 stories, wait in another line to pay and then go down stairs and wait in line again to show our proof of purchase so they could release the boarding passes they had confiscated! Worst experience ever! We did not even receive any empathy from the attendant. I made sure to check my future flight plans to make sure we did not have any VietJet Air flights so I could cancel them and change to a different airline. I will never fly with them again, never!"

I could not check into the flight one day before which I wanted to since I had an extra baggage and wanted to pay for it. Then when I reached the airport I was asked to pay 923 baht for my 17 kg baggage which was 500 baht on the website (for under 20kg check in) and I was asked to go to another counter of the airlines on the first floor to pay. Meanwhile my luggage and passport is at the check in counter with the ground staff. Thankfully I had my wife, god knows how hectic it would be otherwise to carry my hand luggage etc and manage the payment. Back to the check in point while I was handed over my boarding passes the ground staff was extremely rude and I was told it’s impossible that this was the price written on website and I should have called the helpline number. Now in the boarding queue which is 15 minutes after the mentioned time we were asked to wait in the sky walk area which did not have aircon obviously. We could have easily waited at the departure gate. On the plane the seat is extremely small and uncomfortable. The cost comes out equal if not more to a regular airline so no benefits over there too. Big no on this airline if you love yourself and convenience even 1%."

I've flown Thai Vietjet many times, and have no worries about them at all. The aircraft are clean and appear to be well maintained, the crew is helpful and speaks adequate English. This is a budget carrier, so you don't get meals, drinks, a frequent flyer program, or lounge access. Since most of their flights are an hour or two, you can live without that, can't you? The areas where they really seem to shine are at the ticketing counter, where the wait is usually very short - faster than about anyone else in the region. They're good at inflight service and getting you on and off the plane. The flight I'm reviewing boarded late, but left on time. It was about 90% full. The seats weren't great for legroom, but they compare well to any short haul carriers in the region. Overhead space filled up, but I think they were able to accommodate everyone. Rear of the plane boarded first, so pick a back seat if you are bringing luggage aboard, They don't seem to enforce their carry on restrictions to strictly. Perhaps the biggest bonus of VietJet in Thailand is they fly in and out of Suvarnabhumi Airport, which is better compared to Don Muang: closer, faster, and cheaper to get to, as well as offering quicker security and immigration lines."

I called Traveloka, the booking company and they tell me I have to contact Vietjet directly on this phone number. The phone number doesn't work not once got a beeping tone. So I tried their 24 hour hotline in Vietnam, same deal! So there was no way of rescheduling my flight for earlier, I had to catch the first minibus to the airport (which takes 3 hrs!) to come and make sure I get a spot in an earlier flight. Now I'm at the airport, all my plans for my last day in Thailand are completely ruined (I lost the money for the minibus I had booked for later, for the scooter I rented to visit Old Phuket Town this morning (which I didn't get to see). Now I have to wait 2 hrs for them to even book me into another flight (they have to wait for people to cancel or not show up).

They asked me for all tickets and boarding passes and I provided to them only for them to tell me that actually I was transiting more than 24h.

I had changed this ticket several times through own web booking management and through phone service. The change fees are so exorbitant that’s it’s often better to discard the first tickets and buy new. Whenever I make a change I lose all prepaid services (luggage meals etc.) and must pay these again for the new itinerary. The worst is the numerous emails one receives prior to departure on “possible schedule changes”: it is not clear whether there is change or not and they send again and again – very stressful as you assume there is a change but most often not. Worse are the frequent schedule changes and flight amalgamations that jeopardise plans and make travelling ridiculous. This time I had booked 6 months in advance – but 5 weeks prior to departure they relegated their morning flight to Hanoi making it difficult/impossible for me to use the ticket unless I went a day earlier and spent a night extra in Hanoi. That gave me serious other problems and I had to travel a day earlier to enable me to catch my connecting international flight from Hanoi. That proved difficult and costly. Useless airline unless you are lucky. However, “luck” counts a frequency of only 60-80% of my flights taken with them. I tend stick to Vietnamairlines and Jetstar on domestic travelling in Vietnam. Onboard, Vietjetair are absolutely fine with fresh staff and fair pricing. However, that faints compared to numerous delays, cancellations, and sudden schedule changes. Not an airline for busy professionals but at times it works fine, particularly if paired with patience. The prices are very reasonable if bought through campaigns or well in advance. But when it comes to travel day it will show whether it was worth the savings. They don’t want to “discuss” their own changes – they just assign a new time. In this case, eventually they pretend to pity me and extraordinary “allowed me” a single and unusual date change so I could be on time for onwards international flights. I decided to go with them as another ticket with Vietnam Airlines would now be expensive. It became a bumpy, and tedious process before all details were straightened out (e.g. they tend to cancel meal and baggage and add-ons if they reschedule the flight – just eating up passengers money in a shameful, aggressive behaviour. Flight was full, but service, and FAs onboard were fine, so eventually I had some luck. Onboard, I bought hot meals and drinks reasonably priced. Became delayed 25 Minutes due to “cargo problems” – merely due to too short turn-around time-slot in Hue."

Ticket bought 5 months in advance due to unique good match of schedules. However, as always, they changed and postpone departure 5 weeks in advance to arrive at midnight instead of evening. Eventually, they kept their revised schedule and the flight was punctual for the new time given. Check-in smooth and quick (late Friday). I had two pieces of hand-luggage but could not succeed negotiating with station manager to allow both on board. Thus had to re-arrange luggage and inscribe but no pay as I paid already for 20 kg´s as “add-on” when I purchased the ticket. Bus-gating in both ends are not my favourite. But price was cheap, around 40 USD. VJ are not reliable as they do a lot of long and short-time schedule changes and combine low loaded flights. This change was announced so early that I could still accept it. Nothing much to lose but always an element of gambling and the reschedule cost me the chance of taking alternative airline (VN) and to be home 2 hrs. earlier. Unless I would forsake the ticket and that is where I suspect they have a great (major?) income…Onboard they are surprisingly good and effective and prices for consumption are not outrageous.

On board we had heard horror stories of the service, however on this short domestic flight the food and drinks were very reasonably price compared with Ryanair for example, and the staff very attentive.

I noticed when I arrived at the airport that my name ""Brendan James Long"", appeared instead as ""James Long Long"". When I was redirected to their counter to discuss the issue I was told I would be unable to board as a result of my name not matching what showed on the passport. I asked about changing the name as my email on my reservation displayed my full name, and asked if they could clarify via the passport number that I had submitted on my booking, but was told that I was required to make name changes up til 3 hrs til the flight. When I tried to explain my situation and come up with a solution, the check in agents seemed to fake a sudden inability to communicate in English that hadn't been an issue for any of my friends who had checked in previously. As the flight was coming up in the hour, they then sold me another ticket at double the cost of the original and I was required to go back in line to check my baggage. One of my friends had the misfortune of violating their arbitrary weight max for carry ons and was given a fee equivalent to 60% of his original ticket. Another girl we spoke to earlier in the week had a flight scheduled to leave at 2AM. She had the fortune of having her 1hr flight rescheduled to 4AM about 15hr before the flight. Yay Vietjet! I guess you really do get what you pay for. Terrible customer service, predatory practices, and overall one of the worst experiences that I've had with an airline. Couple this with no online check in and a 30+ minute line to see if they could slap you with a weight fine and we had about as bad of an experience as someone can have at an airport.

Then after that I suddenly received an email from Vietjet regarding my new schedule. If I will fly the date that they gave, I would have to make a lot of re-booking and changes in my itinerary. So of course I cancelled my booking with them and booked with another airline with much higher cost.

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh City,June 2018,2.0,2.0,,,,2.0,2,no,2,"  Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh City. I've flown with Vietjet a few times over my years living and traveling in SE Asia and, unless the flight is exceptionally good value compared to other options, I'd recommend people to avoid. Simply put: their flights are all too often delayed, to the point where it seems they are doing so purposefully (in order to maximise profit/reduce flights, one would suppose). With this airline you should expect to be delayed, so don't use them if timing is of extreme importance. The most recent delay that annoyed me to the point of writing this review was when our original booking of DaNang to HCMC was delayed 3 times. The midweek, off peak flight, departure time of 23.45 (on a Thursday night) was delayed by around an hour and we were notified via email/text at 11.55am... not great but you can deal with it. We were then notified at 18:00 in the same way that the flight was delayed by around 40 minutes. We arrive to a pretty much empty Da Nang domestic airport, check in, and then around 15 minutes prior to boarding, the flight was delayed again to 02:20. This was a routine, domestic, 1-hour-ish flight - come on Vietjet, work out what is going on and, if there will be a delay, be honest and tell us how long the delay will actually be, rather than wasting everyone's time by giving unrealistic times that you might hope the plane will be ready by. So, in short, avoid if you can afford it or if there is another option with a different airline at a different cost because odds are you'll be delayed."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh City,June 2018,3.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,2,"  I don’t usually write reviews but my experience yesterday was so shocking that I feel like I have to. My boyfriend and I have taken four flights while travelling around Thailand and Vietnam and never had a bad experience until taking our flight from Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh City with VietJet Air. First of all, we received an email three hours before our scheduled flight stating that our initial flight had been changed from 11.30 till 12.20. The reason that we had booked the 11.30 flight was so we could get the bus into the centre so this wasn’t good start to our travels. When arriving at the airport, it was clear that chaos reigned. The airport check in desk was a long queue with no order whatsoever to who was next. We wait in the airport having to watch the flight which we were initially on take off. There was absolutely no update about our flight until half an hour before it was scheduled to fly, with the airline just stating that there was a delay. Next thing you know, ten minutes before our time flips back an hour with no warning (and no announcement!) They had simply just changed the flight time, not even leaving the initial flight time on the board. Of course, the flight is even later than this and after a two hour wait for our new flight and a few gate changes, we get on the plane at 1.45. Regarding the other flights, every one was delayed that night and they even flew out a flight which was due to fly one hour after us to the same destination (clearly we were not the priority). We ended up getting out of the airport at half three in the morning after baggage. We were meant to arrive at 12.50 into Ho Chi Minh. If you love and respect yourself please consider not flying with this airline. After this experience, I will never insult Ryanair again."

The new depart time is not match with my schedule then I contact to their call center They proposed me to cancel booking and they will refund my payment back. I confirm to cancel the booking and Vietjet staff confirm to me that I will get the refund within 15 day at the office that I do payment (8BIS office). After 15 days I have call to check with 8BIS office about my refund. They reply that they not yet get information from accounting, please call to check with them again 3- 4 days later. I keep waiting and call to check again. The answer from staff of 8BIS office still the same. They have got no information from their accounting yet. Then I ask them to check with their internal and feedback to me. No feedback from Vietjet team. I call to follow up with 8BIS office again and they still have no answer for me that when can i get my refund. The best thing that they can do is email to ask their accounting. If I need more information I have to call to Vietjet call center. I have to call to follow with Vietjet call center again. They just confirm me that my refund is processing. Then I have to ask them to feedback me by tomorrow. They feedback to me on the next day and inform that they will refund to my credit card within 15 to 20 days after that day which mean that I have to wait for my refund almost 60 days from the day the I cancel the booking.

So I'm here to say it was fine! Keep in mind its a budget airline in Asia. The flight left on time, the seats were standard and customer service good. I pre-ordered a meal (spaghetti), it was fine for airline food, not exactly good, but good enough. My only real complaint is the pre-boarding seemed a bit confusing, just because it didn't start until after I thought boarding should have started and with the previous reviews I was nervous."

When we were planning our trip, we had seen some bad reviews, but in the end we decided to give a shot - also because it was cheaper in comparison to others flight. Don't do our same mistake! Is the first time that I review something, but this time I have to! We booked our flight on March, for the first of May, from Da Nang to Hanoi at 8 p.m and then we should have had our flight back home in Italy with Emirates from Hanoi at 01.30 a.m.. We thought there were plenty of time. But we were absolutely wrong. They rescheduled our flight 5 or 6 times, even 2 hours before the departure. At the end the departure was at 22.40, really late for us. We were at the airport at 7 p.m., trying to change our flight..but everything was full, the only thing they could do was to put us on ""priority"", so we could collect our luggage in a short time. At the desk no one spoke English fluently, just the manager, but at some point I think that she wasn't really pay attention on us, she was just smiling over and over and we were losing our minds. She repeated to us that ""the departure will be on time, no delay, you will have plenty of time to go to the international airport, why are you complaining?!"". We asked, at the customer service, to call their colleagues in Hanoi in order to help us contact Emirates and warn of the delay and to wait for us. They said they dont have the number. At the time of boarding they changed the gate, and of course, it was in the opposite side of the airport. At the end, we took off at 23.30, arriving at the national airport at 00.40. We ran out of the airport, without collecting the luggage, hoping to catch our main flight, but they already closed the check in. We were at 01am. at the Hanoi airport without knowing where to go or what to do. So, please, be wise, spend a little bit more, but do not buy tickets from VietJet Air."

The chinese tourists absolutely hog the counter to check in, very unfair one person in the line and when they in the front 20 more passengers jump with their passports and ridiculous amount of luggage and go ahead, leaving everyone in the line waiting hours. Its unfair, people should line up and go one by one or couples, or small families together not whole big groups at once as there is many people waiting in the line to be helped next and all of a sudden 20 people just appear and push. There is no organisation in the queues."

I have flown more than 1,000 times with over more than 100 airlines and I have never had a thought about needing to write a review for one until now. I feel it is best to warn people to avoid this airline. My gf booked this airline even though we read the numerous negative review but thought that the price was cheap enough to give it a try on a short 1 hour domestic flight. The service is the absolute worst and the most unprofessional I have ever seen in my life. Rude and untrained/unqualified staff. I had to call their manager over and while he was trying to defend his staff, accidentially quoted a rule in their airline which completely rejects his defence. Was really not helpful either all he did was try to back up his staff without any reason. I guess thats what they get taught for this airline, defend you staff first no matter how wrong they are. Really poor customer service. The worst I have ever seen, they literally treat you with no respect. 100% your flight will be delayed, and even though its delay the staff will insist you arrive 1.30 hour before the original time even if your flight is delayed for 2 hours! That means they want you to sit there and wait for about 3-4 hours before your flight even though they know that their flight is delayed since the morning. On top of that the rudeness of their staff makes you wondering if any of them went through any training at all. And remember this is for a 1 hour flight. Now I know everyone experience a “bad” flight once in a while but to experience the exact same thing for both flights there and back is ridiculous. Being a low cost airline with all the hidden costs like for baggage, it's really not cheaper than similar airlines like Air Asia. But I really would recommend you spend a little more for the piece of mind. Again, if you dont want to face any disappointment and worst service you will experience, avoid this airline at all cost."

I had originally booked an earlier flight however the flight was re-scheduled to leave an hour later.

The security line moved efficiently despite only one security officer checking ID's against boarding passes and the limited screening lanes in operation. The flight was delayed by an hour, no reason was provided at the desk. The fleet are fitted with leather seats with a tight seat pitch of 29"". I ordered a Vietnamese rice dish for US$ 3 which was tasty but a small portion by airline standards. I had to eat the meal on my lap as my tray table was broken which seemed to be a common trait across my row.

When I booked the tickets, it said (free baggage/not free baggage) which was confusing so my wife call their customer service in BKK and she was told that there was a baggage fee of 160Bhat for up to 15KG so that was OK with us. What customer service did not say was that you must buy the baggage fee online! When we went to check in, we were informed the fee was 458Bhat! So we tried to call customer service and they do not open until 0800 but we had to check in before 0700! So we tried the website and it would not let us purchase the baggage fee so we were screwed into paying 458Bhat for 12KG. The service people were all rude - on the plane, could not even get a cup of water unless you wanted to pay 120Bhat. They tried to charge you for everything. "

First time we fly this airline for both International and domestic flights. We had good flights with smooth landing, very clear onboard announcement and safety demonstrations from cabin staff, better than Vietnam airlines for both their English and instructions. The cabin carry-on luggage is restricted to 7 kg that needs to improve if possible to allow heavy empty language case as mine that is already 5.5 kg. We understand this is a low cost airlines, so we paid for the extra weight ! On the way back from Taipei, we paid for extra leg room seats when checking in but only 3 seats were allocated on the second row and the other 3 spreading apart in the normal seats in rows 4 & 5. Cabin attendant played nut about this and we had to let go as making issue may cause delay.  Overall, we are happy with all flights but be aware of mistake from ground staff. Check your boarding pass if you travel with a group."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi,March 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Flights are constantly delayed, seemingly by design. Apparently 17% are delayed 3 hrs or more, but I’d say 90%+ are delayed at least 30 mins. I had a connecting flight in Hanoi, left myself some wiggle room but not enough. The problem is Vietjet doesn’t tell you the flight is delayed until it’s already boarding time. But it’s always delayed because of a “late arrival”, often times the plane has not even left the origin city it is coming from. They only report delays when there is no plane at the gate at time of boarding. So I switch flights twice to still make my connection, went through security 3 times, got in line to board 3 times, and got delayed by 2+ hours 3 times. I ended pulling my checked luggage off of the bay and booking with another carrier. They noted I will not be refunded."

This flight with Vietjet Air was on par with most Western low-cost carriers. They offer great fares in domestic Vietnam, and purchasing checked baggage is cheaper than on their competitor Jetstar. However, they cancelled our flight a week before departure and we had to rebook on another flight departing several hours later. Dealing with their customer service via email was quite straightforward. I seriously don‘t understand all the bad reviews here - just be aware it‘s a budget airline (and check your itinerary in advance, just in case they cancel your original flight).

Our flight that was from Hue to Ho Chi Minh was delayed by an hour, the attendant which we spoke to did not give us a reason for the delay and was unapologetic. We called vietjet's hotline and encountered the worst excuse of customer service, where they were unsympathetic to our situation and dismissive of our feedback. I deeply regret for believing for a moment that vietjet was an airline that was competent enough to receive my money. Their customer service is non existent and they fail to deliver on-time flights"

There’s one easy rule when traveling in SE Asia, never ever fly Vietjet! Unless you like up to 4 hours delay and cancelled flights (without any notice or apologies). Canceling flights is a usual procedure when the flight is not fully booked, and the answer usually is ""don’t know. Maybe technical issues"". Also it’s not one or two delayed flights. About 80% of their flights are 1-4 hours delayed. So if you want to spare yourself the connecting flight heart attack or turn a one flight trip into a daytrip - just book with another airline."

Eventually when everyone was so fed up and tired of standing, they announced that the flight would not take off until 2:30 am (the official flight time was 1am). Staffs were chatting and not caring about standing passengers who have absolutely no clue. In flight service was also bad and cabin crew somewhat arrogant. Never again!"

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh City to Hai Phong,January 2018,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Ho Chi Minh City to Hai Phong. This is the worst airline I have ever flown with. We booked a flight with them in December 2017. About 3 days before we were due to fly I got an email with a different flight schedule. No explanation why, no alternatives offered, just an email, out of the blue, with different booking details. I had to ask 3 times by email before I got an explanation. I was then booked onto a different flight, without being asked whether this is the best alternative for me, and without any other possibilities being offered. Only after I pushed back yet again did I find out that I can take other flights to Hai Phong on the same day, or go to a different destination, or cancel the flight with a full refund. I chose another flight; arranging this was far harder than it ought to have been. Vietjet’s customer service at the airport was just as bad. When we arrived to check-in, and despite paying for 1 checked-in bag on the original booking (the one that Vietjet cancelled without consulting us), we found that on the re-arranged booking we were asked to pay again for the checked in baggage. After a long argument we were left with no choice but to pay an additional Dn.330,000. The team leader who handled the matter at HCMC airport was extremely unpleasant, rude and aggressive towards us. He refused to check the original booking and insisted we had to show our booking to prove that we had already paid this charge. He absolutely couldn’t have cared less that we had had our flight cancelled by Vietjet, and couldn’t care less also about the trouble I had to go to in order to rebook the flight that Vietjet cancelled. Unfortunately there was a problem with the Wi-fi at the airport, and I showed him this on my iPad, but he continued to insist that I had to show my record of the booking, and he continually refused to look up the original booking on his own system, which he could have done easily. When I asked for his name, he became extremely aggressive, covered up his name badge with both hands and shouted a number at us very sharply and loudly. When I asked him to repeat it, he not only refused but became even more rude and hostile towards us. Whilst this was happening, a number of different travellers proactively told us that they also continually have issues with Vietjet and that Vietjet’s customer service is dreadful. When we were leaving the flight I noticed one of the pilots was standing by the exit and he was European so I took the opportunity to explain our experience of Vietjet customer service. His reaction: “On behalf of the company I apologise, but I’m afraid I’ve heard many stories like this”. When even Vietjet’s own employees acknowledge to a passenger they’ve never met before that their customer service is awful, it’s very obvious that senior people in the company know this, but choose to do nothing about it. I won’t be flying with Vietjet again, nor will any of my friends, we’d rather pay a little more and fly with an airline that treats it’s passengers with a modicum of respect. If Vietjet is the only means of getting to a particular destination then we will go somewhere else."

Flight VJ802 was supposed to take off at 11.50 am from Suvarnabhumi Airport, Bangkok, en route to SGN at Ho Chi Minh. Done this run with VJ, JetStar, Vietnam Air many times. At check-in, no gate number given. Checked the flight boards many times while hanging around F Gate from where VJ usually operates. At 25 minutes before flight time - five minutes before the gate was supposed to close! Gate No. C3 was finally up on the board. It was a race from F Gate to the other end of the airport, almost 1 km. Took more than 10 minutes to get there. The gate was still closed, with passengers milling around. The gate finally opened and now the board said Estimated Departure time 12.35 pm. But no plane at the dock. The plane finally arrived 30 minutes after the takeoff time. Never ever heard a PA announcement, no gate apology, no explanation. When finally loaded and the door closed, we waited 10 minutes or more. Finally the tug pushed us out, 1 hour, 30 minutes late. Messed up my whole day's travel. Good to see VJ keeping its your record of the second-worst on-time performance in Vietnam. My last flight with VietJet Air."

Customer service was very bad, the flight attendants were extremely rude and unprofessional. While I was struggling finding a space to put my carry-on luggage, and other customers were lining up and trying to find there seats, I wasn’t able to find a space for my luggage, and i had to pull over to one side so others could pass and then I’d find a place for my carry-on later. But at that moment, a flight attendant was standing right next to me, but her attitude and her skills towards her job as a flight attendant was 0. She was just standing with an unacceptable attitude, rolling her eyes, with her arms crossed, and asked rudely if I was done putting my luggage!! She asked: “is that how you put your luggage? Are you done putting your luggage?” in a way that I would never imagine a flight attendant could say to a customer. I’ve always thought helping customers is the reason why we have flight attendants on the flight! Their job is helping and doing service while on board, but what she showed today was completely opposite!! Such an unskillful, unprofessional lady, and her attitude while doing service was out of this world! Thanks to the experience I had today with Vietjet, the worst flight I’ve ever taken in my life, and thanks for nothing. I’d never take this airline ever again in my life! "

We had a connecting flight to HK with Vietjet. The plane arrived late by an hour. By the time we arrived at HCMC, the boarding desks were closed. We were told to take our main luggage as hand luggage and run to the gate with 5 to 10 minutes on hand. It is impossible to pass through passport, customs and buses within that time. We also had a few liquids in our bag. We just could not make the run. They then turned around and said our refusal to remove the liquids from our bags is our fault. We missed the flight. They shifted the blame for their plane being late to us. These both flights were with Vietjet. This excuse and pushing of blame is so unethical.

I sum it up: No food during a total time of 12 hours inside a plane and no clear information. The flight back was also delayed for one hour. The ground service staff seemed to be very stressed and they seemed uncoordinated. The flight was cheap but not worth the price. Furthermore, we did not receive any voucher."

They basically make you line up, and when you ask if you can go to the priority line they ask you if you have SkyBoss membership. Their English is so poor that you cannot make them understand all airlines let families with babies go through the business check in. Very frustrating experience."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phuket to Bangkok,November 2017,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Phuket to Bangkok. Two bad experiences with Vietjet Air My friend and I picked VietjetAir to fly from Bangkok to Phuket and back since this company operate from Suvarnabhumi airport. From here we supposed to fly back to our home country. On Sunday, November 19, our flight VZ308 was scheduled on 14:30 but was delayed till 17:00 when we have started to board. During that time we were directed to several different gates without any communication with Vietjet Air’s staff. I can accept explanation and excuse but no one from company's ground staff didn't address to us, no speakerphone, no nothing. On official display no accurate info about the flight. On company's application no update, only info was on display in front of gates. However, we finally landed to Phuket after more then 3 hours delay. We heard rumors at the airport that Vietjet Air on that day combined 3 flights in one. Hard to believe. Anyway, after this experience we contacted officials at Vietjet Air receiving from them polite answer saying almost nothing. We thought this cannot be repeated in 6 days when we planned to fly back. Lot of people need to catch connecting flights and we thought this will guarantee punctuality. But that was a mistake. On November 25, our flight VZ301 was scheduled at 13:25 with arriving time to Bangkok at 14:55. We had almost 6 hours to catch connecting flight back to Europe via Doha. But Vietje tAir announced delay: first for 30 min, then for another 30 min when we asked what for, the answer was due to bad weather, heavy rain. We were surprised with this explanation since other companies operate normally at the same time?! What is happening during monsoon season? After this explanation we were told that there is no fuel for the airplane so the plane has to go to another airport to get fuel. During 4 hours before we took-off, we were directed several times to different gates. A bunch of freaked up passengers led by less or completely incompetent personnel. Staff from other aircraft companies looked at us astonished. Plenty of different people from Vietjet Air were on the ground trying to help us. They made confusion to other company at the final gate making additional line to board. When we seated inside aircraft we could not take off since something was wrong with list off passengers?! The man from check in began to sweat. He approached to several passengers asking them to show boarding passes. He spent 10-15 min in aircraft. Passengers started to show dissatisfaction more and more. After 4 hours from scheduled departure time we finally took off. You can imagine what kind of running we, and other passengers from this plane, had at the Suvarnabhumi airport wishing to catch connecting flights. We finally succeeded to board our international flight on time thanks to excellent organization of that company and the airport itself. Since that time at Suvarnabhumi and Phuket airports we noticed different low coast aircraft companies operating domestic flights on time with much more professionalism. If we will go back to Thailand, we sure will never use Vietjet Air again. Experience with this company almost ruined our holiday in that beautiful country."

They also showed no urgency in getting the flight taken off and forced us to chance the gate to take off 4 separate times! Trust us, not worth the extra few bucks you save."

The worst part is them forcing you to buy their so call ""weight package"" cause they only give you 5kg for loading on the plane. Their weight package is a package for 20kg. You know at that point what to do you only have to pay. I feel like I been ripped off cause am paying more than other good low cost airline like  Nokair, AirAsia, Lionair etc. First time on Vietjet and never again.

Then on November 4, one day after the flying day Vietjet email me to confirm the flight, that is ridiculous. I don't think that is the way to do business. The customer pay money for nothing.

I’ve booked three trips with this airline from the UK, and on the first two trips I found that I was unable to fit into the seats as I am 6‘1“ tall . I fit into every other airline seat I have flown with. It would appear that this airline has specified a smaller gap between seats in order to squeeze more people on the aircraft. On the first two trips, the staff reluctantly had to move people from the emergency exit seats so that I could actually safely sit down. On the third trip I asked for an emergency exit seat at the check-in, and was greeted with the fact that I would have to pay extra. When I explained that I could not fit into the seats, I was told that it was my fault. They would accept no responsibility, incorrectly blaming Airbus. I was treated very disrespectfully I was made to feel shameful of my situation. I complained to the manager, who in fact was worse than the check-in girl. I would suggest that you fly with a more reputable airline who value customer service and return business."
✅ Verified Review ,A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hue to Da Nang via Hanoi,October 2017,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,3.0,5,yes,7," Flew Hue to Da Nang via Hanoi on 18th and 23rd October 2017. VietJet Air domestic is pure gambling with departures. In this case they cancelled a midday flight 2 weeks before and put me on an afternoon flight four hours later. I suspect they cancel if loads are low and also transfer low-payers to less popular flights if full-payers are starting to fill the flights. At times they combine flights to get more load, but they hide it by giving other reasons. In this case I could manage the change – provided that it did not change again – one never knows. They are not even transparent with the changes – they issue robotically new schedules and have to re-check everything carefully. This takes time and at times these “likely re-schedulings” are sent five times prior to departure. This is stressful and time-consuming – whether or whether not there is a change detected. Tickets might be cheap (promotional fares of zero VND ends up in at least 500,000 VND) - but with add-ons and all kind of funny fees they become de facto expensive and are unchangeable for a reasonable amount (better buy a new ticket). Luggage policy at check-in is unpredictable – at times they are generous – next time rude and merciless. FA staff on board are good, fresh, and nice. Aircrafts fresh and colourful. Menu’s and sales items on board are quite comprehensive and prices are medium, not cheap, but cheaper than in the airport. Mainly bus-gating applies (leave or arrive aircraft by bus). I stopped using them for business and flights with international connections. At times I buy for fun if promotions are on and I am not busy. I then expect nothing and might get a good surprise. The chances that everything goes normal, timely, and smooth from ticket purchase to departure I will estimate being only 60% likely. On monitors in airports they hide delays and do not announce actual departures. These are even hidden (not informed to?) on most flight-tracking tools. VJ international and regional appears to be much more reliable. All the problems they tend to dump in Vietnam. Anyway, how did it go in this particular case? I was maybe luckier than normal as the two flights eventually went on-time (after they rescheduled some days in advance), FA service was good, cabin fresh, colourful and marvellous, well-polstered seats. They were not picky on very big hand-luggage. For the 50 USD paid in total it was a bargain, despite forced flight changes. Aircrafts were in both cases brand new A321s. They gave me the best seats onboard without paying extra. Check-in took 5 minutes in queue which is acceptable. No IFE, but excellent, efficient, and sociable staff on-board making passengers in a good mood. Without all these flight changes (and potential delays) they could be rated up to 9 of 10."

They asked us to choose another flight. We chose the 14.15 flight. 3 days later the informed us there was only 1 seat available (we needed 2). So we opted for the 21.20 (which gave us less than 2hrs transfer time) providing it took off on time. At 10.00 on the day of departure they informed me by mail that the take off time was revised to 22.00. As this was too late I called and cancelled my tickets and re booked with Vietnam Airlines at a cost of £180+. When I contacted Vietjet to claim a refund of the £55 I had paid they refused, saying that as the flight was only delayed by 40 minutes I was not entitled, even the taxes and charges.

I understand that Vietnam's airports are very busy and, in Saigon's case, operating above capacity, but VietJet's consistent inability to stick even close to schedule is extremely frustrating. There is rarely any explanation beyond 'the plane arrived late,' and never any effort to apologize to passengers. It has become a running joke among people living here that VietJet is always delayed.

They were demanding a return ticket which my company have not booked yet as our conference in Vietnam date is not confimed or should there be a delay.  This is my first trip to Vietnam for business and VietJet Air has given me a terrible experience."
✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to Hue,June 2017,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,2,"  Hanoi to Hue. Delays after delays. We have made the mistake of flying with VietJet Air several times. The flights themselves are a classic example of budget airlines. Basic service but cheap tickets. Of all the budget airlines in Asia we have used they are the worst. Our flight was delayed 3 times today, totalling 5 hours. We even paid more for the earlier flight that didn't leave much earlier than the cheaper evening flight. All the VietJet flights out of Hanoi today were delayed as well. This seems to be a trend as they are not punished for persistent delays. Avoid and pay the few extra few dollars for a reliable airline!"
✅ Verified Review ,,Business,Economy Class,Chiang Mai to Bangkok,May 2017,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Chiang Mai to Bangkok. Be careful with VietJet Air. Evening before flight I tried to check in online, but system said that my booking number was not found even I checked it many times. Chiang Mai airport is not big and I live just in 5 minutes from the airport. So I arrived to the airport 50 minutes before my flight, which is domestic and I had no baggage. VietJet Check In counter was absent (I know airport pretty well). It took about 1-2 minutes to figure out where it should be. No signs, just a couple of VietJet employees who told me that I'm too late for Check In. If you have no baggage, and at checkin counter exactly 43 minutes before domestic departure - it is too late for VietJet and they can do nothing with it. In Chiang Mai airport it is just 5, maximum 10 minutes of walk to the boarding gate, including security check from checkin area. So I missed my 2 flights with VietJet and business meeting in Bangkok. I never had problems like this before and it was my first and last experience with VietJet. "
✅ Verified Review ,A320,Business,Economy Class,Saigon to Hue,May 2017,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,3.0,4,yes,6,"  Travelled 11 May, Saigon to Hue. Price was cheaper, but Vietnam Airlines can still be cheaper and would be my first choice whenever schedule fits. As for VietjetAir the price of ticket was fine but I am fed up with the many reschedules, cancellations, and combining (merging) two flights into one) of their flights. Further, the risk of delays is always high. In my case, they reissued my ticket three times in the week up to departure and forced changes to my original schedule. The original flight “disappeared” 4 days prior to departure. So they gave me only one option of a very late flight (arriving Hue 23:30). However, they eventually departed on time according to this latest change. In the Airport they tried to put me on an earlier flight, but it did not work as it was closed 40 Minutes prior to departure. Without luggage I could have made it. On board good service and fresh crew. Luggage service fine and they were not fuzzy with excess hand-luggage."
✅ Verified Review ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh City to Danang,April 2017,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,3,"  Ho Chi Minh City to Danang. Purchased tickets for a weekend away with Vietjet as they had very convenient prices. At the gate we were surprised with a delay. No extra information provided. Then another delay was informed. Overall, under two hours delay but nobody from the airline was able to provide information. When finally managed to speak with someone, the reason, at first was late arrival of the aircraft which then changed to servicing the aircraft. Eventually upon boarding the plane, we had to change seats as the storage/pocket area of my daughter's seat was filthy. The plane had litter all around which was very unpleasant. Waiting for our return flight from Danang now and this flight is also delayed. No one from ground staff around to provide any explanation or updates with new flight time. Needless to say we won't be flying with Vietjet Air again. Below any acceptable standards within the industry."
✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Nhatrang to Singapore,March 2017,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My flight was the 31st March at 9:30am. So i set the my all schedule on that day. And when i woke up on that day. I just got a email from the Vietjet. My flight was changed to 5:30am. It was sent at 4am. And my flight was from Nha trang to Ho Chi minh and from Ho Chi Minh to Singapore. So I could not take all flights. And I called to the center, and they just said they can refund money. It is the best way to help me.  I could not understand the Vietjet airline management system. It is the most terrible airline. I won't take the flight anymore. Their management system do not have any responsibility to guests. They destoried my all schedule. I just cancel my all schedule. So terrible experience. I recommend please do not take the flight for your time and money."
✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SGN to DAD,March 2017,4.0,4.0,,,,2.0,3,no,2,"  While VietJet is a budget airline, I expect better customer service and communication. I purchased tickets for a friend and I from Ho Chi Minh to Da Nang; a month before our flight, VietJet kept emailing me about changes to our flight. Half of the emails were in Vietnamese and several of them didn't actually include new information. Our original fight time was about 11am, but with all the flight changes, it was moved up to 6:00am. At least they notified me about these changes though. While in Hue, my friend and I found out from the receptionist at our hostel that our flight had changed. We were reserving seats on an airport shuttle two days in advance, and the receptionist wanted to verify our flight time. Our scheduled flight of 2:20pm wasn't showing up online when she checked. Upset and confused by this ordeal, I looked up my reservation separately. Sure enough, the flight time had changed, but I hadn't received a single email from VietJet regarding this change. In addition to all of this, upon arriving at the airport, we were informed that our backpacks must be checked because they exceed 7kg. The cost of checking one backpack weighing up to 15kg is ~US$14. We only paid $22 for our tickets. AirAsia has a similar baggage policy, but in the five times I've flown with them, they have never enforced it. The VietJet flight wasn't fuller than any of my AirAsia flights either."
