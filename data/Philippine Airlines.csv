✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Manila to Legazpi ,August 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,yes,10, As a regular traveler in this route I always admire the view when getting close to Legazpi. The view of Mayon Volcano is always a sight to behold. Good thing it was a clear day. The flight left Manila slightly ahead of schedule which was a surprise considering the traffic at MNL Airport. For forty five minutes flight I was given salmon sandwich & coffee which are hard to find nowadays.
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Riyadh to Manila,August 2024,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5.0,yes,10," I want to commend the great service by the crew assigned to our cabin, Sofia Hautea. She did an exemplary job making our flight enjoyable. Flight was early to depart which means we arrived quite ahead of our schedule. I always travel with Philippine Airlines for convenience and excellent service. Though I think they need to upgrade their hard products as they're outdated in today's standard for them to compete with big names in the industry."
Not Verified ,B777-300ER,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Manila,July 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,yes,9, Kudos to all the staff at the counter at YVR for Philippines Airlines. Thank you for the complementary vouchers for all six of us so as for hotel accommodation due to the delayed flight which made our layover more convenient at least. As for the flight crew assigned on our aisle. Thank you so much for your excellent service. Hope to see you again
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Cebu via Manila,July 2024,1.0,4.0,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,1,"   Worst airline i have ever experienced. My friend and i had items stolen by baggage handlers in Cebu. We reported such to PAL on afternoon of 24/07 via phone and whilst the lady i spoke with was very kind and compassionate we have never received a response to such. On the 27/07 we returned to Melbourne and as my friend is a big gentlemen we asked if they could provide seating with a gap in the middle. The lady at check in said this was possible and moved us from row 8 to 23 only to find 2 seats in that row. Air host was fortunately able to find and alternate seat for me which was appreciated Upon return to Melbourne i found my luggage was not on the plane and i have advice this morning that it has just arrived (48 hours later). On a more positive note all of the air hosts were very good on all of our flights. Unfortunately whilst it is a beautiful country with largely wonderful people and i place i have loved diving at, i will never return, such was the profoundly negative impact of the experience."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Honolulu to Laoag via Manila,July 2024,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,1.0,1.0,no,3,"  HNL-MNL flight was delayed which resulted in a longer layover than was planned after my previous connecting flight and extended taxing. All passengers with previous connecting flight (almost all) needed to re-check in at HNL to get new boarding passes and weigh their carry on bags. Only two employees at one desk were doing all of this which resulted in a very extended and crowded wait in line. Strict carry-on bag and personal item weight policy but employees were operating a non-digital scale which is bound to be inaccurate. Meals were sub-par. Seats were comfortable in premium economy but restricting at times. Several flight attendants were using strong cologne/perfume which would have been bearable had they not decided to use the row of empty seats behind me to sleep during which I was suffocating and getting dizzy from the smell. Bathroom floor was sticky and was not restocked with supplies. Towards the latter half of the flight there was no toilet paper or paper towel in the bathroom. Service was severely lacking during boarding and deplaning. MNL-LAO did not have enough overhead space for our carry ons due to the their inability to direct passengers to place their personal items below the seats instead of the overhead bin. Several passengers had more than 1 separate personal items that forced them to store one or more of these items in the over head bin rather than the area below the seat as they should be doing. I was asked to check in my carry on bag to which I said no due to the important items and electronic devices in my bags. When we landed we found out that several check-in baggage and gate-checked carry-on bags did not make it onto the flight due to insufficient space. If there was insufficient space why did they ask to check our carry ons in the first place? None of the nine checked luggage of my family made it onto our flight. No compensation was given for this inconvenience and was asked to travel all the way back to the Airport the next day to pick up the baggage. Which is ridiculous considering the travel time to and from the airport and the packed essentials in those bags. Overall, a disappointing flight on Philippine Airlines. This is not the first time and hope they improve in the future."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Manila to Riyadh,June 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5.0,yes,10,  Let me start by commending the crews both on ground & onboard. Ground crews at Manila check in counters were personable & warm. Didn’t take long to check as have many opened counters for Business Class passengers. On-board service was great too as expected with Philippine Airlines. Thankfully they added several choices of cocktails in the choices. I especially liked Boracay Sunset. Food options were good.
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Taipei to Manila,June 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5.0,yes,10,  Check in was a breeze despite long lines. Agents warm and greeted with smiles. Service on board from crews Aleta and Cessna was commendable. These two made sure that we had comfortable and enjoyable flight. Was offered several refills on our beverage. Asked for extra meal and was happily provided. I cannot thank them enough. One of the best flights I had with Philippine Airlines.
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Daraga to Manila,June 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,yes,10, Ground staff working efficiently. Check in was a breeze and baggage checked through to my international destination despite having a separate ticket. Flight departed few minutes ahead of schedule and arrived in Manila early. Served delicious salmon sandwich in this Forty minutes. Free shuttle transfer from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1. Ticket price reasonable.
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Taipei,June 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,yes,10,"   I have to commend the ground staff who helped us made into our flight to Taipei with only about one hour to do terminal change from T2 to T1, Immigration procedures, etc. Though it wasn’t our fault as it was PR who delayed flight from BIA. We only had total of three days holiday in Taiwan so missing a flight means losing a lot from our itiniraries. But with PR’s helpful ground staff we made it to Taipe on time and as per our itinerary. Kudus PAL!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Manila to San Francisco,November 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,1," I celebrated my 40th Birthday in the Philippines and because of this special day I opted to spend a lot on Business class. Unfortunately their business class was absolutely terrible. While the food was mediocre the real issue was my seat. The seat was broken and if you tried to recline the bottom half that holds your legs up would collapse making your back bend and therefore making it impossible to recline. I basically had an economy seat. After, I reached out to the airline over 8 times, literally. Every single time I was promised by a manager that someone would reach out to me but it only happened on after the 8th attempt. Fast forward, the only thing they offered me was miles and no monetary refund. "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Toronto to Manila,May 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no,1," Sat in Business Class seat 5H and my wife in 5G. Seat setting buttons were not working the entire flight. Media centre did not work for the first 3 hours of the flight after which we were asked to connect our phones to the onboard media wifi and watch movies or listen to music on our phones. Imagine doing this for a 16 hour flight. The air-hostesses were inattentive and indifferent and did not have the charisma or class to offer a Premium class service. The inflight Chief Purser Mr Eric Mariano told us the non-functioning seat buttons problem was an ongoing issue with his airline and even though their staff had made numerous complaint reports of the seats not functioning, the airline had stubbornly not repaired them. I did receive an email from their Customer Service rep who wasn't even reading my emails but just responding with the same standard reply (4 times). I hope Captain Stanley K Ng reads this feedback about how badly his airline is doing and what we the people who pay to fly on it think."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Vancouver to Bali via Manila,April 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,yes,9,   So cool having both the window and aisle seat config in my business class pod from Vancouver to Manila. Attendants were very friendly and encouraging to try Filipino food for the first time. Had a great flight
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Brisbane to Manilla,April 2024,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no,1,"  We booked our flight four months out, the week before flying Philippine Airlines cancelled the flight and rescheduled to the next day so we had to change connecting flights, accommodation and boat transfers which we were not compensated just lots of sorry and refer to website. Got on the rescheduled plane, seven hour flight with NO access to entertainment due to age of the plane, meaning zero screens. Had we been notified we could have downloaded movies for the flight but non disclosure is a specialty with this airline. The staff just told everyone to close the shutters on a day flight so people would fall asleep. We are travelling with a group will never fly this airline again. They really have no respect for customers all about $."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Manila,April 2024,,,,,,,1.0,no,1,"  We've received absolutely terrible service from Philippine Airlines and definitely will not book with them again. We booked flights from London - Manila with them for a large wedding party of 9 people. Having had the flights booked for 18 months, Philippine Airlines cancelled the flight just a few weeks before we were due to fly. It was such a huge problem for us, as this flight cancellation jeopardised our entire wedding. After contacting our booking agents, several alternative flights were suggested to Philippine Airlines, all of which were declined by the airline with no reason given. After several back and forths with this, I contacted Philippine Airlines directly. This led to a long-winded episode of explaining and re-explaining the problem to a host of uninterested customer service agents, eventually taking up over 5 hours of my time on phone calls. Each of the alternative flights were declined for a variety of unconvincing reasons, which I suspect masked the real reason that the airline would lose money actually providing the service that we paid them for. Eventually we were forced to refund the flights and rebook with another airline, losing out on literally thousands on pounds due to the increased costs between when we booked and when Philippine Airlines cancelled the flight at the last minute. I'm now going through the process of claiming compensation from Philippine Airlines, to which they have stopped answering e-mails. Phoning is also difficult, as it's always being referred to ""another department"" who, as customers, we cannot contact directly. Booking with this airline is a huge risk, so please consider other options before making your booking. Learn from our mistakes."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300,Family Leisure,Business Class,Manila to Sydney,March 2024,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,yes,10,"  Overall we had a great experience with PAL. The lounge in Manila seems pretty new and they have a good selection of food that tastes great as well. Besides that the ground staff at Manila is absolutely horrible and super rude. In contrast to the ground staff PAL has one of the best cabin crews out there. Extremely kind and professional all the time and they were all checking on us multiple times. I think I never had such a great cabin crew before. The seats were great and we were able to sleep throughout the whole flight. Furthermore the IFE is pretty solid and they have a great selection of movies. The only thing that didn’t work was the wifi even though the aircraft was equipped with it, but it didn’t really matter to us. Furthermore the food was not the best, maybe because we ordered a special meal, but at least in Business Class you would think it it’s at least decent. Otherwise the value for money was unbeatable, and we wanted to sleep during the flight anyways, so the food wasn’t a big issue. If PAL wants to improve something they really sound work to train their ground staff to be nice and maybe improve their vegan meals (It doesn’t need to be something special, but at least make it taste good.)"
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Sydney,March 2024,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,no,2," My partner and I flew from Sydney, Australia to Manila and then on to Boracay. In the 4 total trips, we paid extra to reserve our seats, months in advance. On every flight our seats were changed and we had to pay to change our seats. On the Sydney to Manila and Manila to Sydney flights which are 6 hour + flights, we had no screens so could not watch anything. This is really disappointing in 2024 for a long haul flight. Leg room was poor. Food was average. No charging ports for devices. Staff were friendly. We will try and use another airline in the future."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321neo,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cebu to Perth via Manila,March 2024,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,4.0,yes,8,"  Flight and cabin crew services were excellent. Despite this, I will not be using Philippine airlines again in future. Main reason being that they wanted $70 USD for an exit row seat (for my flights, with 4 legs, this would have totaled $280 USD, almost as much as the price of the ticket. I'm not sure what airlines seem to be doing with their seats at the moment, but the bases of most of the seats lately have been very hard and uncomfortable. My decision not to use Philippine Airlines again in future was also influenced by my experiences at Manila airport."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Manila,March 2024,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,1,"  In our quest to challenge preconceptions about Philippine Airlines, our anticipation for a memorable flight was marred by a cascade of inconveniences. The abrupt cancellation of our original flight, flight delays, damaged amenities, and a dated hotel experience left us questioning the efficacy of our choice. Despite glimpses of effort in customer service, the overall experience failed to align with the standards we have come to expect from our previous business-class ventures with other airlines."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Changi to Manila,February 2024,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,3.0,no,3," Very bad airline with long checking in queues. Next to impossible, patience required for slow checking in. Service is also not very good with poor food offering. Overall very bad experience."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Riyadh to Manila,December 2023,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,5.0,yes,10,"  It was the cheapest Business Class ticket during the peak season (Christmas Holiday). Service on-board was great with crew being hospitable and attentive to requests. Food was OK, cannot complain about for the price paid. I will continue flying PAL for as long as they keep the price reasonable."
Not Verified ,A330-300,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Manila,April 2023,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,yes,6,"   My flight with Philippine Airlines PR 101 was good, but with some downsides. The moving map was not working and the wifi was also not working, and the flight attendants did not fix those problems. However, the inflight entertainment system was fantastic, but there were no games. The food tasted so good and they were generous enough to give me a hot towel. Overall, it was an okay flight, there are things that have to be improved."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Bangkok,May 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,no,1,"  We travelled with Philippine Airlines some time ago, The staff was helpful and very kind with the check in. Nothing to complain on that. But we are also traveling with our pet dog and online and on the website the price to travel with your pet was about 250 usd. Once we wanted to pay for the dog they tried to ask for 600 usd, we didn't agree to it and eventually we needed to pay a price of 370 usd to check in our pet. Even as the website said otherwise. We mailed and tried to call but no response."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Manila,June 2023,,,,,,,1.0,no,1,"  First flight with them was in May, flight delayed one hour, no big deal for me but staff never bothered to notify, flight back delayed 3 times for four days, again no real problem for me. Flight attendants were good. Second time  in September i had to cancel flight and asked for my refund which i was told will take three months. By December i send them a reminder and they told me it was being processed, by 29th December i received email with ""receipt"" attachment that said refund was credited to my account, no refund in my account. Repeated emails with no replies, used chat function on Messenger 2nd February and after a few hours i again received email saying refund credited to me account, again no refund in actual account. My advice stay away and pay more to a different airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to Manila,December 2023,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,yes,10,  Ground staff at Hanoi airport were great. Bit early so was first in the queue. Check in was a breeze and flight was on time. Food onboard was okay for a three and half hour flight with a choice between pasta & beef. What made this an excellent choice over its competitors was the price. As usual staff service onboard was superb.
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Kuala Lumpur to Manila,January 2024,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,4.0,no,1,"  Transit is primitive to say the least. Went down to get baggage checked in, tiny boarding gate with broken escalator, and Philippine airlines guy refuses to send someone to get my bag  back because my flight leaves later, even though the inspection guys are free. Expects me to wait standing (no seats) for a couple of hours in a small crowded space. Canceled the rest of my flights with them. Who is going to put up that incomprehensible service."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Daraga to Manila,December 2023,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,5.0,yes,10, Flight time was adjusted a few times however it wasn’t a big deal for me since I had a long lay over in Manila. Wonderful staffs at the check in desk. It was a breeze since I already checked in on-line a day earlier and only need to get my physical boarding pass. Ticket was cheaper compare to its competitor.
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Manila to Riyadh,January 2024,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,5.0,yes,9,"  We supposed to leave on-time, however once on the runway queued for take-off the pilot announced the plane had technical problem so we taxied back to the terminal. The repair took almost two hours and we were off. Midflight, champagne run-out or maybe they just didn't want to refill since our flight is coming from Manila which means they must have stocked up on supply. Now as for the technical problem, we can never compromise safety especially with harrowing aviation news nowadays. It is in the soft products more specifically on the meals and beverages that need a bit of improvement. Service was great."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Daraga to Manila,December 2023,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,5.0,yes,10, Flew during the Christmas Holiday rush but things went smoothly from check-in to arrival at Manila. Ground staffs at DRP Airport were all-smiles despite hectic schedule. Departure & Arrival were on-time.
Not Verified ,DH8,Business,Economy Class,Bicol to Manila,January 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,yes,10,"  Travelling back for work after spending Holiday Season means huge crowd and sold out seats. This, however, did not dissuade staff from providing excellent service especially on the ground at DRP Airport. Was warmly greeted at check in. Had an international connection and my baggage was checked through to my final destination despite holding a separate ticket. This means no hassle of collecting and re-checking in at MNL airport. Flight left DRP on-time despite a bit unfavorable weather on that day. I can see Philippine Airlines striving to better their service."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Daraga to Hanoi via Manila,December 2023,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4.0,5.0,yes,9, Travelling to Hanoi from DRP via MNL despite the Christmas Holiday rush PR crew handled it well. MNL to HAN was delayed for about two hours but was informed ahead so no issue for me and it also means enough time to transit in MNL and enjoy the lounge. Price of the ticket was the deal-breaker.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Los Angeles ,December 2023,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no,1,"  I'm currently boarding your flight to Los Angeles with my infant (1yr old), daughter (5yo), and wife. After going through bag check security, and customs, which I disposed of all liquids, I then purchased a coffee and 2 water bottles for my long flight. Just before reaching the gate there is a second security check point. They did not allow me to pass with water despite having my child.  This is my 4th flight on PAL in the past 30 days. There's no in-flight options to purchase drinks. The serving size is tiny and made for a child. Then the next service for drinks is almost every 1-2hrs, or I have to find your missing staff. Then I get a angry look for asking for a beverage.  The attitude of the check point staff and mistreatment of a family with children ois unacceptable. I have been on 8 flights in the past 30 days and your company by far is my worst experience, actually ever. "
Not Verified ,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Vancouver via Manila,December 2023,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,2,"  Wow what a shocker of an airline. Chose to fly with these guys over Air Canada or Qatar - that's a decision we wont make again. Can't fault the cabin crew but the entire experience  especially with a long 24 hour transit time was awful. We had no in flight entertainment or wifi working for a 12 hour flight, the toilet was out of order, the plane left an hour late and took an hour to unload our baggage, and Manila Airport - a cesspit of disease, we had to sit on the floor waiting for our flight. Don't fly with them."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Siargao to Coron via Cebu,December 2023,3.0,4.0,,,,3.0,2.0,no,2,"   They booked me on a connection flight with luggage restrictions. I called them to book the flight because I had extra 20 kg luggage. They added this on the first flight but not on the second, on that flight restrictions existed. Another 30 minutes call with ""sorry, we cannot help"". At checkin in Cebu I had to book an upgrade to comfort class (2500 Pesos for 25 kg) plus 2 extra kg for 700 Pesos."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Haneda to Melbourne via Manila,June 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1.0,no,1,"  I flew from Japan to Australia via Manila. One of my checked luggage cases was left at Manila and then destroyed by customs despite me contacting baggage handling and airline. When contacting Philippine Airline customer service, they offered an apology and informed me they have forwarded my complain to a different department, but no further support or follow through has been provided. An apology is not enough as this was completely avoidable."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Los Angeles to Manila,November 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,1," Philippines Airlines is the worst airline we have travelled on. A 15 hour flight with no entertainment or WIFI. They give you lip service that you are a valued customer and ""We care"" all these words are meaningless. The cheapest airlines to date with food barely edible and filthy seats. You are better off to find another airlines with honest customer service and good service. Although, PAL knew there was no Entertainment they sneakily kept it until boarding when the announce no entertainment. The boarding from LAX was a disaster with no raws or seat numbers just board the plane. Unorganized and chaos."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brisbane to Manila,July 2023,,,,,,1.0,1.0,no,1,"  In reference to my review on the 16th of Sept 2023 - one way flight from Brisbane to Manila for my wife. Flight was cancelled and I had to organise a alternate flight as she had a connecting flight in 2 days from Manila. To this day no refund and we have contacted Trip.com and Philippine Airlines and have been told that someone from the airlines tried to make contact with my wife to place her on a new flight. No one called and we have messaged on numerous occasions requesting for what contact details were used, but no response. Such poor service from the ticket reseller and Philippine airlines. The only positive has been from the last response I received when I posted my previous review."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Denpasar via Manila,November 2023,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,1,"  Don’t fall for the couple of hundred bucks cheaper flights. First of all they changed my flight at least 5 times, then I was forced to shorten my vacation due to this fiasco. I called their customer service at least once 10 times and the only answer I heard was take it or leave it. I was forced to take the next day flight and had a 16 hours layover in Manila. One of the worst airports in the world. Then they send me an email with a bidding chance to upgrade to business. I applied for the departure and about 10 min later I changed it to the arrival from Manila to LAX. After about a week I received an email that my upgrade was approved for LAX to Manila.  I called again and again and opened customer service tickets but they refused to answer me. They said it’s another department. 3 days after my flight (which I was forced again to take business class for a hefty price) they are accusing me of being untruthful. This is the worst experience of my life. "
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Brisbane to Manila,November 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,1,"  All my international and domestic flights with Philippines Airlines had delays or some sort of change on the departure time.  On our flight from Brisbane to Manila, only one flight attendant was polite with the customers. All the female flight attendants were rude and hitting the passengers arms with their food trolley. Not enough, we were not allowed to have the blinds open to have a view or read a book. For some reason it was mandatory to shut the window and the staff closed it for multiple passengers.  On our flight from Manila to Puerto Princesa another change on the departure time with ridiculous short notice. On our flight from Coron to Manila, another issue. Although we paid for extra luggage for my mother-in-law ($62), the lady who was doing our check in charged us AU$120 for over weight. Despite our attempts to explain that we had paid for extra luggage already and despite the fact that the attendant had very good comprehension of the English language, she dogly charged us once again for ""over weight"" luggage. On our flight from Manila back to Australia, 17/11 at 11:35pm, we received an email advising that our flight departure would be delayed for 18/11 at 4:30am. We would be waiting for our flight in the airport for almost 12h. We spoke with the attendants regarding providing us with an appropriate space to rest, like a lounge room, and to provide dinner for the passengers. Apart from laughing about the situation, the Philippines Airlines staff was not able to give us an answer for few hours. We ended up sleeping in the airport dirty floor and receiving a bottle of water and a bag of crackers as ""dinner"". Not enough, other passengers advised that they were back in the airport for the 3rd night in a role, as their flights were cancelled twice already. Furthermore, a flight to Perth was overbooked and the staff was begging passengers to volunteer to take another flight. The plane we flew from Manila to Brisbane (9h flight) was so old that the seats were not reclining and they didn't have a screen to watch a movie or a USB to charge our phones. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Taiwan,November 2023,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,no,1," Horrible. They have no inflight entertainment. The one dinner option served was noodles with vegetables that tasted bad. No USB. Didn’t have any drink service as in no soda, no juice, no coffee, no beer. Just water or hot tea. Remember this is an international flight. Not worth the money. I have read all the bad reviews especially about the food so I never used them. But China Airlines somehow used them for one part of my trip. I’ll be complaining to China Airlines about this"
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Barcelona to Manila via Hong Kong,October 2023,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,1,  Worst airline ever. Cancelled our flight with less than 24 hours of notice. Making us lose 770 USD and leaving us stranded for 12 hours. When we asked for compensation (phone service didn’t work and we had to file a formal complaint by email) they offered the pathetic “compensation” of 150 USD in airline vouchers. Never flying with them again.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Busuanga to Bali via Manila,October 2023,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,,5.0,5.0,yes,10,"  After reading  reviews after booking already with the airline I was worried as to how the journey would be. However I should not have been. from booking, to check in to travel, our journey was seamless. We booked a multi trip via the website which was very easy to navigate and saved us money and gave us more baggage allowance than booking separate flights. We were kept informed of any changes by email which were only seat changes, I think maybe due to aircraft change. All our flights were on time, our check ins were all professional and polite and we even got free upgrades on all our outward journeys including at Cebu which enabled us to use the lounge which was very much appreciated. I have flown on many airlines over the years and would not hesitate to recommend this airline. The only thing that I feel could have been improved on was the food which was not good.

Not Verified ,A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Australia to Japan via Manila,September 2023,1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,no,3," My wife and I recently had the unfortunate experience of travelling return with PAL from Australia to Japan via Manila. Flight delays after delays. Return flight cancelled after 12 hour wait in Japan. Segregated from travel group late at night and sent to hotel. PAL Ground staff Osaka advised passengers to lodge claims for out of pocket expenses and confirmed that will be honoured. Claim lodged and response from PAL, insulting passenger offer of worthless $100 USD travel vouchers with PAL valid for 2 years. Our Grand Tour of Japan was ruined by the poor flight experiences with PAL's incompetence at each airport, lack of interest in passenger concerns (connecting flights), excuses and lame apologies that do not change our experience or impressions of PAL. We do not trust PAL after our experience. We did not book flights and would not have flown with PAL via Manila to Japan or economy class (no matter the cost) if given an options. Regrettable flight experience PAL. "

Right in front of the very smelly toilet, of which there was only 2 for over 300 passengers. Extremely angry is an understatement as we missed the 1st day of our tour and also, at our expense had to find them and catch up. It's almost time now to head home and I'm writing this from my motel as we've just been informed our home flight is also delayed and we have to spend an extra 3 or so hours in Manila meaning we will miss our connecting flight. I'm so angry and will never use this airline again. And they broke the wheel on our suitcase and refused to do anything about it."

✅ Trip Verified ,A320 / A330-200,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Kuala Lumpur to Brisbane via Manila,October 2023,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,2.0,4.0,yes,5,"   The checkin at KUL was easy with our bags being checked through to Brisbane, however we were told that our second boarding pass from Manila to Brisbane would be available at the transfer counter in Manila. We were assured that everything was fine & that our seats were as stated on the ticket. So off we trotted to the lounge. This lounge was excellent & was used by a number of other airlines. It was well designed & a pleasant place with a good selection of food & good barista made coffee. Suddenly we were called to the desk. It was a call from the airline asking us whether we would agree to be downgraded to Premium Economy. We declined because of a medical condition. They said ok & once again guaranteed that we would have our assigned seats. The flight to Manila was in an older A320 with no lie flat bed. The service was attentive and the food perfectly acceptable for the short 3 &1/2 hour flight. Upon arrival we immediately went to the transfer desk. It was a zoo. Upon explaining that we were picking up our boarding passes for the flight to Brisbane they informed us that we no longer had the assigned seats and on top of that there was now an additional 4 hour departure delay. We were being downgraded & being offered $1100 (US) instead (Qantas, take note!!). We tried to find out why this was happening & were told a series of lies from a number of different people. In the end we relented because we simply had no choice. We insisted that we have extra legroom in PE & they gave us the first row. It turned out that the previous flight to Brisbane had been cancelled & now they were amalgamating that flight with ours on a larger aircraft. Our seats were, in fact, filled by the crew that would be flying the plane back to Manila. They could have been honest with us at the beginning but they just strung us along. Since returning home we have noticed that this has, once again occurred. It makes you wary about whether this is a recurring issue with their fleet. We are booked to return to KL in February & can only hope a similar fiasco doesn't await us. Manila Airport is a disgrace. Disorganized and chaotic. This is not the airlines fault as such. We found the FA's in the business class segment we flew to be professional and attentive. We were looking forward to the longer haul home to Australia but it was not to be. The food in economy was pretty ordinary and some of the attendants certainly had an attitude problem. I believe that Philippine Airlines has a good business class product however they suffer from the same problem as so many other airlines - a lack of honest communication. I'm hoping like hell that what happened to us isn't an indicator of things to come. If it isn't then I will happily recommend them for their business class."

My brother was un able to come and I cancelled the flight for him months prior. The PAL representative said they can use issue a voucher and I agreed. When I tried to use the voucher I couldn't because it was not my brothers name so I opted for the refund with a $250 usd penalty. 5 months later I'm still waiting for my refund with very poor communication from PAL and an autogenerated msg stating they are working on the refund. While in flight the Tv monitor was inoperative and they were unable to fix it. If you slept through the service you don't get a meal.

They told me 3 billings cycles and yet 5 months later I haven’t seen a dime out of $1800+ refunds and I patiently waited for 5 months for them to give back my money but they never did. So I called them again last July and asked what the heck is going on with my refunds. This time they told me to send them a proof of why I canceled my flights, so I sent them my husbands proof of hospitalization and records of his on going illness. I was on the phone with Philippine airlines costumer service when I sent all documentation and they told me they have received my documents, and same thing, just like the first time from months ago, my refund should be in my account within 3 billings cycles. It has been more than 3 billing cycles and I have not received my refund back."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Sydney,October 2023,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no,2,"   I have no issues with their domestic flights but with their international flights, I have a lot especially the one from Manila to Sydney. Rescheduled flight PR5211. First, the aircraft was an A330. Similar to the one that they've used for SYD - MNL, but this one does not have personal inflight entertainment. It was the most boring flight ever. Also, I was hoping to be able to charge my phone while flying but to no avail because there was no USB port on every seat as well. Why is PAL unable to ensure this? Second, a day before, my flight was suddenly changed. This is very inconvenient because everything has been planned already. For them to ask me to wait for more than 12 hours in NAIA Terminal 1 is just horrible. There is no place to stay there unless you pay for it. Even so, the lounges only allow you to stay no more than 3hrs.  I know that they are not in any way responsible with regard to how they run the immigration checks and all, but that is another pain that we have to pass through every time. I just hope, that as the country's official carrier, you might want to use your voice to streamline the processes on NAIA, at least to make it easier for passengers without compromising security of course. Lastly, when I checked my Mabuhay Miles account, not all my miles were reflected. I guess, this is due to the fact that my flight was rescheduled and flight number modified. Despite this, however, this is another inconvenience that could have been avoided if the departments concerned were doing their jobs properly. Imagine, those points would have just disappeared and forgotten if I had not checked my Mabuhay Miles account. "

Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Japan via Manila,September 2023,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,3.0,no,1,"  The first trip from Sydney to Haneda was surprisingly okay given my low expectations based on previous reviews I had read. The airline staff are very helpful and friendly and great with kids. Unfortunately that’s where the good news ends! On our return leg from Japan the first 5hr trip we had no tv at all with 2 children which is far from ideal. The air conditioning system was throwing off thick white air and it didn’t look normal? You could barely see 3 seats in front of you.  Once we arrived at Manila for our Sydney transfer, we were then directed from our gate to another section of the airport to verify our luggage. This was such a strange stressful process and made no sense at all. All passengers had to put their boarding pass against the window so the baggage handlers could look at it and find your bag amongst everyone’s.They then bring the bags inside where 2 intimidating looking men who were not friendly at all make you open your bags in front of everyone and rummage through it. Everyone had to do this!!! It Was an absolute joke!! If you had a short transfer this would make you miss your next flight. The next unusual part of this leg was checking in to our gate, they make you scan all your hand luggage again and throw out any food or drink. We had just bought food given we had 4 hrs to wait and they made us chuck it out with two kids. Once we entered they made you do this process every time you went to the toilet as there was no toilet in the lounge. Airport staff and the airport of Manila was shocking. Nothing good to say about the place and everything in it. Honesty pay the extra money to fly another airline and avoid transiting Manila airport, really not worth the stress and hassle."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,First Class,Manila to San Francisco,September 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,1,"  Philippine Airlines is not suitable for passengers with special needs, particularly persons With Disabilities (PWD). My son has a disability that necessitates the use of a specialized wheelchair for mobility. With other airlines, upon arrival, the special mobile chair is typically waiting outside the aircraft door. However, PAL consistently fails to coordinate this with the ground crew. This issue occurred when we arrived at Manila NAIA Terminal 1, where the special chair was transported directly to the carousel. We had to create a scene to have the chair brought to the door because their available wheelchairs are not suitable for PWD passengers, as most of them lack seat belts. The same situation arose on their domestic flight when we arrived in Roxas City, and again when returning on the flight to San Francisco. We were forced to use an unsafe wheelchair. Despite our efforts to communicate with the front desk and flight crew, we received no assistance. If you have a family member who requires a special mobile chair, I strongly discourage using PAL for Special Needs PWD passengers. They lack knowledge of the necessary accommodations. We usually choose Eva Air, where we have had no communication problems. Our experience with PAL was a one-time occurrence due to a family emergency."

I'm even an elite member of their miles program - but I've really given up. Unreliable schedules, unreasonable delays (4+ hours with no explanation and apologies) is really very taxing for a frequent traveler. It's one thing to have poor maintenance and scheduling operations, but one thing you can control is how you communicate to your customers. You just send 4-5 hour delay notifications with no remorse."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brisbane to Manila,July 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,1," I booked my wife her one-way ticket to Manila as she had pre-booked her onward flight back to London from Manila. Her flight was to leave on the 2nd of July 2023 at 11:05AM from Brisbane airport (BNE), it was a direct flight to Manila. On the day... the plane was sitting on the tarmac for 2 hours (approx.) and then the pilot announced that the flight was cancelled due to technical issues and they would be re-docking and unloading the luggage. Passengers were informed to return home by ground staff and to await customer services to contact them to rebook on an alternate time/date. My wife had her connecting flight so she therefore required to seek alternatives asap and ended up booking with China Airlines which departed later that evening of the 2nd of July. To this day NO ONE FROM PHILLIPINE AIRLINES or TRIP.COM has contacted my wife to rebook her journey to Manila. Upon her return to the UK, she contacted the 3rd party travel agent whom I booked her one way ticket (Trip.com) to query about a refund. The response from Trip.com stated that they contacted the airlines and was informed that the flight was only DELAYED and therefore no refund would be granted. I then contacted Philippine airlines on their 24/7 number to speak to someone to see if they had any further details on that particular flight. To our amazement, even the airlines had the very same details (delayed NOT cancelled) and asked us to speak to Trip.com as they could not assist. I stated that it would be of no use as Trip.com would only contact Philippine Airlines again and get the same response and this would just go round in circles. I tried asking to see if there was an alternate team or number to find out more details, or to seek further advice, but the Philippine Airlines agent just hung up on me. It is SO upsetting that this how they treat their customers. I know that in general the people of Philippines are lovely and friendly, but Philippine Airlines seem to be such a poorly managed organisation that the poor service runs throughout the business. I would love for Philippine Airlines to reach out to me to help with this. It is as simple as confirming that the flight from BNE to MNL was cancelled so that we can get our money back."

We were supposed to fly from Cebu to Bangkok with a connecting flight in Manila on the 26th of April 2023. Once in Manila, our flight to Bangkok was first delayed, then cancelled. Complete chaos ensued. We had to pass through immigration once again and had to queue for 4 hours (standing! – see photo) in order to be offered an alternative flight. When it was our turn, the only available flight they had was late in the afternoon on the next day, which meant we would miss our flight back to Europe. Thus, we had to buy our own tickets for a different carrier’s morning flight in order to be in Bangkok on time. However, we were promised that we would be reimbursed. We spent the night in a shabby hotel in Manila, courtesy of Philippine Airlines, and travelled to Bangkok on the next day on that other flight. But the worst part came after our trip. We contacted them in order to be reimbursed and they asked for our names, ticket details, etc. Upon sending them that information, we never again heard from them. NEVER. No matter how many times we wrote. This was four months ago. So we're stuck and there's nothing we can do. And the absurd part is that we had purchased the additional travel insurance they were offering. In other words, Philippine Airlines deliberately chose to ignore our reimbursement request, even though we were insured against flight cancellation by them … how is this even possible? Terrible, just absolutely terrible."

LA to Manila - Once again one seat would not recline at all.  They suggested we might have to stay overnight in LA if we wanted a seat that reclined, eventually got on had to move seats from my 16 yo daughter as they bumped an employee out of business. Fourth leg: Still another seat not reclining, super stressful flights. If you pay for Business class at any price you expect the seat and entertainment to work.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Singapore,August 2023,,,,,,1.0,1.0,no,1,"  I was supposed to be on an afternoon flight to Singapore (arrival 6 pm) with a connection to Helsinki at 9.40 pm. However, yesterday morning I received an email from PAL stating that the afternoon flight has been postponed ant the new arrival time in Singapore is 9.40 pm, and doesn't leave me much chance to make my connection. However there was no mention whatsoever about the connection. So, I was trying to be proactive and called the PAL customer service (on my super expensive overseas SIM I might add) Spent 1,5 hours on the phone. I wanted to ask for another connection and was offered the 9.35 am flight to Singapore. As this meant I would have to leave my accommodation shortly after midnight and additionally wait at Singapore for 8 hours, I requested the possibility of rerouting me altogether. In the 1,5 hours I spent on the phone (roughly 1 hour of which she was repeating the phrases one moment sir, do you mind if I put you on hold sir, thank you for patiently waiting sir) the end result was that I had to take the 9.35 am flight, rearrange my transportation and wake up at midnight to get to the airport. OK, these things happen every once in a while. I would have expected at least some sort of compensation though, however nothing was offered. Not even a bottle of water. Well, next time something like this happens (should I ever fly PAL again) I'll just happily take the postponed flight and start asking questions at the transfer desk of the connecting airport (obviously having missed my connection) and let them make new arrangements at the last minute. Might be even more uncomfortable for me but at least definitely more expensive to them.  Finnair, as the issuing airline, washed their hands completely with a mere suggestion to contact PAL so I guess it could be worse. "

Next I flew with them again for my family's Manila-HK-Manila flight. A day before the trip I checked in online and got our boarding passes. On the day of our HK flight and as we checked in at NAIA T1 the ground staff said our flight was cancelled. I had to argue with them that we already got confirmed seats as we checked in online the day before. We had no idea that PAL cancelled our flight 3 hours after we checked in online. They e-mailed us at 11pm in the evening less than 12 hours from our scheduled flight. After a 20 minute wait at the check in counter they were able to check us in on our HK flight. On our flight back from HK to Manila I tried to check in online but could not find our booking. It seems PAL cancelled our flight without informing us. I contacted their Facebook Messenger agent and they said there was an error with the booking. Our ticket and scheduled flight was at 11:10am but They said our ""original"" flight was at 2:00pm was cancelled. They did not inform us about this cancellation nor the change of time so we got so confused. The agent said they will rebook us for the 11:10am flight. How can you rebook us on exactly the same flight? PAL is seriously messed up and I have decided not to fly with them for the mean time. I would rather fly with more reliable and punctual airlines."

Staff were not help on ground in person or on phone, to communicate in English was difficult, the app didn't show flights at all and even when entering them manually they would disappear again. Another big issue was when we were not able to make one flight they cancelled all our flights. And even when asking for a refund they charge a refund service fee of a ridiculous amount. Fist told refund fee was 2000+1500 per person per way and then next message was told it was 4000+1500 per person per way. they said it takes 2-3 months for the refund to be processed.

What's the point of the app? The ground staff are can't think for themselves without any empathy. Their tickets and baggage are a money grabbing scams.

I tried their Facebook chat at least 20 times and all they saying is ""Send them another email, and you will surely get a response the next morning"".

We called and emailed the airline every single day for a number of weeks, with mixed feedback. We never received our luggage back and neither could we claim our insurance due to the fact that Philippine Airlines couldn't provide us with a claim number in time.

Luckily, a domestic feeder flight was delayed so my flight to LAX was held. I was also impressed with the fact my luggage made it onto the LA flight despite having to be escorted to my flight to LAX. However, I was disappointed on several fronts. 1. At Manila, the only x-ray machine, which is required for transit passengers, wasn't working properly, and a long queue was forming. I had to demand to be given priority given my flight to LAX was imminently departing. 2. When I boarded the Manila flight, my seatback TV wasn't working. I complained and the staff eventually moved me to a better seat, but I consider this poor, given I was faced with a 13 hour flight and no entertainment.  The check-in staff at Jakarta were quite unprofessional. I checked in and then when I was through security at Jakarta, I got a WhatsApp call from the check-in employee asking my ESTA number. I then messaged her it, and it was sorted, but still, common sense suggests staff should get such basic details right during the check-in process. I was able to tell the flight would be 5 hours late, yet the check-in staff at Jakarta assured me it was only 2 and a half hours late. Overall, I will try using an alternative airline in future."

In Manila the ground team kindly changed our tickets to Caticlan airport because the next available flight to Kalibo was next day. During check in to that flight to Caticlan, we have asked to the lady at the counter if we can upgrade our ticket to business class in order to use the lounge. She said there is no business class available on the plane but she upgraded us to comfort class and told us that we can use the lounge regardless. I have paid 70usd per pax for the upgrade. When we approached to the lounge, we have been informed that comfort class passengers cannot use the lounge. Since we have already passed the security, I couldn’t go back to the counter and change back my ticket. While we were boarding to the plane, the lady at the gate saw our boarding passes and changed our seat numbers without any explanation. When we boarded, the cabin chief told us that he will check for the reason of the change. After his countless tries, the reason for the change was that as per Philippine Airlines regulations same day upgrades are not allowed, and he said we have to sit on the new seats which are not comfort class zone. After half an hour commotion, cabin chief offered us the seats, but he said he cannot not offer the services which we agreed and we finally took off. At the end of the day, we had to wait around 5 hours without any explanations for our delayed flight and then we have been charged 140 usd for a service that we did not receive.  I contacted PR customer service online, they keep stalling and stalling saying that they are investigating. It has been 20 days since I am made the claim through customer service and they still respond that they are investigating, hoping that I give up."

I bought the ticket February 2023 and since then they kept on changing my flight schedule to the point that I have no time to transfer to my connecting flight. July 2 checked in day and the American Airlines (partner) assistant told me that she cannot check me in because of the tight schedule of my connecting flight and she cannot checked in my luggage. I have to call Philippine Airlines customer agent to have it fix and they did, but now instead of arriving early to Cebu it be at a later date. I have to wait 6 hours for my flight to Manila to Cebu. Now that was just the beginning of my nightmare. On my return flight which was scheduled 8:15 am (Cebu to Manila) was cancelled and changed to 10:35 am 2 days before my actual flight on July 17. I arrived 6:00Am in Mactan airport just to hear that my flight was cancelled and they are working to have me reroute. I waited for 2 hours to have it fix. Now, instead of 2 hours layover to Manila. I have to wait for 9 hours for my Manila-LA flight which is now scheduled to 9:05pm instead of the original schedule 11:25 am. While my flight was still in mid air in LA, my connecting flight to Las Vegas via American Airlines left me because Philippine Airlines ticketing agent did not give enough time for transfer. My Manila-LA flight was 9:05pm to 7:50 pm but the aircraft was delayed in Manila due to documentation process and we arrive later around 8: 20 pm, and boarding time for American Airlines was 8:10pm and I am still at LA customs and picking up luggage that by the time I have to check in to American Airlines, I was told that my flight already departed and I have been rebooked to another airline (DELTA), now I have to walk outside again and have to look for Terminal 3 to look for Delta Airlines. I am just glad they rebooked me to Delta and made it to Las Vegas."

Philippine airlines staff and not helpful in the slightest with any query. The staff at Manila airport are also horrendous. Each person you talk to tries to handball you off to another person.

Several times during our vacation they would have delays or misrepresent them by having technical landings, only informing us days before our flight with no service or compensation of course. Cabins themselves are quite cold and uncomfortable, again not usually an issue for budget carriers but this is supposed to be a national airline. Two bright spots would be that the in flight staff really try their best and the routes from MNL to the United States are by far the cheapest available."

Aside from delays due to Manila airport congestion, the check in counter staff in Singapore Changi Airport won’t help you if you wish to take an earlier flight. They would outright tell you to go to the ticket office in downtown Singapore. It’s such a hassle, if you’re already at the airport and the check in for the earlier flight is almost closing. They didn’t even bother to take a look at my ticket. I was so frustrated that no policy for go-shows was put in place, but still in the end, I thank Amanda, one of the handling agents, for her candour because according to her, without assurances from the ticket office or anyone from Philippine Airlines, she might be liable for penalties in case they bumped me to an earlier flight for free. Sadly, my PR512 flight which was scheduled at 19.05, was delayed for almost 3 hours, without any compensation. I’m never flying Philippine Airlines from Singapore to Manila ever again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to San Francisco,June 2023,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,no,1," It's been my first time going back to the Philippines after the pandemic and I had a great time not until I had to go back to the US. My flight was scheduled at 11pm and I got to the airport at around 4pm since you'll never know how bad the traffic is and I was concerned about how long the line is at the bag drop area. At around 5pm, I had completed the carry on screening at the immigration area, so obviously next step is to head to your assigned gate. Upon reaching our gate, it surprised me a little bit because there's another screening before I can finally enter my gate (screening area was literally right next to the it). Made me think like ""okay it's fine that they are taking security seriously"" but at the same time, it's ridiculous! No structure at all. No priority lane for senior/handicap/pregnant people). Only 1 line for everyone. On top of that, when you want to use the restroom, which is literally behind your assigned gate but apparently not part of any gate, you have to ""exit your gate"". Of course, when you wanna enter the gate again, you have to go through that BS screening process. Imagine if you have medical condition that's not visible, like diabetes or bladder condition, and you had to go to the bathroom every single time. Sure you can ask for assistance but staff at NAIA terminal 1, also Philippine Airlines staff, are not approachable. Discrimination among their co-Filipinos are apparent. Staff were very friendly and considerate with foreigners. Since I was at the airport very early, I had to have water and food. Which is reasonable I think. Apparently, for Philippine Airlines, it wasn't. Since my family and I are at the gate, we were thinking, it was okay to bring in food. We also asked a staff who assisted a person in a wheelchair if it was okay to bring food ""inside the gate"" and we were told it was ""okay"". My boyfriend and I got my family food, coffee, and water but when we got back to the gate screening area we were told that drinks/liquid are not allowed. This made me furious! It's not as if drinks are at the airport airport are cheap. Employees also are implying that we toss what we just bought! Very ridiculous. Signs should have been a must. Anyway, as a work around, we went to the area where we can eat and drink (outside the ""gate""). As my boyfriend and I are finishing the food/drinks, Philippine Airlines staff were pressuring us to go to the screening area even though they see that we are still eating and trying to eat as fast as we can, threatening that if we don't cooperate, they won't let us board the plane. Staff are very rude, instead of guiding passengers about the rules and regulation of the place, they make the customers lives awful! It's 2023 and things need to change. It's very sad to see that the country's biggest airline treats it's customer this way."

Nothing bad so far. Then upon checking your bags in you'll then go through immigration where they will once again do another inspection, and in line there will be one guy in a little podium with a sign that says ""Secondary Inspection"". In the span of what seemed like less than 30 minutes I've already had to check in and give my passport three times. When going to our gate there was another check in just to get to our waiting area but it gets worse. Once we waited through that line we thought this would be a good time to grab some snacks and drinks to wait for our plane but little did we know that not only are you required to check in again to come back to the waiting area but no foods or drinks were allowed in the waiting area. I looked around to see signs and didn't find a single one about not allowing food so here we are now with purchases food unable to go back to our bags and forced to eat outside. Our solution for this was taking turns, someone would go and watch our bags while the others ate outside. It would be very nice if the bathrooms were located inside our waiting area? Her mother had to leave the waiting area, use the bathroom, and then check back in to come back to us."

After complaining to the crew, nothing was done! Considering how expensive their tickets are with the product and service they offer, never again!

They lied to us and told us that we didn't have enough time to connect, but the other 10 passengers on our flight did? The flight the following day was cancelled due to bad weather, we were rebooked the following day. Received an email when we were waiting to get picked up to go to the airport that our flight was again bumped, even though Vancouver airport was open and accepting flights. We called to ask what was happening and they kept hanging up on us. The worst customer service and communication ever. They put us up in some cheap hotel with terrible food that was inedible sent to us like we were in quarantine for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We didn't fly out until December 24th in the evening and missed our connecting flights in Vancouver and Christmas with our family. Our flights were $1,700 each one way, so they were not cheap.

It's been an infuriating two months since they cancelled my flight, and I'm still without a refund. What's worse is that even Traveloka, the booking platform I used, seems powerless to assist. This is unacceptable! When an airline cancels a flight, customers rightfully expect a swift refund process. However, my experience with Philippine Airlines has been a never-ending saga of frustration and disappointment. Not only have they failed to provide any update on my refund status, but Traveloka's attempts to advocate on my behalf have also proved futile. I demand compensation for the inconvenience, time wasted, and the lack of transparency surrounding this issue. As a customer, I deserve better treatment and accountability from an airline that I trusted to provide reliable service.

Lost our reservation when we tried to do online check-in. Had to spend an hour on the phone to get the reservation confirmed only to be missing again the next morning. They knew the flight was delayed but print the boarding pass with the outdated information. Probably so they can ignore the fact that you will be missing your connecting flight so they dont have to deal with that mess early, but later when you get to NAIA. No one apologizes. No one cares. Baggage handlers tell us this is no longer the exception but the rule with the airlines. There is no system in place to deal with delays and missed connections. Again, because no one cares. There are no proactive measures to help their customers. It's just a shrug and what are you going to do about it? Lack of effort for displaced and distressed passengers is extremely unprofessional."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Tokyo via Manila,June 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1.0,no,1,"  Our plan was to embark on a family holiday, traveling from Melbourne to Tokyo. We had flights booked from Melbourne to Tokyo (Haneda) with a three- and half-hour layover in Manila, and our hotels were all set and paid for. 1- The airline made a change to our Manila to Haneda flight, which initially didn't seem like a big deal as we still had enough time to catch our connecting flight. 2- Then, to our dismay, the airline further altered our first flight from 8:00 am to 11:00 am, causing considerable stress. It only allowed us a mere hour for the layover, which seemed quite challenging but potentially doable. 3- To our dismay, 48 hours prior to departure, they rescheduled once again, pushing our first flight from 11:00 am to 6:30 pm. This change meant we would miss our second flight entirely. I had to spend a frustrating three hours on the phone with PAL (Philippine Airlines) to reroute our journey. 4- Eventually, we agreed to a new route: Melbourne to Denpasar (operated by Qantas), Denpasar to Manila, and Manila to Tokyo. However, this decision was made a mere 48 hours before our scheduled departure. Despite the frustration, we proceeded with the check-in process for the Melbourne to Denpasar leg and prepared to leave. 5- Merely 16 hours before our flight, they changed the Denpasar to Manila departure time from 1:00 am to 6:00 am. This alteration left us unable to catch our third flight. The constant changes were causing immense frustration, especially with such short notice. 6- I had to endure yet another four-hour call with PAL's customer service to sort out the situation. They rescheduled our flights once more: Melbourne to Sydney (operated by Qantas), Sydney to Manila, and Manila to Haneda. This final change occurred less than 10 hours before our scheduled departure. 7- To compound the issue, PAL failed to issue our tickets despite confirming the new arrangement. They also neglected to call back as promised. Upon arriving at the airport to catch our Qantas flight from Melbourne to Sydney, we discovered that the tickets couldn't be issued because we had already checked in for the Melbourne to Denpasar flight. It was nearly impossible to locate PAL personnel at the Sydney airport, even with the assistance of Qantas staff. Frustrated and exhausted, we had no choice but to return home from the airport. 8- Thankfully, I received a call from a helpful Qantas representative while I was struggling to reach PAL again from home. She informed me that she had followed up with PAL in Sydney and arranged for a direct Qantas flight from Melbourne to Haneda. Finally, after a day of turmoil, we were able to board the plane. This entire experience was an absolute nightmare! The lack of management and poor customer service were beyond appalling. I'm baffled as to how they maintain a four-star airline rating. I strongly advise against booking with this airline. I'm still anxious about my return journey from Osaka with them."

I will not recommend anyone to fly with PAL until they get their operations and training right. Our transit experience at MNL to MEL was utterly unpleasant. PAL's ground staff failed to communicate what is required of transit passengers in advance and made us go around in circles, doing unnecessary processes and had a horrible surprise at the boarding gate when we were told that we need to go to another location to have our check-in bags opened up for inspection just before our flight. It is also unacceptable that some crew on PR508 flying from SIN to MNL on 8 June was sleeping on the Premium Economy seats, even thought the cabin was empty. PAL, once again changed our flight timing from MEL to MNL on 18 June and changed the A330 from the refurbished cabin to their older product with a terrible 2-2-2 configuration with no IFE on board and seats with different height. What doesn't make sense is that they allocate me and my partner to sit separately, across the aisle despite having the same booking. The business class cabin is very full and we don't have any option to even select a side by side seat. It is unacceptable for such arrangements by PAL for their premium customers and undeserving 4 star airline rating."

They dragged me and my pregnant wife around the airport until they left us in baggage claim of the domestic arrivals. Took them several hours to find it. We kept asking raising our concerns about our flight being soon. But they told me and my wiFe to sit down and wait. Finally when we got our luggage we were rushed to an shuttle bus (that stops at several places) instead of a taxi to take us directly to where we needed to go.

This was not the case in many times that flew PAL. The last straw was during my trip to SFO, there was a very disorderly security inspection done at the very entrance causing a build up in the entrance to the plane. I was not only hungry, I was tired! I was made to stand and wait at the long line of passengers being inspected (this was already done after immigration!) Everyone had to fall in line! Whether you were business, economy, senior, pwd, etc etc! There was Hoi poloi and irritating long wait to be seated. Food preparation inside plane was not well done! We were even refused to be given individual water bottles until I insisted! I think the staff was new! She had no place in business class! No offer of snacks before dinner, staff was discourteous, toilet was not clean and no toothbrushes or towels. No sparkling water, no snacks! Lousy lousy service is all I can say! I never want to ride PAL ever again. They did not control the outflow of passengers from economy, so as I was waiting to be helped with my luggage from the overhead compartment, the economy passengers started coming in! So there seemed to be no controls in place. I can go on and on. The tv screen was too far for me to control from my seat. So forget entertainment! That was a 13.5 hr flight!

Some minor knit-picking, the interactive map was not functioning for the entire flight which disappointed me and my wife's entertainment screen did not function at all. No other problems were noted. We did receive all of our luggage at Honolulu International when we arrived. PAL must work on it's on-time performance and fix some of the glitches on their aircraft in order to remain competitive. Unfortunately for PAL NAIA is probably PAL's biggest Achille's heel, being too outdated and overcrowded. Also terminals are very far apart with not transit linking any of the terminals.

No reimbursements, no apologies as the agent kept stating that he would cancel my itinerary instead of answering my questions on alternative available flights as he kept saying ""until you have a definite answer"". I ended up having to request a full cancelation and refund, so I could book an immediate international flight leaving the next day (costing me much more) and the agent has said that the refund will be completed in 90 days, after initiating the refund request.

The cabin crew helped us when we couldn't find a space in the overhead bin near our seats and informed us where they placed. Had no problems with entertainment. Flying back from Manila is a completely different story. The entertainment on MNL to LAX kept buffering, and the flight map showed multiple times that it was unavailable. For the workers, most of those on the Manila to LA flight looked like they hate their job. The check-in worker was so strict on the weight of our carry-on luggage so we had to remove some belongings, which didn't happen to us in Los Angeles. Not one cabin crew member informed us where they placed our luggage when there was no overhead bin space near our seats, so we had to wait for basically every passenger to leave so that we could find our luggage. I don't know why there was such a discrepancy between the workers in LAX vs. MNL, but the check-in and flight back was honestly the worst airport experience I've had so far."

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Vancouver,May 2023,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no,4,"  This flight is a replacement schedule for the original flight schedule that was changed three times. The original flight was supposed to head to HNL then connect to LAS via a different airline. The original schedule had at least 5 hours layover which we were going to use to meet some relatives at the airport. PAL made adjustments three times until it already affected the connecting flight schedule, which PAL did not adjust. If I hadn’t informed them about this, it would have been a disaster. So the replaced the original schedule into a completely different schedule and airports. We have to cancel meeting with my relatives. Not the first time this happened. Similarly, The outbound flight 10 days ago was also replaced with a different flight schedule and plane. Also noticed food is not as great as what it was a decade ago. We are seriously thinking we won’t fly PAL again in the future unless they improve."

My biggest issue the our missing baggage of which I am pleased to report that our remaining luggage was just delivered today 23 May 2023 at approximately 12:30pm Manila time to our hotel in Eastwood City, Quezon City, Philippines. All three pieces were delivered intact by the courier contracted by Philippine Airline. I wish to thank PAL for their hard efforts in retrieving our missing luggage. I am pleased with PAL's efforts and with their ground and cabin service I am happy to say I will fly them again. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Manila,May 2023,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,no,6,"  Flight was delayed approximately 3.5hrs taking off Honolulu at 3pm instead of 1135am. The ground staff at PAL provided free refreshments, a nice touch. Once airborne, the flight was very smooth. As far as inflight service, I couldn't ask for better airline service. The cabin crew was professional, courteous, and attentive, even passing out menus in economy which I haven't seen in years. Hot towels were passed out before landing, again a nice touch. After a smooth and wonderful flight, what spoiled everything was that not all of our luggage was delivered. The baggage personnel stated that my son's baggage 2 pieces, and my wife's baggage 1 piece was pulled and not loaded on our aircraft due to possible weight issues which I don't believe, as none of this was ever brought to my attention when we checked in our luggage. My wife and son completed the paperwork for the missing luggage and for compensation. The baggage personnel stated they would load the baggage on the next day's PR 101 and deliver to our hotel. The flight is delayed even more, not landing in Manila until approximately 9pm tonight. I hope our missing luggage will be delivered, my son had to buy clothes since none of his luggage was delivered. As much as I would like to give PAL a 5star rating because of the wonderful inflight service, this luggage issue prevents me from doing this. The delay I can tolerate, but the luggage issue is inexcusable . How PAL handles this luggage issue will determine if I fly them again. I will be extremely furious if this issue is not resolved."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Tokyo via Manila,April 2023,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,1,"  Worst airline you can ever fly. The flight connected via Manila, which when I booked had a very reasonable 2hr transfer. After checked in, I received an email “SIMPLE RE-ACCOMODATION“ advising that 2hrs was now 24+ hours with no apology or explanation. They offered me to access to their transfer lounge, which was a horrifying basement, I asked about hotels but we are not allowed out of the airport and we are not allowed to go to other terminals. We had to wait in the transfer lounge of Manila airport terminal 2. They have one lounge at the terminal 2 which is allowed only business class passengers. This was a very dilapidated terminal, lounge is very dirty, smelly and no facilities, not enough seating, stores are kiosks, which sell some sketchy looking products, and sometimes cash only and sometimes closed. Very little variety, they don’t even allow you to go to shops alone. Wifi is only for 3 hours per day. I’ve met many people who have faced the same issues. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with the way that Philippine Airlines (PAL) handled the situation. As a customer, I expect to be treated fairly and with respect, and unfortunately, that was not the case with this airline. I would not recommend flying with them epecially when you have a connecting flight."

Booked all my legs on the Philipines Airlines website. On arrival in Manila was put on a bus for 20 minutes waiting and then when we got to international terminal told to run.  As going through the terminal told to run to gate - then get there and told not boarding yet! Compulsory masks as they claim for health purposes, but then they allocated seats in one block of an empty plane! Surely for health reasons would be better to spread us out!! Avoid Manila and this airline at all cost!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manilla to Singapore ,May 2023,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,2.0,1.0,no,1, Worst experience. They kept changing the aircraft so your preselected seats will be forfeited. My return flight was also canceled less than 24 hrs before the flight time. The airline only offered me hotel and a new flight next morning but I couldn't take it as I have work to do. The refund can be submitted but there's no guarantee on the amount and may take up to 3-6 months to process. I ended up having to buy a new ticket last minute which was super expensive. What a bad experience.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Los Angeles to Manila,March 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,1,"  I had purchased a business class ticket with high expectations, only to be extremely disappointed and frustrated throughout the entire journey. The 14-hour flight from Los Angeles to Manila was extremely uncomfortable due to the absence of remote controls on our seats, which meant we couldn't even watch any movies or programs during the flight. Despite their acknowledgment of the defect, the compensation offered by the airline of only 5,000 bonus miles each was not enough to make up for the inconvenience caused during our honeymoon trip. Unfortunately, the issues didn't end there. We experienced serious deficiencies in service by the check-in counter personnel, gate agents, flight attendants, their teamwork, and the in-flight facilities. It was an unpleasant, frustrating, and even traumatic experience for us. The check-in personnel at LAX Los Angeles Airport were not professional and their hysterical attitude made us feel unwelcome. We were even forced to purchase tickets without regard to the date because the boarding time was near, and her words were threatening. Furthermore, the baggage manager demanded an excessive baggage fee for my 5'5"" surfboard that we were already permitted to check-in during our previous flight from the US to Hong Kong. To make matters worse, my surfboard was broken upon arrival in Hong Kong. Additionally, the remote control for our seats was broken, and we weren't even informed until after we asked for their email address and emailed them. The flight attendants even stepped on my feet when preparing food, which was both painful and unprofessional. The experience traumatized us, and it was very disappointing to not have received a response from the customer service center for almost a month. It was a nightmare from start to finish and made our honeymoon extremely unpleasant. As a paying customer who bought a business class ticket, I expected better service from the airline. However, the poor quality of service and lack of accountability left me feeling angry and frustrated."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,New York to Bangkok via Manila,May 2023,,,,,,,1.0,no,1,"  The worst airline ever. First, they rescheduled my flight which will be 3 hours later than the original time. It was acceptable. But when I did the online check-in, I realized they had downgraded my seat from premium economy to economy class. So I gave them a call. The customer service just informed me that the transit time of the rescheduled flight is too short, which is 1.3 hours. I will definitely miss the connecting flight.  Why did they provide this flight for me in the first place? If I did not call, then I would have missed the flight and been stuck at their airport for a day! As a result, I have to book another flight from another airline which is twice more expensive than the usual fee since I booked it last minute. So please don't ever fly with them. It's a waste of money and time."

One cancellation resulted in a three day delay in which they told us this is our problem as the notice was more than 24 hours. They have more than enough staff to support the clientele but all were sitting on their phones doing everything in their power to ignore us. We were ignored at every turn and offered nothing. The flight itself and the cabin crew were fine, provided you can leave when advertised, but this is never the case it seems. I feel sorry for the cabin crew as they deal with upset customers all the time because of the lack of organisation, customer service and care from the ground staff. I cannot begin to describe how strongly I would avoid this airline. We decided on a different provider for their domestic travels. Every worker from other companies seemed to roll their eyes at the mentioning of our situation and present the idea that this should be expected."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Doha,April 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,2.0,no,1,"  Shocking experience in every aspect. The cabin was freezing throughout the flight, the food was far below what to expect from a 4-star airline. There were so few toilets that there was always a ten minute wait in line (so not in your seat). Also wasn't aware that airlines actually exist who do long haul flights - ours was 10 hours - without any in-flight entertainment whatsoever, there weren't even screens. Since my girlfriend felt unwell, I switched seats to give her a chance to lay down since there were several empty seats but was immediately told by the flight crew that there was an extra charge for the seat I was in. When I said I'd be willing to pay that charge, they said that this had to be arranged beforehand. And it wasn't a seat in a different class or anything, just a different row in Economy. Nothing short of a terrible customer experience to say the least. Wifi connectivity was obviously non-existent. To top this off, we arrived 4,5 hours late do our destination compared to the scheduled flight we booked. We were told beforehand that we were gonna be three hours and 45 minutes late, but they didn't even managed to keep that schedule."

Suddenly everyone got shock that the flight was move to 11:00 in the evening. Boarding time the plane is still no where to be found. 10:24 the plane arrived but still need to offload the passenger. So as expected flight again was delayed to 11:50 pm. Now its 11:15 still the cabin crew are still outside. What a disappointment. This is no justice to the fare we paid. So bad.

Yes, rain, in a country that has a monsoon season. They didn't help with our connection that we ended up missing and had to purchase another flight. They didn't help us get a hotel for the night. They didn't get us transfers or food. Sure, they were friendly but that made up for nothing. We're 2000 USD out of pocket because of a rain storm. If you're planning on flying with them give yourself a buffer of a free days because you will probably get cancelled if there's even a cloud in the sky"

First flight was Brisbane to Manila then the second being Boracay to Clarke. The Brisbane to Manila really surprised me. Excellent service, good food, entertainment, and comfortable seats in economy. It did look like business class had flat beds even though seat guru said they were only recliners. I will certainly fly them again."

As a result I was told I could not accompany my family on our flight to Busunaga and I had to purchase a very expensive one ticket through Cebu to reach them. The latest response from PAL was to provide two more email addresses to send a copy of my ID… I have already sent my ID, the reservation number, and my request to the four other email addresses I was given. Over the phone I was told it would be corrected and it never was then I was told I need to go back to the Ticket Office to get it corrected, I did and they referred me to another email address. I was told it could be taken care at the ticket counter since all other I of matched such the dob, address, payment info, and the fact that I am traveling with my family on the same ticket, but they refused to fix it at the counter and referred me back to customer service on the phone.

Second, when I opened my headset package one headphone drop and of course it’s not working. The outlet where we need to plug the headset there’s a scotch tape around the armchair and I need to push the cable the whole time for me to hear the sound. I wonder how many headsets were broken that time. We were also told our chair can’t be reclined, one of our TV screens was not working. Food is not as great as before. Trays can’t pull closed to us. For PR116 flight back to Vancouver, same issues. Toilet sink is not draining properly. As a Filipino, it’s so embarrassing if tourists will see these issues.

Flight attendants are very hospitable and willing to help. For the negatives, crowded leg space for Economy Class for their DXB-MNL flights. They are using the same crowded aircraft for many years and not one ounce of this have improved. I’m stuck with the same airline over and over again because it’s my employer who chooses the flight and not me. Not only the leg spaces are crowded, the in-flight entertainment is inconvenient. They have, but you have to download an app for it on your mobile and connect to the aircraft wifi. While that’s not a bad idea, this consumes battery and seats don’t have charging slots. It feels like they never considered improving their Middle East flights since most passengers are Filipino Expatriates but of course, their flights going to countries such asUS, Canada, UK, Australia are way better - better leg space and actual screens for in-flight entertainment. Not to mention, all of my flights to Dubai from Manila are late (1-2 hours delayed)."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Manila,March 2023,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,2.0,no,2," By far one of the worst airlines I have taken so far. First, it took so long to check in my baggage. The line was long and a lot of passengers brought overweight baggage. Most passengers do not want to pay extra for the excess baggage so they had to rearrange the baggage. Why don't these passengers do this before checking in? Ground service staff showed patience to me. On the flight, I was dissatisfied with the seat and in flight food. I tried to get some rest on this 8 hour flight but these tight seats were punishing me. The food was  bland and pathetic. I had a few bites and did not finish the whole meal. The flight attendants were attentive, yet I can only give a pass on their service."

The flight was delayed 3 times; there was no vegetarian or fish meal available in any of the flight, and it was not possible to pre-order the menu online. No sparkling wine ""because unfortunately it finished"" - so i only had a starter on BKK-MNL leg and no food on MNL-POM leg. The lounge in Bangkok had terrible food (how on earth one can find such food in Thailand?) - super fat udon noodles, rice and some fried snacks. The lounge in Manila food is not great either but better than the lounge they use in Bangkok. Nice dumplings. No in flight entertainment nor working internet on BKK-Manila flight."

They can neither send an official letter with a response, nor say the application number for a complaint or request. A month before departure, I called several times and clarified information on transporting animals on a specific flight - they confirmed the transportation of the animal and told me how to proceed (send them documents for exporting the animal three days before departure). I bought a ticket and three days before departure, I sent them all the documents and called to find out the status of the reservation. Support told me in surprise, why did I get the idea that you can fly with an animal. I talked with support all evening, they even listened to my calls to them, before buying a ticket, and confirmed that yes, it was their mistake, and that it was really impossible to bring an animal. And why another employee said so, they don’t know. They don’t help with a full refund, they refer to the fact that it was my mistake. When asked to listen to those calls, they answer that they suddenly cannot do this, and they cannot send the recordings to me either. Lost time, money, nerves and strength. The most terrible airline."

I called their customer service and talked to them for about an hour. I said, this airline have the nerve to change flight 5 days after my original booking. They told me no aircraft available to depart on my scheduled departure. Instead, they book me to Korean Air and Philippine Airline connecting flight to Manila if I want to leave on my original departure date.  I paid for non-stop flight which is expensive, but I got stop over in Incheon for 3 hours. I wish other airlines from US will fly direct to Manila."

Philippine Airlines was the only non-stop option that we could find. The flights and arrival/departure times were within reason. Airline personnel and their service was always very good. We traveled on a B777-300, which was fine, but the business cabin was original. The entertainment system appeared to have CRT monitors built into the seats. They worked about as well as 20 year-old CRT screens - not well. Movie/TV/Music selections were poor. There was no lack of space. Not compartmentalized. The seats were not lay-flat. There was no stowage for blanket/pillow apart from your lap or the floor in front of you. One was viewing the monitor from a distance of about 4-5 feet. Generally, it was not comfortable, or what i would expect in 2023. The food would have been Ok for Premium Economy. The wine was generic and Ok for no better than Economy. The lounges at SFO and Manila were disappointing. "

On January 10, we received the message that our flight VNZ38N was rescheduled. In this message from Philippines Airlines says that if you do not want to accept this you can contact the service. I contacted them through What's App on January 26 and the support team assisted me on my request. I specifically asked if I can cancel the tickets for my husband and for me and get a full refund. He checked twice and confirmed that we would be refunded the full amount for both flights. On 26 January, I then received an email from Philippines Airlines for my husband and me, that I should contact the service again, because more information is needed from us. I contacted the service again via What's App on Feb 2. I had to explain everything from the beginning again and was in chat for over two and a half hours! I explained that the service advisor confirmed to me on 26/01 that the full amount for both flights will be refunded and I showed the screenshot with this confirmation. They unfortunately could not help me at all. 150 minutes in the chat took me a lot of time and nerves and nothing came out of it! I filed a complaint on February 1 for my husband and for me at [email protected] with our reference numbers. On February 2, a service representative called me from +1800-435-9725. He said that he can´t provide me the full name, we talked on the phone for 20 minutes. He got approval by his manager to refund our full amount as confirmed already by Sergio on Jan 26th in What's App Chat... He understood that based on Sergio's confirmation, we cancelled the two flight tickets through Philippines Airlines and booked a new flight with another airline, because there was no flight from Philippine Airlines which fits in our time schedule with the other flights. We did this based on the statement that we would be refunded the full amount for these two flights! He therefore spoke with his manager and received clearance for the full refund to us. He told me that he will give this info to the back office and that back office will then email me the confirmation for the full refund for the canceled tickets. To date I have not received an email! Now that I've spoken to three service people from Philippine Airlines, wrote several times e-mails, invested so much time and have to start all over again, I'm very upset"

What a huge mistake. The flight connected via Manila, which when I booked had a very reasonable 2hr transfer. After booking I received an email advising that 2hrs was now 6+ hours with no apology or explanation. On arrival in Manila, we went to the transfer desk, and were met with shrugs and total apathy regarding the delay. We were offered access to their transfer lounge, which was a horrifying basement, we asked about hotels but are not allowed out of the airport. We had to wait in the departures area of Manila airport, terminal 2. This was a very dilapidated terminal, very dirty and no facilities, stores are kiosks, which sell some sketchy looking products, and sometimes cash only and sometimes closed. Very little variety. We were then asked to head downstairs to identify our already checked baggage? After this we were re screened again into the boarding gate. When we finally boarded the flight to Melbourne, we were greeted by unfriendly cabin staff. No explanation for the delay . I asked if there was any option that did not include meat resulted in the cabin crew telling me the options are pork or fish. No further offers of beverages followed the initial service. When we landed, the cabin crew had to awkwardly push aside premium economy passengers to allow business passengers to disembark first. Never again. "

Within days they had changed our stopover of a few hours in Manila to overnight. They had they audacity to call it a “simple re-accommodation”. Having to stay overnight in Manila was not simple or pleasant. At check in in Sydney the staff were rude when they told us we need a Manila ecovid certificate. No help was provided.  Now we find our return leg is similarly affected with a 7 hour stopover (was 2 hours) in the awful Manila airport during the hours of 1935 to 0330.

We flew 4 sectors with PAL and all were significantly delayed. Transit in Manila was an absolute nightmare. Straight off our plane those also transiting were ushered into a corridor and ushered plastic chairs. No communication!  More than an hour later, we were given water. Then transit passengers were asked to move to the transfer desk.  After standing in a line for almost 30 minutes, our passports were taken and we were moved to another room – where we waited for another hour.  Next, we were moved into another line and our hand luggage was scanned and taken to small room we had to identify our luggage which was opened and tested (for what?).  Then ushered into a bus and taken to the next terminal.  Our baggage was scanned again upon leaving the bus and then we found the gate – our hand luggage was scanned again and all our documents were checked once more where the worker was meticulously writing down (by hand) passport and ESTA numbers and taking photos with his phone of every single document! 3 days before our flight home, we received emails saying our LAX-Manila flight was going to be delayed significantly, meaning we would miss our connecting flight to Sydney. After an ordeal trying to get someone on the phone or via chat and more than 3 hours on messenger, the best PAL could offer us was leaving on a flight from LAX a day earlier, a 28 layover in Manila and arriving home in Sydney 5 hours later. That was the best they could do. They did provide hotel accommodation and food vouchers however but to some no name hotel 30 minutes drive away. We were out of pocket with a non refundable night of accom we lost in LA, car hire and needing to pay for another night of dog boarding at home. The flight from LAX to Manila was a nightmare. TV remote was broken  Reading light was broken - The lie flat bed kept hitting the floor. On arrival to Manila, only 4 out of 5 bags had arrived. The staff seemed very meh about the whole thing - uncaring and unsympathetic and didn't seem to know what to do when questioned. They were unfriendly and unhelpful and their solution was for us to fill in a form, that’s about it! About a week later, nothing from them about our bag - they just don't care! Needless to say, the trauma, the stress, the worry endured at the hands of PAL was horrendous. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cebu to Bangkok via Manila,January 2023,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,no,5,"  The focus of my review at this time is on their Mabuhay Miles frequent flyer program. I usually take a domestic flight which will connect to Manila or Cebu for an international flight, all via PAL. This saves me from trouble in case I would miss my connection. From experience, they would rebook me to the next flight for free, if there are problems with the connection. And that is okay. But accommodation and food aren't included, though that's fine by me. With so many flights, I became a frequent flyer and their program is useful in terms of extra baggage allowance and priority tag, priority boarding, and lounge access. But that's it, they don't care much about frequent flyers in other aspects, especially redemption. If you redeem a one-way international flight ticket, expect that your hard earned miles are to be practically useless, because you will still pay a huge amount. Even if you redeem a round trip ticket, you will still pay hefty airline charges because apparently, the miles are only for the base fare. I've been so used to flying with SQ where I only pay the very minimal $10 airport tax upon miles redemption, even for a oneway MNL-SIN ticket. So I find PAL's redemption rules weird and a money grab. Then there's the problem with redemption nominees that can be easily done online  with other airlines like SQ, but not PAL. It's like 1995, you need visit their ticket office or call their hotlines if you want to redeem for other people. They would have you wait for 2 to 3 hours at their ticket office (worst experience in their ticket office in Alabang), then charge you a rush fee for redemption made less than 10 days from the intended flight. From the provinces in P.I., I now take an extra day for layover in Manila just to fly with other airlines because PAL is getting ridiculous. If their frequent flyer program doesn't change, then good bye."

We asked her that if really no seat available for isle and center, she said no more and we need to sit separately both in the isle. She seven said that it’s a full flight.

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,Sydney to Manila,December 2022,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no,1,"  Philippine Airlines have the sheer arrogance of placing a Business Class passenger into a broken seat that will never turn into anything comfortable to sleep on. Worst still, I thought the seat was just uncomfortable and that was the way it was supposed to be. After 2 hours of struggling to get comfortable, I gave up sliding down the seat and it was only then I noticed the issue. Earlier in the flight, I was having a chat with one of the stewardesses and she said something about broken seats. I thought I mis-heard her and dismissed it. After letting a steward know, he got a box for the seat to prop up on. Far too late by then. Damage was done, the other passengers' children had had their sleep and there was no letting up on their noise from there on out. I'm glad I had Neurofen on hand for the headache. Why wasn't I told from the start about this? Was it the case that I wasn't going to notice or not care? Better not to alert the other passengers of the failure either else they might have something to say in social media? Towards the end of the flight, another seat failed and then my partner lets me know she can't place any weight on her chair without it collapsing. Word of advice to Philippine Airline ""Business Class"" passengers. Don't assume by paying $1000s extra that your trip is going to be anywhere near ""Business Class"". The photo of the damaged section of lighting is a bonus. I tried to complain to the airline but that was ignored."

Flight delayed 6 times then cancelled. Flight rebooked by airline five days after our scheduled departure with no notice. Missed connections so had to stay in Manila. Then the following day the flight was cancelled, and abandoned by airline for 2 days. Spoke to agents at 3 terminals in Manila. Called the 1-800 customer service number over 10 times. Texted and DM’d the airline, no one to help with hotels, rebooking, meal vouchers. The customer service reps told us to just go outside. I guess they just wanted us to sleep on the streets of Manila. No response to multiple requests for help. The flight was good, but everything to do with customer service outside the flight has been a nightmare. Strongly suggest international travelers avoid this airline. Terrible experience."

My flight on 6-Jan PR310 from Manila to Hong Kong was delayed. Ground operations is poorly managed with little to no information provided to customers. No one had any credible information.

I don’t recommend this airline until they do a significant revamp of their operations.

Before were coffee & cupcake but now just a small pack of peas & water which are not ideal for early morning flight/breakfast. On positive note, if you have connection but on a different ticket the ground staffs can connect your ticket along with luggage which saves you time in Manila.

I paid for a business class seat and got an old plane that had coach level hardware and my seat was broken and didn’t recline and they tried to get me to sit there and call later for some accommodation. They moved another passenger (probably a free upgrade) so they could give me a reclining seat, but the seats were still the old and uncomfortable kind. The entertainment equipment was not working either. Horrible experience for a business class price."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Business Class,Port Moresby to Jakarta via Manila,December 2022,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,5.0,yes,9,"  I got onboard this Airlines for the first time with very low expectations due to significantly more negative than positive online reviews. In the end, this turned out to be a pleasant surprise since my experience has shown nothing but flawless service from PR. Onboard crew service was efficient and fast on both legs POM- MNL and MNL -CGK (sometimes a bit too eager to get rid of your empty plates). Crew attitude has always been courteous and sincere. A321neo with the new business suite configuration (POM-MNL) provides a great space and comfort for resting, although I'm not so sure about the blue cloth material choice for the seating that in my opinion only makes the ambiance look more tired than it should have been. However, the same compliment can not be given to the A321ceo serving MNL-CGK with the business class seats that would send you straight back to year 1995 : there is only one adjustment button for reclining and zero IFE for more than 4-hrs flight. Last time I checked I was not boarding a low cost airlines! Meals and drinks are great and sufficient options were given for the distance of flight. Boarding was fast and efficient on both legs, with business class priority lane properly executed. Mabuhay lounge in T2 Manila provides great choice for foods, service is equally excellent (could do with more ""lazy chairs"" for long layovers). There is a dedicated bartender manning the cocktail bar. Room for improvement is the rather chaotic check in at POM without any clear priority lane given to business class. Having said that, a local supervisor noticed that I was travelling without checked luggage and immediately sent me to the front of the queue for immediate boarding pass issuance (good proactive attitude). With so many negative criticisms written about PR, I was mentally ready to look for mistakes, however I can safely report that it looks like serious improvements have been made by the management to significantly up their game. Flights on both legs actually arrived earlier than scheduled, however, this advantage was nullified at NAIA T2 when the aircraft was forced to wait 10-15 minutes prior to parking at the gate only because the aircraft marshal on the ground was not ready to guide the plane to its final parking position."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dumaguete to Ho Chi Minh,December 2022,2.0,,,,,1.0,1.0,no,1,"  From start to (almost) finish this has by far been the worst airline experience I have ever had. During our first double flight they forgot to transfer our bags during our transit. Result is that we had to wait additional days for our bags to arrive. I guess this can happen to everyone, so far so good. Now during our return flight things are even worse. They just decided one week before our flight to put the aircraft to maintenance and cancel the flight, putting us to different flights with a huge layover without any help or compensation. Their customer service is friendly, but totally garbage. I've requested via phone at first to change to flights. Not possible. Then I had to do the suggestion myself to provide hotel accommodation. They were going to process the request and I could hear back in 2 days. Then they just decided to take out the telephone lines as right now they're unreachable by phone via any of their numbers. Tried to contact them through various different hotels. Not possible. Only live chat is possible. You first have to provide a lot of information, then youre put on hold, they request all information again for ""security"". They respond and if you don't respond back in 3 mins after their response they just cancel out the conversation and you can start from scratch. Obviously not doable on holiday. Also, of course 7 days after the request, no information at all about the hotel request or any other ways of compensation. Our return flight is tomorrow. I cant contact them by phone. Hotel request is still pending and I don't expect them to handle it before tomorrow. Our flight was a good connection of 6h, now it takes 18h total. As long as everything goes fine I bet they are fine. If you run into any issues, prepare for the absolute worst. Will never fly with them again."

✅ Trip Verified ,A321 / A330,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Melbourne via Manila,October 2022,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,3.0,no,4,"  Pricewise this is the cheapest airline on this route. But a 6 hour longer detour. Flights overall were OK, nothing special. Food and service on both flights so so. Very limited choice and not very tasty. Staff not very attentive, however on this point I must say that wearing these facemasks does not contribute. All by all nothing special and in our view an airline at the lower end of the spectrum. Pretty good seat and plenty of leg room on the A321. In the A330 the inflatable cushion of the seat was not working and one of us had to sit on the metal frame. Maintenance staff could not solve the issue, cabin staff finally offered a pillow. Not very comfortable on a night flight. Lying flat (lie flat seat) it was pretty OK. The transfer on NAIA was an absolute disaster. It had a major impact on the overall experience hence our overall view on PAL. We had 3 hours to transfer, and it took us 2 ¾ hour. Ground staff is keeping themselves busy with inexplicable activities, leaving a queue of hundreds of passengers who had to crawl through a very small space, in the dark. First, one had to obtain a small stamp on the boarding pass (for what reason unclear, nothing was additionally checked) after that the cabin luggage had to be scanned again (was already scanned in SIN), suitcases had to be picked out and opened for another check (drugs?) with a cotton wool pad but without putting it in an analyser. Afterwards the suitcases were loaded. Finally at the gate the cabin luggage was scanned again. The experience on NAIA was absolutely stressful, to put it mild. The final question is: would we fly PAL again? First reaction: no, not likely."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Manila,April 2022,,,,,,,3.0,no,1,"  Over the last 10 years my husband and/or me have flown PAL roundtrip from LAX to Manila about 20 times. Flights are generally good, mostly on time, great crew, lousy food. However, their website and booking/refund policies are the worst. Almost every time we fly, their website has a problem with my credit card, then we have to spend at least an hour to call them, find the reservation, verify everything, then pay over the phone. This week I tried to book a flight, credit card rejected 4 times (Southwest Airlines VISA card with $35K credit limit that I charge everything to without issues), called, and by time we got through all the preliminary stuff the low rate I had online was gone. So we had to choose between changing my wife's family time by a day, or pay a higher fare. I have fought with customer service repeatedly over these issues to no avail. The last time this happened the customer service agent said this is a known problem and they are working on it. Really? For 9 years? I had to cancel a flight during COVID, waited 5 months for refund. Then they never fully refunded the extra charge for a good seat. BTW, now all of their aisle seats are a $20 surcharge. I have had cases where I tried to book the flight online, credit card rejected, I call, the first person finds the reservation and confirms everything, then I get transferred to another person who has to confirm everything again, then takes my credit card info and processes it, then transferred to a 3rd person who has to confirm everything again and does the seat assignments. On any other airline you can do this online in 10 minutes or less, no problem. Maybe the extra customer service expense is part of why they're in bankruptcy. Bottom line, flights are OK, booking a flight is painful, and the only reason we fly PAL is they are the only airline with direct flights from LA to Manila. If you plan to fly PAL, plan on the time the time you save by flying direct to be wasted on the phone. Watch your blood pressure!"

They will cancel and reschedule your flight with the reason of “changes in operational system” 2 days before your flight just through email notification, will not compensate you for such inconvenience but they are easy to charge you for changes on seat and request to reschedule your flight. They do not trust the security that you go through prior to reaching the main boarding gate they will make you go through another pat down security while waiting for your boarding. Two hrs before the flight this security check will happen and you are not allowed to bring drinks in flight at all and even after going through security, If you decided to go to the bathroom after the boarding gate security check you are you will have to get scan again and patted down again. I ask the reason for another security the only answer they give is you are in the Philippines and because its a direct flight which is not a logical reason. In short be ready to get dehydrated and develop some bladder issue when your flying Philippine airlines. if you want to avoid the hassle of their illogical security system and untrustworthy flight schedule i say do not book Philippines airlines for your trip to and from the Philippines."

Finally was able to book my seat as well as my elderly parents at 1am and when I woke up the next morning, not only was the flight cancelled but the seats that been booked were taken. Upon calling another service agent, I was told that my seats as well as my parents' seats were given away. It took another 3 hours to solve this issue. My flight was rebooked for the next day at the same time so again I attempted to check in online only to find out after several attempts that I cannot check in online because my parents' require special services. No where on their website did it state this, the only message that kept popping up when trying to check in said ""Error. Unable to check in"" without stating what the error was. A quick google search is how I found out that i would need to check in at the airport. 0/10 would not book with this airline again. Their online booking system is not user friendly and so difficult to navigate, and their service agents on the phone have no idea what their talking about when assisting their customers.

They gave us much later flights than we had originally booked. They sent the new flight times by email without any consultation or my permission. Subsequently we had much longer connecting times and one flight ended up at 2.40 am. One other flight change would have got us into Manila after our connection had already taken off. Had to go into ticket office twice to understand what was going on. In short, I would not have bought the tickets if I had known we had to fly at those times."

Due to my bad experience in the past with PAL I have been taking KAL, JAL etc. This time being post Covid I decided to go with PAL being familiar with Covid rules in PI. I also wanted to find out if the airline has changed thru the years in customer service. To my surprise it did not, the flight attendants were not polite bordering to being rude. I have to go to the galley to get a glass of water or drink. The attendants almost throw the food tray at your table with out any concern (repeatedly}. I have this weird feeling as if they don't like their job or you are just a nobody because you are in economy class. They seem to answer your questions in disgust that I refrain from asking them any question (I am a polite person especially to service personnel). They (attendants) congregate at the galleys talking about personal life half the time which reminds me of the SM sales people in Manila. They do not pick up things people drop at the aisle which makes the plane look trashy. Lastly, they do not clean or maintain the toilets - very disgusting. Out of the whole crew I only find 1 or 2 that is amiable or polite. This review is for people thinking of flying PAL in the future only because PAL management do not read reviews or customer complaints as they do in the West."

It was such an impossible situation for me and when I told them I was given bassinet when I was travelling from Melbourne to Philippines with Philippines airlines on 27th July then ground staff said I dont have it on this craft (which is strange) but she can arrange If I am willing to upgrade my seat. I said its not fair but for the safety of my kids I will pay them. I think she got offended and said she cant upgrade my seat and after all this I was feeling so helpless. And then I realised they were already having bassinet on the aircraft and also there were few vacant seats as well. But they just did not want to help as I refused to upgrade my seat initially. I felt so humiliated. This was the worst feeling and I will never be able to forget this nightmare.

I am a 74 year old senior and a post stroke patient with slight immobility on my left half, which require assistance. Our trip from Dubai to Philippines was ok, but the trip back to Dubai from Manila was very frustrating, which started off very badly at how our check-in was handled by the staff on the ground. We had to literally beg for assistance and consideration at the staff at the check-in counter. The customer service at the check-in desk is shockingly unhelpful and inconsiderate. To think that our traveling party consisted of a person with disability (myself), a toddler and one abled-person (my daughter) to take care of us at check-in, etc. And with luggage. So imagine how challenging our situation is. It is very unfortunate as we rarely use PAL for traveling and when we did, we had to encounter such level of service from the staff on the ground at the check in counter. I would have thought that given the set back the airlines face, this pandemic, they'd take excellent care of their customers well, but this was not the case with PAL, sadly quite the opposite. We would never experience such treatment with Emirates Airlines."

If you need to connect flights, make sure that you book a flexible or refundable ticket because PAL is never on time. Our flight from Manila to Tagbilaran was delayed by 2 hours, and the same on the return sector. We have connecting international flights which are in a different terminal, so surely we’ll be missing them considering the traffic in Manila no matter you’re only going to the terminal next door. Take a good look at your operations, when you cancel/reschedule a flight there are tons of inconveniences to us customers, ie. Car rental extensions, pick up schedule changes, time management of people that are dropping us off, hotel checkout time plus missing our connecting flights more importantly. Flying with PAL is like playing the Russian Roulette."

Seats are uncomfortable after a few hours especially when you are 6 foot plus like myself. Food was borderline comparable to just about any experience you've had in your life when you wish you didn't eat something but I believe just about all airlines serve bad meals.  My first major complaint with Philippine Airlines is the cost to check bags. The two bags I checked from LA to Manila were free. Checking the same two bags plus the two my wife had resulted in a 200 dollar fee for the relatively short flight from MNL to Dumaguete. That domestic flight wasn't even half full so not sure other than the obvious greediness explanation why Philippine Airlines charges this much to check bags. My other main complaint is I had also booked a one way ticket to Bangkok from Manila. As the date for that flight was getting close to arriving, my wife's mother became seriously ill and was hospitalized. This event made it impossible to make that flight to Bangkok. So I contacted Philippines Airline to request a refund since I don't know when my wife's mother will recover and we could visit Thailand as originally planned. A one way ticket from Manila was 130 dollars but Philippines Airline adds 50 dollars in fees just to book the ticket. The amount they charge for refunding the same ticket is 150 dollars. Not to mention the hoops you have to jump through with their request hub submission process and the ridiculous 25 to 30 minutes you have to spend on hold when they make you contact them by phone to explain the same exact details provided inside the written request. I'm not sure how these airlines are able to stay in business but one thing is very apparent, customer satisfaction isn't any type of priority or concern. It's a sad situation because the airlines in general and Philippines airline in particular seem to have way more interest in figuring out ways to gouge their customers every way possible than to follow practices that might make them happy."

The monitor in seat 68B would randomly shut off and the headphone jack was broken, this is very disappointing especially on a long flight; I had the same problem years ago on their plane too, why can't they fix this?! When returning on September 25th PR116 my selected seat was changed, I was told there was nothing they could do; why can't I have the window seat I originally booked or similar? The airport in Manila makes no sense, why do I have to pass by 3 metal detectors and show my boarding pass 4 times; this is so redundant. Additionally, when getting my luggage in Vancouver I waited for nearly an hour without seeing my luggage at the carrousel - apparently, they took off about 30 pieces of luggage and stacked it beside the carousel, why?"

Do not use this airline, especially if you are on a budget or need to complete a self-transfer in Singapore. They do not offer an early check in, and so you will be required to carry around all your bags as you wait for their check in desk to open. The staff give conflicting information, online staff promise you can check in any time, but at the desk some staff say three hours and others say four. The rest area is only available after you check in, so if you have a long layover you will be required to stay awake at the airport (as Singapore doesn’t now allow you to sleep in a waiting area). Absolutely terrible experience, this was my first and most certainly my last time using Philippine Airlines. I’d rather spend more money to avoid using them again"

My wife and I flew via Manila to Dubai and then Tel Aviv. We planned to visit Manila during the 20 hour stopover. Staff members at the Philippine Airlines Sydney office had confirmed over the phone that this should not be an issue. We applied for the One Health Pass Online and received a QR code. When we got to Manila we were told that we were not allowed to leave the airport due to being transit passengers without any further explanation. We got detained in a room without food and natural light for 16 hours. The next day our flight to Dubai was delayed by more than one hour and we nearly missed our connecting flight to Tel Aviv. Our luggage was lost and it took Philippine Airlines three days to get it back to us. One the way back we had a 10 hour stopover in Manila. Thirty minutes before boarding we were told that we to check in our luggage again. We were taken to a room with heaps of luggage and had to give our luggage to security staff for another check. Due to this the flight was delayed by 45 minutes.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Los Angeles via Manila,August 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no,1,"  Horrible experience. Flights delayed 6 hours from original time causing a missed connection. Airline call centre staff refusing to recognise the inconvenience and as such, refusing to assist with a change of booking. My ticket cancelled days before my flight for no reason – airline staff trying to blame booking agent, however, confirmed with the agent it was in fact the airline. Facebook messenger staff telling me the wrong times on my flight schedule days before my flight. Flights moved to 48 hours later than original booking, no consideration or discussion with the passenger. Tickets cancelled hours prior to my scheduled departure. These issues occurred over the weekend; local (Australian) call centre shut and no one responds to the numerous emails I have sent, so have to incur hundreds of dollars of international call fees to try to resolve my issue. Finally, get to Sydney airport and issued a ticket, told I would be given hotel accommodation/meals as an accommodation for my inconvenience. However, when arriving in Manila I was told I was not allowed that and the best they could do was a meal voucher (for shops that weren’t open) and I would have to stay in an overcrowded transit lounge. It was only after hours of discussion that I was finally given accommodation. When I told airline staff that Sydney had confirmed hotel accommodation for me they tried to make me out to be a liar – again, disgusting. Firstly, hotel accommodations after a significant layover is a passengers right, not a luxury.  Flights delayed from Manila to LAX causing a missed connection. Told when unloading the aircraft to pass through security and someone would help me on the other side – no one was there. I had to re-schedule my tickets myself.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Los Angeles via Manila,August 2022,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,1,"  I am a frequent international traveler and this was the worst experience I have had to date. Traveling with my wife and son, our route was Bangkok to LAX via Manila. The issues began when we arrived in Manila for our connecting flight to Los Angeles. Our flight from Manila to Los Angeles was canceled and the customer service was the worst and I have ever encountered. Those who travel often know that sometimes things happen, it is how an airline handles those issues that define their customer service. The flight was originally due to depart at 21:00, arriving in LA at about 19:00. We had an onward flight to MIA departing at 23:50. At about 18:30, one of the staff walked around telling people there was a slight delay due to mechanical issues being checked. There seemed to be no intercom system in the terminal, so it was difficult to hear what was being said. There were then no further announcements. At about 21:45, I asked the agent if there was an update and was told boarding would start at about 22:15 for a departure of 23:00. Still enough time to make our connecting flight. At about 22:45, still no announcements so asked again and was told there was another issue with the plane and no time frame was known. I then went to the business class lounge to get assistance with changing our connecting flight. The desk staff said they could not assist as it was a separate ticket. They did call customer service who also said they could not do anything to help at all. While having that conversation, they found out the flight would be canceled. I was told we would be given a hotel for the night and flight would be figured out. Us and about 20 other passengers were told to go with the agent to be taken thru immigration, to the ticket desk and to the hotel. When we arrived at the immigration counter, the agent said we were not allowed to leave the airport as we were transfer passengers. This seemed to be a surprise to the airline staff. We were then taken to the transfer desk and told business class passengers would be treated as a priority. We would have to leave our passports with immigration but could then go to the hotel before the replacement flight. When I asked when we would fly the agent was evasive and unclear. I eventually was able to find out we would fly the next afternoon at 15:30. Why we weren’t told this immediately remains a mystery. I am not sure if she was being dishonest or ignorant It was now about midnight and we were told to wait for the immigration agent. At about 2:30, 50 other passengers arrived at the transfer desk and it became clear we needed to wait for everyone to be processed. We finally left the airport at around 4. Upon arriving at the terminal the next day, I requested a complimentary guest for the business class lounge. I was told this was not possible as lounge access is not compensation for our flight cancellation. When I asked what was reasonable compensation to expect, I was told we were given a hotel room for the night. I was also told I could not have lounge access for a guest because other passengers paid for the privilege of lounge access. I asked whether I would be further compensated for the change fees for my connecting flight and was given a slip of paper with an email address. It seemed like I was expected to be grateful for being stuck in a hotel an hour away."

The agents (3 of them) just cared about going home. They tell me its American Airlines fault so they need to fix it. No, the leg of the flight that was American Airlines was booked through your website. So it's your problem. They don't care.  So I call their phone line. Phone line says, sure we can rebook you, but it'll cost you $1000 because it's a voluntary rebooting. No it's not, flight was late and I couldn't catch the connecting flight. How is that voluntary? ""Well my records say all the flights were on time."" No, it's clearly documented that the flight was late. AA has it marked as 3.5hr late arrival. ""Well I can't see those records."" Then how can you say you reviewed the records when you didn't? Look at the records and at SFO which clearly documents that the flight was late. ""I'm not going to do that. So anyway, rebooking will be an additional $1000 dollars."" "

That airline was very good. However we had delays in the USA. Weather staff shortages So my arrival to Manila was delayed During the trip my foot stole so Could not walk. I was in severe pain. It is called a gout attack. I missed my connection flight so I went to ticketing office. In the ticketing office the woman handling my concerns was very kind and understanding. Though they charged extra money and I lost things they were upgraded like meals and seats she was very understanding. The security professional and spoke kindly. Seeing I could no longer walk. They asked if I would wait my 6 hour in the office. The both represented everything right about PAL. The next security personnel came. The first told him I could not walk and I would staying there until just before my flight. He left 1 hour later. The second security officer represented everything bad. As soon as the first left he arrogantly told me to leave. Take my luggage and go. When my time came to 250 feet to the main gate I struggled in pain.

Moved again to 2130 flight which was delayed again to 2230 which we didn’t manage to depart until after 2300 and we landed past midnight the next day. No compensation whatsoever.

First time was on April 2022. Two days prior to my departure the trip suddenly disappeared from my itinerary. Spend hours trying to rectify and finally got it resolved. Talking to any representative was a major ordeal and took on average 2 hours just to get through the system. The day before my departure the new updated trip also got mysteriously cancelled. A few more hours on the phone and an extra $535 got me on a different flight. Absolutely ridiculous. Fast forward to July and problems again. They cancelled the original flight which was booked 3 months in advance and rescheduled me on a different flight with a 14 hour layover. I called Expedia and got my flight changed for the next day so I wouldn’t have such a long layover. After that I got a confirmation email from Philippines Airlines saying my flight is booked and confirmed. I then went to their website and purchased better seats. Also got confirmation email with new seat selection. It’s now the day before my trip and low and behold my flight is gone!!

We had to use the Manila airport to transit to Los Angeles on PAL102. I have no problem with Philippine Airlines. They provide a great flying service for a reasonable price. Our issue is: that if you have to fly on Philippine Airlines, then you have to use the Manila International Airport as it is PALs main hub, which is a very serious problem for tourist transiting the Philippines. The terminal we transited through is old and extremely outdated. No decent restaurants are available in the terminal. Also, very stuffy and no air circulation in the terminal. A poor excuse for a 4 star airline like PAL who has to use as their main hub. The facility is filthy and overcrowded. Security lines are long. To transit from one PAL aircraft to another PAL aircraft, we had to go through 3 different lines for 3 different security checks. 1. Had to stand in a long line for a document check. Had to wait in a small unventilated room for our checked in luggage to arrive for another inspection where each of our bags were checked. My wife almost passed out in there due to no air con and lack of ventilation in that room. 3. Another long line at the gate for another full security check. At that time, there was over 700 people waiting for PAL flights to Honolulu and Los Angeles. Don't understand why PAL schedules these flights at the same time next to each other. Once through the 3rd security check, it was very difficult to find available seats in the boarding area. Also, once in the gate area, there are no bathroom facilities until you board your aircraft. Gate agents said if you really need to go, you have to go back through the security checkpoint for another inspection. To further frustrate the passengers, PAL only had 1 agent checking in passengers at the gate. So sad for an airline like PAL to have to use this old outdated and filthy airport in Manila as their main hub for tourist to experience as their first impression of the Philippines."

Philippines airlines charge passengers for seat selection other than window seats. This aircraft is configured in economy in a 3-3 seating plan. Check in at Melbourne International was excellent. All passengers were informed while waiting of the documents to present at check in, due to Covid requirements in the Philippines. We had a problem with one of our passports, but this was resolved with the check in staff phoning the passport issuer. The flight was late boarding, with no apology, followed by a late departure. No water was provided prior to the meal service. A dental kit was provided. Lunch was the main meal service for our morning departure from Melbourne. A choice of two mains with a choice of basic drinks. Passengers were asked to close the window blinds after lunch, which I thought was unusual for a daytime flight. There was turbulence after lunch, when the turbulence had subsided, the cabin crew didn’t come through the cabin to see if anyone needed more drinks etc. There was a snack and drink provided about 1.5 hours before arrival into Manila. There were no other snacks or other drinks provided during this 8.5 hour flight, unless you used your call bell, or physically when to see the cabin crew. Wifi was available, but very slow speed, and without a constant signal. Inflight entertainment with a t.v screen in every seat, but with very limited new releases. Cost effective flight when travelling at short notice, but with disappointing cabin crew service, and basic meals."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,First Class,Los Angeles to Hong Kong via Manila,May 2022,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,no,2," Terrible service, and this is from experiences with both my legs between LAX and MNL, so this is no fluke. First leg from MNL to LAX - I was one of the first to be seated but was one of the last to be asked what I wanted for my meal. As a result, I was not able to get my first of the three options available and had to settle for the second option. In the end, I was served something I didn't order. Besides that experience, I slept most of the flight. Other mentionables, the plane was old, media availability was pretty bad, and the bathroom smelled by the end of the flight. Second leg from LAX to MNL - This time I was also one of the first to get seated but was the last person they asked for what I wanted to eat. As a result, they were already out of the first two options I wanted, and had to eat whatever was left. However, the attendant said she was going to make it up to me by giving me the first choice on breakfast. I know both meals were ordered at the same time, how did I get the first choice? This was a bit of an insult. Plus, I was forced to eat pork for dinner, so I couldn't go with my first choice of pork for breakfast again. In the end, none of the meals I had I wanted. There was also very inconsistent service on this leg. I was not given a snack or dessert, which comes standard. I find this inconsistency unacceptable for business class. Also, mid flight, I requested for a drink and snack, and it was forgotten. I had to get up and help myself, then I was served. Luckily the plane on the second leg was new, but the media was still bad. In summary, don't pay for business class with PH airlines if they are charging the same as other premium airlines, the value isn't there."

The outbound flight was uneventful although there was a minor change in the flight schedule. On the return trip it was a nightmare. Two days before the return trip, I was notified that there was a major schedule change. Instead of going non-stop from Manila to Los Angeles, Philippine Airlines stated that there would be stop for fuel. The reason I did not discover until the aircraft pulled up to the terminal. There is a distinctive difference between the 777 and the A330. The aircraft that trip was an A330. The 777 has a fuel endurance of over 15 hours. The A330 can fly for 11 hours without refueling. This is a scheduled non-stop flight.  The passengers were told that the aircraft they were using has payload issues. I asked the ticket agent if there was any chance I would miss my connection with American in Los Angeles. She said there was no chance I would miss my connection.  The stop added three hours to the trip. We departed the gate 45 minutes late. The Captain stated that we would easily makeup the lost time while enroute.  So, we land in Los Angeles. I had 30 minutes to deplane, walk 25 minutes to Customs, 45 minutes to clear customs, collect my luggage and walk 30 minutes to the connecting flight. Needless to say, my connecting flight departed while I was waiting to clear customs. The ticket agents at Los Angeles were responsible for rebooking me onto a flight the next morning, getting my family a hotel for the night. I was furious and extremely exhausted. I'm sure I came across on borderline pest. I remember stating ""You created this mess. You need to fix all of this"". Lie after incompetent decision making after lie.  I don't know what I was thinking when I bought these tickets. My other big mistake was combining a domestic flight with an international flight. "

✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Caticlan (Boracay),May 2022,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5.0,5.0,yes,9, The check-in was seamless and quick. The flight boarded and departed on-time and arrived early. The flight was uneventful and I felt safe. The snacks offered are sufficient for a quick 45+ minute flight. The only mistake that happened was when one of the flight attendants announced to 'prepare for takeoff' instead of 'prepare for landing' when we were descending towards our destination.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Los Angeles,May 2022,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,2.0,no,2,"  Trip didn’t run smoothly starting in NAIA passenger lines were disorganized, one line was irrelevant where they need to open your luggage just to disinfect/wipe only the top item , then fall in line again for check in your luggage where we learned that you have to claim them at Los Angeles if you have connecting flights.  The flight was delayed for over 2h, apology was announced but one of the crew member was not saying that it’s our choice to take this airline. What a bad customer service!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Manila,May 2022,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,1," I'm writing this review as I'm locked in ""the lounge"". Think classroom size room with, I would estimate 100 other passengers who are waiting on layovers, crammed in it. First, the plane had no headrest television. Honestly it didn't bother me, but it certainly would others. Secondly, ""the room"". This is an airport issue, but since the airline didn't disclose this at any time, I believe they are also to blame. Had they disclosed forced quarantine, I would have have never come here. Once you arrive for your layover you are locked in here until your plane boards. In my case 6 hours. There is a water dispenser, but no food. Honestly, the COVID-19 issue. If you care at all about social distancing skip this. This lounge is dirty and with the amount of people forced to be in here there is no way to avoid transmission. American prisons have more room. Honestly, I bought my tickets with only a two hour layover, I was notified a few days later that the layover time was increased significantly. Not a big deal normally, but with the ""lounge"" forced quarantine it makes it almost unbearable. With the complete lack of facilities dedicated to the layover passengers this airport locks up it would be more desirable to simply sit on the plane."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to San Francisco via Manila,April 2022,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no,1,"  One of the worst travel experiences I have ever had in my life and I travel to Asia 3x a year. Online Check in I tried to check in myself, my husband, and my son online to no avail. Error message and notification that I had to check in at the airport. Fine. Check in at Bangkok We came 3 hours early to check in at Suvarnabhumi because we heard that Philippine Airline was extremely slow. They recommended 4 hours which is unheard of. Now I understand why. Upon arrival, we were relieved as the line looked relatively short with only about 10 people ahead of us for full service. Our relief quickly turned into frustration as we stood there for over an hour! We understand that there are extra protocols while traveling nowadays, but they only had 2 people checking people in and most of the time people didnt have the right documents so they were fumbling around trying to fill out their documents on the spot. They could've had the another person at least checking the documents of people while they were in line to make sure they had all the proper documents before heading to the desk to help move it along. When we finally made it to the desk, the agent almost denied my check in because she told me that I had to have a test within 24 hours. Flying to the US requires a test 1 Day before, not 24 hours. I argued this with her and she persisted to tell me I couldn't get my boarding pass without a test 24 hours before. Finally she apologized for her mistake stating that she got confused with another country's protocols and issued my boarding pass. Flight to Manila Uneventful flight Manila Airport Experience PAL's terminal 2 in MNL is the worst transfer destination ever! Landing in Manila, we had to go to several different document check stations before going through our first baggage screening. It seemed redundant to get checked this many times within 20 ft. After our first initial baggage screening of our carryon bags, we were ushered into a small dark room with no instructions or details as to what we needed to do. They told us to wait and that's all they said. We were a bit nervous because it felt like an interrogation room. When our checked bags started showing up, they asked us to reclaim them in order to get them screened once again. Normally bags would get transferred all the way through but not here. This process seemed inefficient and disorganized. During the screening there was a confrontation between the bag screener and a passenger because they cut through his items when trying to cut open the box. Security came and detained the man. This caused a delay and we sat in the dark room longer than we felt comfortable. Inside Terminal 2, we got our documents checked several more times. All the food restaurants were cash only and there was no currency exchange desk so we could not get anything to eat or drink. Not a good predicament for a transfer person coming from another country with no pesos or dollars. There was no lounge access aside from Mabuhay. No facilities whatsoever. Strangely before boarding, we went through yet another baggage screening as if we didn't get screened enough times within one terminal. Document checks another 3 times. We sat inside the ""secured"" area before allowing to board.  Flight from MNL to SFO 30 minutes after the actual boarding time, we were finally allowed to board. However, we boarded and we sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh City to San Francisco via Manila,May 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,1,"  One of the worst experiences ever. They have delayed the Manila to San Francisco leg twice so I ended up waiting for 9 hours 30 minutes in the airport's departure area. But it wasn't even a problem before it turned out they the departure area where the company put me didn't have any service providers accepting bank cards as a way of payment. The only ATM in the area was broken. I asked the company's representatives for assistance multiple times but they didn't care and told me that there is nothing they can do and advised me to call the airport's support line. I offered to pay for access to the lounge (Terminal 2), but was told that they can't accept payment and it is accessible to business class customers only. I tried to leave the departure area and go through immigration to get out to the city, but couldn't because turned out that Philippines require only pre-departure approval for anyone who wants to pass through immigration due to COVID-19 restrictions. So, at the end I was left in the departure area unable to access any food or water for 9 hours 30 minutes before my flight. This is the most awful treatment I received from an airline in my entire life. "

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Manila,May 2021,,,,,,,1.0,no,3,"  I booked a roundtrip ticket from Dubai-Manila last January 2021 but unfortunately I was not able to fly due lockdowns. I requested for a refund on December 29, 2021, but until now I haven't received my refund. I received an email from Philippine Airlines stating that my refund will only be credited to the account I used upon booking and if my account is closed my refund will float and I need to coordinate with the issuing bank to issue a cheque. It is very difficult to do bank transaction from US to Dubai and they will not send my cheque to the US. I have a friend who works in Philippine Airlines, I asked him to follow up my refund and according to their office I can request for a cheque to be picked up in a PAL ticketing office in the Philippines. I called their customer service but they are not answering my call, tried to email them but no response. They are deducting more than 20% from the total amount as refund service fee and you will have to wait for almost four months, quite unfair right? "

Today is another long wait trying to get some result but with no avail. I sent many emails and made many phone calls and their answer is always the same ""your request is still processing"" and I even try to ask them if I could get a travel voucher if they can’t afford to refund what is the problem giving a voucher which I will be using it on their flights? they told me it can be done.  That will be the last booking on this airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Fukuoka,March 2020,,,,,,,1.0,no,1,"  The crew onboard are generally excellent on all flights, which makes up for some of their old planes and lackluster meals at times. This review is for our cancelled flight last March 2020 due to the pandemic. Since April 2020 we have been contacting them every 2-3 months online or through their hotline regarding the status of our refund. We rarely get any replies whenever we contact them online, so we would call them frequently in spite of the very long wait times. Every time they would tell us that we would just have to wait, it was already being processed. Last week, we decided to call again since it has been 2 years since that cancelled flight. Waiting two years for a refund is unacceptable, especially since their numerous flights to the US during the pandemic were usually sold out. I know because I took some of those flights. They are generating income. They are surely capable of giving refunds. I was shocked when the agent informed us that the refund is no longer eligible since it has been two years since that canceled flight, and no request for a refund was made during the validity period. This was an outright lie since as I have said, we have been contacting them every 2-3 months regarding this. They do not give any reference numbers when you call them so we had no proof of our calls. When you contact them online they rarely reply, but luckily we received an email last February 2022 saying the refund is still processing. This was proof that we were able to contact them within their so called 2 year validity period. Their inefficient refund process is the only reason why we haven't received our refund. How dare they shift the blame to their customers. When I sent them a copy of their email from February 2022, they said that we should just disregard that email because it was a mistake. Never mind the fact that this specific email was proof that we were still able to contact them within the validity period. "

Boarding was awful, I was already checked in but at the gate my boarding pass was checked 4 times - once at Covid document check, once at gate security, once when entering the waiting area, when leaving the gate towards the aircraft, once more when stepping onto the aircraft. Ridiculous bureaucracy. The aircraft was old, my seats was sticky and dirty, I wanted to avoid all surfaces. The seat pocket was torn. My food was bad, barely any meat or sauce in the dish. "

Booked a flight in October 2021 for April 2022 flight. They initially changed the time on the day of departure, then few days later changed it the next day-evening. Finally, just 3 days before we're flying they changed it 6 days later! How frustrating and disappointing is that? You've applied for annual leave 6 months in advance, made all the arrangements, booked appointments, planned how to maximise your time with your families and there they are just changing it without any considerations and detailed explanation! Just playing with everybody's time. We had to cancel our flight with them, then rebook for a new flight with another airline which cost more as it was 2 days before departure."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Cebu,August 2021,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,2.0,4.0,yes,7,"  My connecting flight arrived 6 hours late, but I finally made it to the Philippine Airlines check-in counters in Hall A of Terminal B, it was about one hour before the scheduled departure of my next flight and thankfully there was no line. I was asked for everyones passport and the agent went and made copies of the passports. The agent seemed as worried as I was as she kept looking at her watch due to the forty-five minute check-in cut off time. Then a supervisor walked out with our copied documentation and asked for my marriage certificate and child’s birth certificate. They seemed to be worried that my wife was flying with her maiden name passport, although with Filipino tradition my child has my wife’s maiden name as their middle name. After several rounds of checking and double checking the supervisor gave to ok! After check in I preceded to security for the routine ID and bag check. At this point I was really worried, as now our flight was suppose to be boarding. The new satellite terminal PAL is assigned to is not connected to the airport via their free transportation. You must walk 15-20 minutes to get from security to the new Terminal B building. And after you arrive arrive at the Terminal building, gate 207 which is one of the last gates is another 5-10 minutes of walking. They do have courtesy carts, but I continued to walk briskly as these were full of older couples. Luckily Boarding was delayed and started just as we arrived. It easy, as they boarded by group and made sure everyone was boarding by their assigned group. We boarded in the family group and made our way to our seats. The flight attendant pointed out our arm rest did not adjust and move out of the way on seats 68 ABC and asked if we would like to utilize the center row as the arm rest did move. So my wife moved there and enjoyed the added space. Although I stayed and was later annoyed by the arm rest. We were quickly in the air and served a variety of Filipino and western dishes which were small but tasty. I tried the Filipino dish for dinner and the western dish for breakfast, half way through the flight they did turn on the cabin lights and serve a sandwich as a snack, I wish it was optional, so we could continue to sleep but it was a hot and tasty sandwich. Other airlines provide attendants through the cabin silently serving select drinks or snacks. But Philippine Airline’s cabin was void of all attendants except when someone called them. They were in the back galley but very happy to assist if needed. After breakfast with about an hour and a half left they handed out the the required paperwork. A customs declaration, passenger undertaking affidavit, arrivals card, and health declaration card. The flight attendant also went over all the rules and regulations for quarantine and import restrictions including the pork product ban due to Asian Swine flu. After arrival into Cebu the flight attendant asked every one deplane in an appropriately distanced manner. But we deplaned as normal."

After explaining things 3 times over no we had a positive covid test on that date we are unable to fly. Then the reply why you did not fly that date. My reply was because we had Covid.

We bought a ticket and choose Philippine airlines because we thought it will help us lessen stress or inconvenience for our travel but then even if the ticket are so expensive, the services they offer are not worth the money we pay. At first they cancelled our scheduled flight instead of December 7, 2021 3pm Toronto to Vancouver to December 8, 2021 9am. We landed at terminal 2 in Manila Dec 9, 2021 7:30pm. After following all the protocols, we waited for a long time for our baggage in the conveyor but it’s not there. After 4 days during our quarantine in the hotel, they deliver our luggags. It is still so frustrating that all the things that we need during this quarantine are all there in the luggage. It cost us so much inconvenience especially that I have my daughter with me. The money we pay is not worth the services they offer."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Manila,May 2020,,,,,,,1.0,no,1,"  We booked flights for May 2020. PAL cancelled them because of covid and so starts the saga of the non existent refund! We tried every way possible, even found a few indirect ways to get hold of them. Always it's the standard line of ""Just wait 5 more billing cycles sir"". They also promise to expedite it all as well like that isn't just another line they are told to read out. We now have solicitors trying to recover our money, nearly £1400. We are not at all optimistic. My advice to anyone attracted by the bright livery and Mabuhay smile is to stay well clear.  They are not giving refunds and they are not seemingly bothered if they cancel flights either. Before Covid they were not great, we travelled using them many times. Poor inflight meals and entertainment. They delayed flights many times on us over the years whilst other operators flew the same routes, the cheaper ones like Cebu Airlines and Air Asia. We had better service on both those."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Melbourne to Manila,September 2020,,,,,,,1.0,no,1,"  Shocking customer service. More than a year and still no refund on a fully refundable business class fare. They do not even care to answer to follow-up, just an automated email ""your refund is in process"". I would certainly advise against choosing that airline and certainly being very careful on their fully flexible / fully refundable fares, they have no intention of giving you your money back."

We have been told on 3 separate occasions that we would have to wait 5 billing cycles for the money to be credited to our account. It’s early August 2021 now and we’ve waited since our flights were cancelled 15 months ago. It’s been a year and 3 months, 6 long distance phone calls to customer service (because at first they weren’t even answering their toll free line) and many stressful conversations with still no refund in sight. When I call and ask to speak to a manager they tell me that no manager is available. This is hands down the worst customer service I’ve ever received. I love to travel and I love a good deal but you get what you pay for with this airline. That said, I’m out $2000 plus dollars and to me that’s a good chunk of change."

Twice I optimistically bought tickets to be home with my family in the last two years. Both times had to cancel because quarantine requirements there and here (Canada) would mean spending more than a month in an isolation hotel. I am well over a year waiting for the first refund, and about 7 months on the second. I have been a loyal customer for over a decade and rethinking my loyalty to them."

I cancelled the flight in December and awaited a refund minus a %. I contacted the company in January and was told my refund had been paid. It hadn't. I contacted them nearly 50 times until in November 2020 they announced that my refund would be paid before April 2021. Over a year to get 30,000 pesos back. For 10 months they insisted that my bank had made a mistake. Unacceptable on every level."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Brisbane,December 2020,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,5.0,yes,9," Am mainly writing this review in response to recent comments I have read regarding refunds due to the pandemic. Last traveled with PAL in December 2020 just before the pandemic and the trip was fine, pretty good service, typical airline food and fair value for money. I then booked a flight in February 2021 for the end of August 2021 when they had a promotion on at a very cheap price hoping that borders may be open by then. The offer was for full refund or change of dates if flights cancelled etc due to the pandemic. Flight was cancelled about 12 days ago which I understand as borders are still closed and I opted for refund option. Money arrived back in my account today which is less than half the time they even stated being up to 30 days. Whether or not that I paid using PAYPAL made a difference I don't know, but I simply applied for refund using their online application. So just letting people know not every refund experience with PAL is a bad one."

Received e-mail a week before the flight stating move to a later timing which was good giving me chance to work whole day before going to airport. Check in was a breeze due to limited number of flights operating at Riyadh airport. Flight was not full which I suspect to due to Philippine government's limitation at Manila Airport's passenger traffic. Food was ok and each passenger was given face shield. Overall flight was well-managed despite limitations.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Manila,April 2021,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1.0,no,1, Do not book! This airline is selling tickets for false flight. I have been canceled 4 times already since March 23. If you check their website all dates are available to book then they reschedule you and then cancel you last minute.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to Manila,May 2020,2.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1.0,no,1," I have flown with Philippine Airlines on many occasions and found their business class service to be acceptable, while there are many other airlines that offer better business class service, I choose to fly with Philippine Airlines because of the direct flight flight from San Francisco to Manila.  On May 10, 2020, my flight to the Philippines was canceled due to the Covid lockdown and I was offer a refund, it has been over 10 months since I requested a refund and I still have not received the fund. I have contacted Philippine Airlines by phone and emails many times and their customer service has been completely unhelpful. Every time I call Philippine Airlines, I am told to wait and that the refund has been processed. It appears to me that the airline does not want to refund their passengers and are using delay tactics. So travelers be aware that if you fly with Philippines Airline and a flight disruption occurs, you will be out the cost of your airline ticket. I have had other flights canceled on me with other airlines and refunds were received within two billing cycles. This is totally unacceptable for Philippine Airlines to not return customers funds for service that they did not provide. I would not recommend flying with Philippine Airlines."

They moved my brother's flight 3 days later than originally scheduled. There was an alternative flight which is not a direct flight but they refused to give that option. My brother is here to attend a family occasion and PAL ruined it. My brother cannot fly back 3 days later than what we've scheduled. 48 hours is acceptable but not 3 because he has work. The last offer they have for me is for a full refund but will not get the money after 5 billing cycles. I still have a lot of pending refunds which I'm still getting false promises for 8 months now.

First thing that happened was they rescheduled the flight from Feb 10 to Feb 17. They claimed there was overcrowding and that was the reason. I noticed the plane was also changed from a A350 to a B777. It’s a good thing I called them after that to confirm because my wife was rescheduled for the new date but our baby wasn’t (for some reason). So his name didn’t even appear on the list of passengers for the new date! The second stupid thing that happened was...my wife bought a stroller to make it easier for her and our baby to travel inside the airport, ie check in to gate etc., and carry bags at the same time. She checked the stroller in at the gate but when they landed in Toronto, they announced that the stroller has been sent to be claimed at the carousel! That means she was holding the baby all the way from the gates to immigration, and to the baggage claim! That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard. I haven’t flown PAL mainly because of the reviews, I only booked them for my family co they were the only direct flight. We will never fly with them again."

However, Philippine Airlines rise to the occasion. Riyadh to Manila flight left as scheduled as per their e-mail 2 weeks before informing us of the change is timing. Along the way, they provided us all with face shields where we were required to wear through out the journey. Food was adequate but not much understandably due to the current situation Upon arrival we took the PRC test from their affiliated Laboratories where we got the result in less than six hours.

The incoming flight with TK is ok, then the government requires a PCR test and the awaiting of results in a government approved hotel. After the results are released, travelers are allowed to continue to their final domestic destination. PAL scheduled my flight for the morning following a nighttime arrival and are not willing to change the booking despite their government making it illegal to take the only flight they are offering. No other choice than buying a new ticket and forfeiting the existing ticket without being able to use it. Countless emails and even support attempts through TK went unanswered."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Los Angeles to Manila,September 2020,4.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,no,5," Two things shine about PAL. Their staff are super friendly and eager to help, more so than any other Asian airline that I've experienced. Secondly, PAL was the only airline of a total of 5 that did not cancel an itinerary on this trip. For these two reasons, the review is 5/10 stars instead of 1. The food was unfortunate. Meals were reheated and inedible. Not what I would expect in business class. I realize airlines are utilizing no contact meal service, but the food would not qualify as a meal. The 777 is an old aircraft and 2-3-2 configuration just doesn't cut it in business class anymore. When I arrived in MNL at 4 in the morning, I discovered that one of my bags was damaged. The PAL website indicates you have 7 days to report damage. I reported it after I finished my mandatory quarantine, just 2 days later and was told that they would not take care of my damaged luggage because I didn't report it right away at baggage claim and ""someone else"" might have caused the damage. Some airlines have been blaming the COVID pandemic for the abuses they heap on their passengers. What airlines should keep in mind is that when the pandemic is over, we have a choice of airlines to fly, and we will remember which airlines treated us well, and which did not. PAL did not. PAL made a bad choice here with my luggage issue. I generally fly across the Pacific in business class 4 to 5 times a year. I won't choose PAL next time. Refusing to repair or replace my suitcase is penny wise and pound foolish, because PAL will be one of my last choices in the future."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to London via Manila,March 2020,4.0,4.0,,,,3.0,1.0,no,2,  They would not let me change to an earlier flight to get home during the COVID situation without paying a fee - which was more than what I originally paid. I asked for a refund then because their website claimed they would give them out due to the situation but I would have to send it by mail or call. So I tried calling and waited on the line for about an hour without any answer. I sent them an email explaining the situation and they were very unresponsive and simply told me the flight had been cancelled due to lock down. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Manila,November 2019,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no,1,"  I had the misfortune of being booked on a Philippine Airlines flight from LAX to MNL in November 2019 with my two very young daughters. At every opportunity, I was met with disorganization and poor communication. The flight did leave on time, and returned to LAX after an engine failure.  They left us far from the terminal while they sprayed down the engine. After waiting for the paramedics to take off the panic attack people and going down the stairs and taking the shuttle and walking through the airport they couldn't offer another flight. They couldn't tell me when they could offer another flight. They couldn't offer me travel vouchers, offer me a refund,accept my request to cancel my flight and get a refund. After hours of waiting in line  all they had for me was a phone number to call where I could potentially cancel and get a refund. I guess the 300 other people on the flight also got the number. It was always busy and I couldn't get through. I had the charges cancelled on the credit card. Later, the charges were re-instated because Philippine Airlines reported that I 'missed' a different flight a few days after the flight we had booked. They never contacted us by phone, email, or mail to let us know the new date. The flight they said we missed was 3 days after our scheduled flight. Despite our booking confirmation and boarding passes showing the earlier dates, and news reports showing the plane's engine failure on the same date, they only had to show the credit card company a single document showing the revised date as if it was the only date there ever was.  After many more attempts to call PA, we are finally able to get through. Initially they want to say it's our fault for missing the flight they didn't bother to tell us about after giving us contact information that never worked, but they agree to give us a refund and send an email documenting it. But they want something like 6 weeks for the refund to go through. The refund never comes. If you call them, they will tell you the problem is with your 'bank' which is really the credit card company. The credit card company never got the money back. If you try to contest the charges after the 'refund' period, the credit card company now says it's 'too late' to help you. "

Clean aircraft, food is fine, on time and arrival sequence is good.

Was meant to fly from London to Kuala Lumpur with a 2-hour layover in Manila. 1 day before the flight,  Philippine Airlines sent out a notification saying the original 2-hour layover has been changed to a 12 hour one, overnight. As I was rushing to make last-minute arrangements due to their change, I asked them if they could provide me with free accommodation in Manila airport, being a solo female traveller. After hours of calling them from London, and being put on hold and passed from one person to another, and even up till the day of my travel, they were not able to confirm anything with me. No compensation nor accommodation. In the end, I cancelled the flight as they said they would be able to refund this in full. It is now 1 month and 1 week after the flight and I still haven't received any refund in my bank account. I received a notification saying the refund had been processed and would take up to 30 days to be reflected in my account. 30 days have come and gone and still nothing. No responses to emails. When I called up Philippine Airlines, I was put on hold and passed from person to person, each time repeating the history of my case. When I asked for proof that the refund had gone through, the line was cut."

We were shocked when were told by our agent that the Japan flight is non refundable and non cancellable based on PALS policy and would have to pay $350 rebooking fee for our cancelled flight from San Francisco to Manila. Philippine Airlines in refusing to give refunds for travel cancellations. It is a sound and reasoned business practice to refund cancelled trips specially in times of crisis and the passenger is left with no choice at all.

I just want to take some time to give this splendid travel experience a great review. It was my first time to ride Philippine Airlines because I needed a direct flight going to London. Due to the unfortunate reason of Corona Virus. Check in counter staff was very nice to give me the seat along the middle row.  Instructions were given clearly as well. They are not very strict with in terms of baggage allowance and they will assist you to solve luggage problems. I am happy how the crew provided services and very attentive to the passengers needs. They have hot towels, personal hygiene kit, very good touch screen telly, and nice movies as well. I was able to sleep properly and the lights are very beautiful. They have the most delicious food inside the aircraft. I have commend all the Filipino Crew who were true to their job. Id also like to thank Jan for being very sensitive to others need and for making my PAL experience memorable.  Thanks Philippine Airlines. Im looking forward to flying with you again and again. "

Water, two choices of juice, three kinds of soda, tea and coffee was offered as well. Inflight crew were kind and accommodating.

This time and also for the flight going back, it was enjoyable and efficient for the flight. The space is very decent and the crew is easy to talk to, polite and professional. My only complaints on the flight itself are food and entertainment.  The mains and desserts are tasty but I didn't finish the meal on both flights. Inflight console is just ok. Good amount of movies but I would've appreciated more airline content or maybe about the place I'm traveling to etc. On ground, I o find the queuing quite slow. I think it has more to do with them bunching up the opening on counters close to their other flights. Overall, a great option for the right prices and times when convenient to you! Although I would have another first choice, this airline has improved from my past experiences."

My flight was cancelled due to a volcanic eruption in the Philippines. I only found out at the airport, even though the eruption had occurred and the flights had been cancelled a day ago - I didn't hear about it on the news because I was travelling. Philippine Airlines told customers that we could call a number the next day to either arrange a refund or to try to book a later flight. He couldn't tell us whether or not upcoming flights were full or not. He didn't apologise and didn't offer alternative flights or even accommodation, even though it was late in the evening.

First of all, the flight left on-time with around 98% load factor. Distributed umbrella to every passenger boarding into the plane. Food in Business Class for a 45-minute flight was very acceptable. It was a typical Filipino breakfast with a good quantity and was tasty. Ground service was a bit chaotic but understandable due to a small airport terminal and huge number of passengers going back to Manila after spending holidays in the province. A ""goodbye wave"" by the ground staffs are always a beautiful gesture."

My flight was 3:30 AM and all the counters has a long queue since all flights were assigned with the same counter. I admit that its my fault since our baggage exceeded the allowable limit. But we’ve done it on time and we just wait for our turn to check-in. Later on I’ve heard a lady shouting last check-in for Cebu so we immediately transfer to another queue that is shorter. 2:52 am was the time that we check-in our bag and the crew told us they cannot longer accept check-in flight bound to Cebu since their last call is 2:45 am. I was hoping that they’ll consider it since the flight was 3:30 am and they saw us in the line waiting for our turn. And since we weren't allowed to check in, we have to book a flight worth 9.9k each and we have to pay another bill for “convenience fee”. I always trusted PAL and book every flight back and forth with PAL."

The representative told me that I would have received an email within 12 hours. On our return flight, the aircraft and seats were different. No screens and  claustrophobic seats.

It was hard for my partner to book using miles because it could not be done online. We had to call their 1-800 number and it took forever for someone to answer. Their customer service is not competitive as other airlines I have flown with. The flight was okay but my seat was quite uncomfortable and my food was not good. The service was standard."

Everything is good for the airplane but for Bags delayed the customer services failed. First its their fault cannot make it during 1 hour transit at Manila which is this scheduled made by them. Then on that time they didn’t give us any basic kit set or give any compensation clothes to us. Just give us the promise our baggage they will bring around 2 pm next day.  We need to wait for the bags. And then the bags arrived at 7.30 pm which is 24 hours from our arrival time at LAX. When i email them about compensation they ignored. Fine. They don’t want to take the responsibility for apologies so I’ll try claim insurance. Then I emailed for the information on the acknowledgment received bag for insurance claim purposed until now I didn’t get it. It’s really make us angry. Very bad customer services.

Poor leg space for a lie flat service. Entertainment is poor.  The worst ground service I have come across. You are required to clear security and clear your luggage during transit. This takes 2 hours and is absolute chaos. You have to push your way through to walk through a single security screen, only to wait for another line to clear your luggage. The ordeal lasts for 2 hours and is harrowing.  The business class lounge in Manila is below average. The shower was broken. I received a casual and vague response that it has been reported 2 weeks ago. Food is limited and average. Would not waste business class dollars on this sub standard service."

Philippine Airlines are doing all their best to achieve 5-Star rating in the coming years and I think they are on the right track. First, service both on ground and on-board greatly improved. Second, with the acquisition of state-of-the-art planes for European and American flights. However, there are things I noticed that are on the decline like the meals for the Middle Eastern routes, the fruit is gone, replaced with non-healthy alternative - chocolates & some buns. They probably did this for convenience which I believe is not a good idea. Pilots are good, cabin attendants cheerful. Power outlet in every seat is a life saver especially when you watch movies via MyPal player."

The service and genuinely friendly cabin crew on Philippine Airlines, combined with state of the art, individual TV’s, with a host of films to watch, made the time shoot past me like a breeze. The only downside is the lack of a paid airport lounge at Terminal 2 at NAIA. I hope this is addressed in the future. There is a PAL business lounge, but for those not travelling business, there isn’t even a cafe you can sit down at to pass the time. Just a warning to those who like to arrive mega early to avail of the whole airport experience, don’t bother. Catch some extra sleep instead. In terms of the Philippine Airlines experience, I think at 4 star they are underrated. With the awesome cabin crew alone, not forgetting the geese in flight experience, new planes, excellent pilots and more besides, PAL are 5 star in my book. Thanks PAL for an awesome experience!"

Check in at Riyadh Airport was a breeze as I was able to do it via Business Class counter due to my frequent flyer status. Baggage tagged ""priority"" and was among the first to be offloaded at MNL Airport. The flight was basic with the high density configuration on this A330-300 which means 3x3x3 seats abreast. Although cramped & full packed, the flight crew were outstanding on their job, with occasional smile & ready to assist attitude. I really hope that someday Philippine Airlines changes its plane on this route with a more comfortable long-range aircraft similar to the ones they use for their Europe & America flights. But overall it was a great offering from PAL."

We were ushered to the departure process smoothly then to the lounge, and finally to the gate for boarding done smoothly without any delay.. Inside the cabin is clean and smelling fresh, happy and cheerful FAs, Inflight entertainment with selection of movies, tv etc. But to me the most wonderful feature of this Airbus Neo 321 is the flat bed with its super nice comforter and pillow. And the meals from its taste and presentation is a dining experience to cherish. Take off was bit early, arrival, luggage retrieval was orderly. So my hubby said all good things, comfort and attention command a price. All worth it. But I have a suggestion, there should be a provision of standby pillow when and where it is needed..The FA went to the economy cabin to get one. My hubby has bit of discomfort issues having one pillow, sorry for bringing this out. Kudos to Philippine Airlines, who have gone far to its level now and striving more for 5 star rating."

However, within the space of just a few weeks, PAL sent me an email to state that my flights had inexplicably been cancelled and I should contact them by phone for a full refund. No further explanation was offered. It took a long time to reach one of their customer service agents by phone, and when I did so, they were far from helpful. After an initial complaint, a customer service agent wrote to me on April 1, 2019, stating that she would be personally helping me with my claim. I have since written to her on 9 separate occasions, but have never heard from her again. Eventually, after over 2 months of unanswered correspondence, PAL finally refunded the 748 USD I paid for the flights. To this day, PAL are refusing to refund me for the 60 USD they charged mefor a seat on a flight which they cancelled. "

Upon take-off lunch was served and all the snacks after that were given ahead since we were only four passengers, and a cabin crew made the rounds asking if we want to drink specially if you are watching IFE. The flight was quite bumpy since we have to pass through some monsoon clouds in our flight path. Overall, again the flight experience was okay. We arrived at our destination an hour ahead of schedule. I advise that you bring a jacket or sweater on this flight since the cabin I was in was quite cold."

In this area of the plane (used to be Premium Economy) you have to pay additional price for the seat. Flight was full as always due to the upcoming 4 days holiday in Saudi Arabia. Flight was smooth, Cabin Crew were always on their toes and moving around specially in my area. Configuration was 3-3-3. It was good that the pilot reminded the passengers to use the lavatory within their section, and thus the lavatory in this area was only used by passengers in my section. In flight entertainment was okay by using My Pal Player, and make sure you have the 3 pin charger to have your tablet or phone charged while watching the IFE. There is port under the seat right side (on my seat). Overall, I love travelling by Philippine Airlines. We arrived on time, although departed Riyadh a little bit late since the plane prior to our flight (Kuwait Airways) that is using our gate as well was delayed so we were brought to our plane by bus."

I went to the complain counter and staff wrote down the information. He asked for my email address, made me sign the paper and gave a photo copy of it with the phone number of PAL's claim dept.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philippines to Toronto ,April 2019,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,no,1," Poor custom resolution and horrific in-flight service. Unsanitary seats, exposed to biohazards. Philippines Airlines does not compare to ANA or Korean Air. Ratings say it all on Skytrax. The passenger in front of me vomited all over the seats in front of me. The vomit leaked through the seats and piled up on my carry-on bag tucked under the seat in front of me. A putrid, sour odour overtook our seating area. Unknowingly, I reached for my carry-on to grab some snacks and found a coat of liquid all over my hands, which transferred over to my lap easily. After smelling it, I was well aware it was vomit. With another 10 hours left in flight, I knew this had to be cleaned up or my nausea would've caused another vomiting incident. The flight attendants did not offer to clear the area and clean it. Proper airlines would have had the required cleaning agents and sanitized and deodorized the area as it is a biohazard that exposes fellow passengers to health risks. Empathy would have been appreciated knowing I had 10 hours left to fly in such an awful predicament! Moreover, I had to ask the flight attendant for wet towels and bags four times, stressing each time how much vomit I was dealing with, only to receive a few each and every time. Half of my carry on holding my snacks and documents were tossed out due to having traces of vomit on it. I also had to sit with my legs up on my seat for 10 hours since I could not extend my legs under my seat due to the vomit. I wreaked of vomit as well. When I contacted their customer resolution detailing my horrific flight and asking for a refund, it took them months to get a final response - a lot of ""I hope you can be assured we are looking into this matter."" Finally I received no resolution in their final email with a refusal to compensate me in any way. Not even a voucher! I am not one known to be a complaining consumer, but the way this was handled in-flight and from a custom resolution perspective is unjust and uncaring. Try Cathay Pacific or Japan Airlines. This is no professional or compassionate airline."

The aircraft has WiFI and passengers get free 100mb for the flight - the connection was fast. A hot meal was served considering its only a 2-hour flight! Bathrooms are well maintained.

Philippine Airlines is one of the most improved airlines apparently, however, their terminal had a lot to be desired. Facilities are totally dated and inadequate for the number of passengers. There are not enough food outlets or toilets and it just saps the energy out of you trying to negotiate the place. It's a very small zoo, to be honest! The saving grace is the terminal transfer bus and free wifi. Prices are quadruple what you'd pay outside. The aircraft I flew on (A321NEO) is very nice, comfortable, spacious with screen back TVs. The flight crew were professional, average and I thought they'd be super friendly and show visibly to passengers that enjoy what they do, the Filipino way. Everything just seemed kind of robotic and lacking a bit of heart and humanity. The food on PAL is disgusting. It seriously needs some attention to detail and flavour. All meals were horrible and honestly, it was the worst food I've ever had on an airline. I'm not sure I'll fly with them again as competitors fly from Terminal 3 which is a lot better (excellent food court) in my opinion."

Transfer between terminal spoiled the trip 1. When stopover at Manila airport for the connecting flight. Airport staff took away the passport and boarding pass, and we had to stay in the waiting area to wait for them to call our name to board the bus to another terminal. On the way to Vancouver, I waited about 30 min and back to Singapore, waited for more than an hour. All the time the passport and boarding keep by airport staff. Till enough passengers, then call name one by one and follow the staff to go to take the transfer bus to other terminal. By then we get back our passport and boarding pass. According to the staff, it’s the procedure that everyone has to follow. It’s make the transit time more than an hour especially as I’m the first to reach the transit counter 2. Although the service is ok as per normal, but the stewardess accidentally hit my cup and the water pour on me, not once but twice. She is very nice and keeps on apologizing, I'm not blaming her, but Wearing my wet thick jeans throughout the whole journey is very uncomfortable. Suggest airline to provide spare clothes for loan. 3. After changed seat due to the seat is wet, the remote control is not working for the new seat, the top light can’t go on. Although they offer to change seat again, I gave up. Suggest airline should check the system before boarding 4.

However, the plane sat at the gate for about an hour. Twice the pilot made an announcement that the delay was because of cargo being loaded. After an hour the plane finally took off. Upon landing in Toronto (YYZ) a flight attendant read off the names of about 15-20 people and advised them to ""see an agent"". As my name was called, I asked a flight attendant about this when I disembarked. She didn't give me any more information and just said to see an agent.  I waited at the baggage carousel to get my luggage for a while and then I heard the same announcement of people's names. They asked us to go to the baggage desk. There were forms already filled out with all of our names and baggage info. Our luggage was not loaded at Manila and would be delayed. The reason was that the weight of cargo was exceeded. Philippines Air staff have been completely unhelpful in resolving my issue. It has been almost 2 days and I still have no news about my luggage. "

When we came to Siargao we paid 1000 pesos for 20kgs so we did not expect this amount. To put it in perspective - my ticket price was around 2400 pesos.

On the return from SFO to BKK we had 5 hours. The transfer deak is chaos, they took our passports for an hour then shouted our names and escorted us through 3 screening checks, onto a bus and to a different terminal. It would have been WAY easier to leave the airport via immigration and jump in a cab to the other terminal. For a long transfer there is nothing to do at terminal 2. The flights themselves were great, zero issues, friendly staff, new planes. One of our bags didn't turn up on the return but have been advised it will be delivered this evening. PAL are a good airline with fair prices, only issue is the airport and consequently the transfers."

Due to aircraft operational issues in Manila, this flight was rescheduled to depart and arrive two hours later than originally scheduled. We were informed of this one full week in advance. Upon arrival at check-in, I was given two surprises. One was that my pre-selected aisle seat had suddenly been changed to a middle seat. The other was that I was given a $20 meal voucher. I'm still not entirely sure whether the meal voucher was given because of the changed seat assignment or because of the later departure. At any rate, the flight departed exactly on time and arrived about 40 minutes early to Manila. This was perfect, as it meant I basically cleared customs and immigration in Manila at the scheduled arrival time. The flight safety video was restarted midway through, but from that point onward, there were no issues with the inflight entertainment seatback monitors for the remainder of the flight. Still no games available and still no subtitles for films, though (except for those which automatically came with subtitles in their original version, as was the case with some of the Filipino films). The food was fine, although it was less interesting than on my earlier flight from Manila to New York. I was also a bit disappointed that there appeared to be no peanut butter in the sauce for my caldereta. Rolls were served by placing them onto our entree boxes during meals--except that during breakfast, they seem not to have served rolls to any of us in my section. (They served rolls to people a few rows ahead of us and then just stopped.) As always, the flight attendants were pleasant and usually attentive. I got thirsty at one point during this flight as well, and yet again, when I pressed the call button, a flight attendant appeared already with a cup of water. She also agreed to getting me a cup of orange juice. The amenity kits were provided again, too, and those are always appreciated. The biggest problem, however, during this flight pertained to the lavatories. The drains for the sinks appeared to be clogged, and we ran out of toilet paper midway through the flight. I was somewhat nervous when using the lavatory at times when there was periodic turbulence, out of fear that the water standing in the sinks might spill out. Other than that, though, overall the flight was pretty good, and it really is nice to be able to get all the way from New York to Manila nonstop."

Not so. Our experience is that this airline is every bit as unreliable, inflexible, poor service and communication as any of the cheapest airlines.

Having watched all the videos surrounding the introduction of the A350 on the route London to Manila with PAL, I thought I would give them a try for my latest trip to the Philippines. Cost wise this carrier is still more expensive than others serving the two cities, however PAL does operate a direct flight. I used their “Upgrade” system and bid on a business class outward upgrade, the day before I flew I was notified that this had been excepted. So, suitcase in hand with a generous 40 kg allowance I arrived at a line of packed check in counters, feeling special walking straight up on the red carpet to be greeted by name the assistant. Check-in was smooth, I noticed that many desks were open to deal with a full flight quickly and efficiently. Being a business passenger, I was invited to the Aspire Lounge which caters for many carriers. The variety of foods available was poor, Quiche, two rice dishes, pasta in a tomato sauce & soup of the day. No white bread or rolls, just brown rolls, a few items of salad sides, jam and crackers and cheese. As a PAL passenger I was entitled to a small bowl of Chicken Arroz Caldo. The choice of drinks available was what I would have expected. My seat number was 2A, a front seat on the left hand of the aircraft. I was taken back by the comfort of this new seat, so well made with everything I would need to use throughout the flight close at hand. Champagne in hand and introductions to Lisa who would be looking after me throughout this 13-hour epic. The IFE system had plenty of choice and the headphones were of good quality, for me personally I would of like more UK tv programmes than the usual mix of American so-called comedies. The system was easy to navigate.  I feel that with a few improvements on the menu regarding choice and quality would help this airline gain a 5-star rating, don’t get me wrong the taste was good, the portion size could have been more, but I can see these meals being smaller in size being served in economy. Inflight snacks are available, from the usual pot style noodle to a ham burger! My glass was never empty my host Lisa was ever present with the bubbly. Sleep quality was second to none, laying in my flat bed with a huggable pillow was bliss, my 40 winks had me arriving refreshed and rearing to go. The flight attendants or hosts as I would like to call them, truly are the best & do deliver the “From the Heart” experience Flying PAL into Manila is a god send the airline uses terminal 2, basically a terminal for PAL only, immigration was breeze, no waiting in line, airport temperature good, baggage arrived quickly.

So the meal service began, and I got a chicken inasal which is kinda plain. After 5hrs crew started to began distributing snacks since it’s around 4am Manila time and the sandwich is really good, I must say. The good thing is that they don’t have to turn on the cabin lights during snacks service because most of the passengers are resting, or they’re asleep and The crew gives you snack even though you’re not awake, they’re just putting it in your tray-table. Entertainment really outdated and needs to be refurbished. And the wifi on my flight is not even working. The cabin is so amazing and it’s cabin temperature is just perfect. The lavatories are well-maintained by the crew. So 2hrs before arrival, the crew started to give out hot towels again so we can prepare for arrival, and the breakfast meal service commenced, they have a western and filipino option. I must say I don’t really liked their dinner and breakfast meal service that much because it’s kinda tasteless.

We arrived at Suvarnabhumi Airport on May 31, 2019 for our 5.55pm Flight PR737 to Manila at 3.55pm. When we went to the check-in we were advised that PAL had changed the plane to a smaller one, so we were bumped, but we would be compensated by a free return flight anywhere in Asia, valid for one year and we would also be taken to an hotel to rest and have a meal. They asked which flight we would like to take instead, we opted for the 1.30am next day, which would allow more than 5 hours in Manila till the domestic flight. It took them more than 3 hours to rebook the flights, issue boarding passes and get us to the hotel. It was a nice hotel and we were able to have buffet dinner, however, there was little time to rest before returning to the airport. When we got back to the airport it was 11.15pm, only to find out from the departure board that the 1.30am flight had been delayed till 4.30am. No one contacted the hotel to inform us. They did give a meal voucher for only THB400 each, for Bangkok airport outlet prices? We were to pick up vouchers for the free flights when we went back for 1.30am flight. But the story had changed, the validity for the free flights was only 6 months. If so, this would mean the children could not avail of the flights, since they will be in school for more than 6 months before having a holiday. Then there was some doubt whether these tickets would be for Asia, or only to Thailand. The flight left at 4.40 am and landed in Manila about 9.10 am and had to go through Immigration, baggage claim  and transfer T2 to T3. We raced to the T3 check in and arrived exactly 45 minutes before the 11.15 am PAL flight to Dumaguete, just as they were about to close. I got charged P1,600 for 3kg excess baggage.

✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to New York JFK,May 2019,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,4.0,3.0,yes,8,"  Manila to New York. I don't normally fly this route, as I live closer to Clark in the Philippines and closer to Boston in the United States.  I originally had plans in New York this time though, so I had an excuse to try this route. Unfortunately, our plane was 35 minutes late to arrive at our gate in Manila. Gate staff asked people to volunteer to check luggage as the flight was supposedly fully booked. However, upon boarding, I found that there were many seats which were never occupied. Otherwise, the gate staff handled the boarding professionally given the late arrival of the plane. We would have made up for some lost time if it were not for delays for taking off. On board the aircraft, the seats were comfortable. I was particularly pleased I was able to fit my small traveling bag in the seatback pocket in front of me. (That doesn't always happen.) An adequate amenities kit was provided. I found the safety video shown to be quite touching--and very Pinoy. As for the food, I was honestly surprised by how creative some of the meals offered were. (The food I have had on Philippine Airlines in the past was usually good, but simpler.) We were served two full meals and a ""hot snack,"" which was basically like a full meal without the standard salad and roll. It was just the right amount of food for the flight--not too little, and not too much. I was a bit disappointed at first that the flight attendants did not come through the cabin offering water and/or juice between services, but I later realized it was a good thing in that I felt no pressure to accept such drinks. I did, however, get very thirsty at one point and pressed the call button. A flight attendant arrived, already carrying a cup of water for me. Impressive! One thing I do not understand, however, is why there is no pineapple juice available. I mean, pineapple juice is found pretty much anywhere in the Philippines. And if Philippine Airlines took a walk on the wild side and offered something like Del Monte Pineapple-Blueberry juice, then the airline could gain a cult following over it, like Jet Blue's serving blue potato chips on their flights in the United States. It would be something that stands out. Perhaps the biggest issue I found with this flight was the entertainment system. While I appreciate that individual seatback monitors were available, there were three big issues. One was that the system had to be rebooted in the middle of the flight and was stalling repeatedly before that reboot happened. The second was that there appeared not to be any games available. The third was a lack of subtitles for films. It seems odd that the Korean and Chinese films did not have subtitles in English or Tagalog. Even for films in English, I know that many Filipinos would appreciate subtitles in English, as the subtitles make it easier for them to understand the film. Lastly, the price for my round-trip ticket was typical of Philippine Airlines: not really expensive, but also not cheap. This is one area where Philippine Airlines could improve. Overall, I enjoyed my flight and am looking forward to my return flight. Salamat, Philippine Airlines, and congratulations on your new 4 Star Ranking! "

Only at the gate did we notice that our seats were not together as I was assigned to row 52 and he was to row 72. I had a window seat but a passenger took it just like that. So I just took an aisle seat at the center column. The cabin crew did not really assist or guide the passengers to their correct seat assignment.

Nobody could tell me why my booking reference included the extra luggage. No arguing or discussion with supervisor and on-site manager helped. Because I had not prepaid according to them the double-rate applied. Absolutely abysmal! Sheer highway robbery! What an airline and what management. I will avoid Philippine Airlines in future! So for ripping me off an extra 3,000 Peso they lost much more in future business. PAL is a disgrace for the Philippines and its wonderful people. What a welcome!

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Manila to Iloilo City ,April 2019,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,1," Manila to Iloilo City with Philippine Airlines. This trip was plagued with problems and not worthy of a 4-star experience. Problem #1: We purchased a business class ticket and were notified by email about five hours before the flight departed that the aircraft was changed and no longer has a business class, therefore we were downgraded to Premium Economy. Problem #2: A week before our trip, we purchased extra baggage, as we knew we had more than the baggage limit. When checking in at the airport, the check-in person could not figure out how to accommodate the pre-paid baggage and it took well over one hour for her to figure out how to enter it in the system. We had to wait in the check-in area (where there's no seating) to wait for this to be resolved. Problem #3: We, of course, wanted to be compensated for the downgrade. We were offered both a free ticket to use in 6 months (non-transferrable) and 1500 pesos (roughly US$30 each) in cash. First, we were told that we'd get the paperwork in the lounge. It never came, but right before the aircraft door closed, we were given the vouchers and papers to sign. The person who gave us the papers said we could go to the Iloilo office and get the compensation refund. We waited for 2 hours in that office and they said that they could only use the compensation towards another flight, which was completely different from what the Manila rep told us. After waiting for two hours, we complained to the manager who wouldn't budge. I can understand the ticket not being cash, but the downgrade should have been compensated (as we were told), since we received a service that was lower than our paid ticket."

From boarding which they advised the passengers to stand for ""boarding"" before letting us board the aircraft 20 mins later. ""Light meal"" was defined as only a Cupp Keyk (a small cupcake that can be bought at variety stores) and water/coffee that you will still need to call the attention of the crew to give you one, was so disappointing. Funny thing also, on their inflight magazine they have an advertisment to vote PAL for the Skytrax awards for ""Best Airline"" with the specific instructions on how to do it. I guess it somewhat defeats the purpose of passenger's true opinion."

My wife and I flew from Sydney to Tokyo via Manila. The first flight was delayed by 3.5 hours - an email was sent at 6:03AM the same day to advise of this (which I only received at 7am when I'd already travelled to the airport to be on time for the originally scheduled flight - original flight was scheduled for 10AM). We were rushed through transit at Manila for our Tokyo flight only to sit on the tarmac in the plane for 3 hours! The only update we received was a message from the captain saying we were '5th in line to start taking off' and then about 1.5 hours later, another message saying we were 3rd in line. The crew didn't even bother moving around the cabin until about 2.5 hours in to offer water. Once we landed in Tokyo  the airline advised us that they'd lost my wife's bag! They offered us 5000 yen (about $45 USD) and promised they'd deliver the bag to our hotel by two days later (the one thing they actually did do right!). We arrived after the trains and buses had stopped so we had to fork out over 13,000 yen (around $120 USD) to get to our hotel by taxi by 4am in the morning.  We had similar issues on the return journey from Tokyo to Sydney (via Manila). A 1.5 hour delay in Manila sitting on the tarmac with the same cryptic message of being 3rd in line. First the captain said we'd be taking off in 15 minutes. Then about 45 minutes later, he said we'd be taking off in 20 minutes. The flight attendants were nice enough when the flight was in transit and we could tell it wasn't their fault. But the operations side of this airline is atrocious.  Any normal business would put solving such operational issues at the top of its priority list. It doesn't seem this is happening at PAL unfortunately. "

No apologies from flight crew of the delay, even if the reason is beyond their control. After take-off, FAs distributed inflight snacks, a small cupcake which is down from the better snacks served during previous flights. My ticket was no baggage allowance for the lowest economy bookingcfare. I am not really expecting much from this flight since it is just a 45min flight, it could have been better if the flight experience is beyond normal.

Almost all my flights with PAL since the year started was always at least 2hrs delayed. As for this current flight, we’re delayed for 4hrs. Considering that this was supposed to be an early morning flight, most of the passengers have not even eaten their breakfasts yet, but PAL didn’t even serve food. There were even some senior citizens and a PWD in the flight. The reason the ground crew gave why the flight was delayed is “aircraft maintenance”. I don’t really know how you maintain an aircraft but I do know that these things should be scheduled in advance. By doing so, they should know fairly early that a certain flight will be disrupted because of said maintenance. At the very least, they should not sell tickets for flights that will be affected. Scheduling aircraft maintenance an hour before a flight shows how poorly this airline is being managed. It would have been okay if there are other airline options, but no, we’re stuck with PAL. Considering that the flight is 4hrs delayed, I asked if I could be transferred to another flight that’s early, even to be downgraded to economy or to another airline but they couldn’t. I guess the other flights are full and of course, those with connecting flights need to be given priority. With the poor quality of service that Philippine Airlines is showing recently, I don’t think it deserves the 4 star rating that it was previously awarded with."

Booking website didn't work well for me and Check in wasn't possible online. At the airport, on a single ticket I could not check through both sectors, even though my luggage could. NAIA T2 was a horrible place to wait. It felt more like a bus terminal than an airport, minimal facilities and extremely uncomfortable. No pay per visit lounge either. Did not have my beverage selection on first drinks. Meal selection ran out before the cart was half way down the plane. Nothing worth watching on inflight. Wifi ran out before I'd used it - somehow after I'd switched it on, my phone went through 30MB while it was on standby. Not PAL's fault but a more generous quota would be better. Baggage was left behind and didn't arrive until the net day where I got 10 minutes notice of its delivery. This was my fourth flight sector with PAL on a single reservation. Every flight departed late, shortest delay was 1 hour, longest was 3. Every flight had inadequate stocking of inflight food and beverage.

Also we never received notification of the downgrade. Customer service suggested going to the airport and ask about compensation or upgrade when we check in for our flight. After pushing they said a voucher for the fare difference will be provided at the airport - but these vouchers are only good on PAL. I spent an hour at the PAL ticket office making my case. Did not get any further and was told that I either travel in economy on the 14th, travel on the 15th on the class we paid for or get a refund. They also suggested sending an email to PAL customer care. I sent an email and am still waiting for a reply. Looks like our only option is rebooking on another day. April 11  I called PAL customer service who said they will waive the rebooking fee if we rebook for April 15 a day later than our original reservation. No more compensation because they provided same class of service - it apparently doesn’t matter that it wasn’t provided on the day they were supposed to - this is a huge disappointment.

Again there were no advise what really happened and only announced that there would be delay. There were also no details in terms of providing us food and drinks given that our breakfast was not serve and it is a very early flight. Ground staff should have told us that there no definite time on the delay given the real reason of the technical problem and following after we will be serving decent breakfast. I even approached your ground staff and asked whether you will be serving food and that is the only time they said yes -they only served a small cupcake and juice after 3hrs of waiting from the time we were back in guam airport. They announced that there would be further delay on the flight for another 2 hrs. At this juncture, ground staff should have already started gathering information from the passengers who might have connecting or other flights as the delay is already total of 5 hours.  We were advised to go to the PAL office in the departure area, but only to find out that the office is still closed and we have to wait for it to open.

We waited for another 2 hrs only to find out that if we will not constantly follow up our names no accommodation will be provided to us. I have to literally insist that our names be included on the hotel bookings. We are offered to stay in a lousy hotel while other passengers are able to get 5 star hotel. There is also been no advise on how will be the food arrangements on the hotel. Ground staff have inconsistent answers some are saying full reimbursement, while the rest it is via travel vouchers."

On this route staff provided service with lots of smile. Lunch was choice between beef & fish. My hope for Philippine Airlines is to change the aircraft they are using on the route to A330 with 2x4x2 seating configuration as against 3x3x3 which is so cramped in this 9.5 hours journey.

The crew were fast and efficient in performing their job with smiles. In between meals, they offered passengers drinks. The flight was about 9.5 hours in total we were given 2 hot meals and snacks consisting of chocolates, cupcakes, small pack of dried mango, etc.  Also, good job to the pilot for the very smooth landing at MNL Airport."

Boarding at PAL is a long queue at the tube because people get stuck in that area due to the lack of discipline at the boarding gate where the staff just let people in irregardless of seat number. The grouping has no time space in between, so the passengers crowded even the plane aisle."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Coron to Cebu,March 2019,3.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1.0,no,1,"  Coron to Cebu. Lots of small letters in the conformation. While booking I choose the 20kg check-in baggage. When we arrived at the airport of Coron the guy behind the counter was telling us that we only could check-in 10kg. I showed him the tickets and told him we payed for 20kg,  he told us that we were only allowed to take 10kg per person because we would fly with a small aircraft or we had to pay 200 philipino peso per kg. After calling his manager she showed us a sentence in our confirmation that said that if you fly with a small aircraft it is only 10kg check in baggage. I think it is ridiculous that they let you pay for 20kg and when you are checking in the baggage you have to pay again a ridiculous amount of money. We had to pay 7800peso (4 pax), 2 times the ticket price and 135euro."

My family had an early flight on 18 February PR214. So at check in we discovered that we were in excess in our baggage (fault admitted). The PAL ground crew advised us that we had to remove things, but not in a way that sounded like she cared. So were told not nicely to move elsewhere and fix it, causing stress to myself and family - bearing in mind this was around 4am in the morning. We eventually repacked and she then proceeded to refuse to seat us together said she couldn't or didn't want to do it. She kept citing baggage regulations about weights - nowhere was a sign that said what was the weight for each type of baggage apart from the 25kg (not even on the website) you need to fix this. This was a disappointing start to our holiday, partly caused by someone who obviously didn't want to be there judging by the fact she didn't smile at all - her colleagues seem to manage it! The rest of our journey was acceptable but this experience reflects badly on PAL."

This is a 45-minute flight and was served snacks on board which was a good gesture. Ticket price was average since I purchased my ticket almost 2 weeks before travel. All in all it was flight nothing to write home about and expected from PAL which didn't disappoint. As always crew were doing their job well."

The flight was very full so I could not pick the seats that I wanted. The checkin process had very long lines. Thankfully, because our flight was about to depart, the staff allowed us to cut in. The boarding was very fast and efficient. But the plane took very long to depart, we were waiting for almost 1 hour before we started moving. Service was always superb though. The food was hit and miss. One option was very bland while the other was tasty. I was able to sample both because I got really hungry and asked for another serving. The entertainment was just okay. Screens were responsive but most of the movies available I've watched already. Seats were very comfortable for a short flight, I was able to take a good nap."

Pre Departure Gate at Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 1 is a Chaos. This is always a problem. Ground staff should put Boarding Group in a well organized manner like in Toronto so that people should know and start to line up if they will able to see a Boarding Group line from A- C. Pal should also allow passengers to bring a bottled water with them. Like in Toronto Airport passengers bound for Manila are allowed to bring bottled water. 3X to go for security checked is a big hassle knowing that at the final security before boarding a bottled water is not allowed. Aircraft leave on time. Pilot and its crew are awesome informing ahead of a turbulence might encounter. Flight attendants are friendly and nice and inflight meals are delicious. But Inflight Entertainment like movies are only few to select hope Pal would upgrade its movie selections. Overall my experience was okay.

I flew from Melbourne on a brand new A350. Check in and boarding was on time and easy. Leg room was equal to the best I’ve experienced.

This is the third time flying Premium Economy with Philippine Airlines. This time the Premium Economy was fully booked without an empty seat, which is unusual for me since whenever I flew before there were only a few seats occupied. Nothing was to different this flight (Honolulu - Manila only) except the food. The food was very average airplane food. This is different for me flying PAL. PAL usually has really good food, but it seemed the food was sparse and not so good. Also, although most of Prem. Eco. were given bread, some of us were not. The flight was great as usual."

I usually fly Philippine Airlines to the Philippines. I have never been on a flight where their LAX-MNL or MNL-LAX flights were not full. This flight was fully because it was after the holidays and people were going back to LA. Our flight was delayed due to late arrival of the plane from another destination but within an hour, we were boarding. Flight attendants were nice, attentive and helpful. I noticed that there was more legroom on this plane. Maybe because it was a newer B777-300ER. The food was good, the IFE was great with many selections and fast response with regards to the touch screen. Overall, it was a great flight. Most likely we will fly them again due to the accessibility of connecting flights once you get to Manila. I must say, PAL has improved their services since I last flew with them 3 years ago."

After 2 times delayed, the flight was announce cancelled at 2230 & I was stranded with my 2 kids. I requested a hotel room but they said all are fully booked & they just put me and the other passengers in the lounge with no proper place to sleep. We cannot have a shower because there is no shower room inside. After so many calls to PAL office in Dubai, me & my kids can fly using PAL PR659 25th December at 1945. Due to 3 hours delayed we arrived at 1045 and the PAL staff said the flight from Manila to Kuala Lumpur was already full, they give us flight at 1720 using MAS. Because it is another airline we have to go to other terminal (the terminal of our arrival only for PAL) So we had to check out from immigration & claimed our luggages & check in again at other terminal. When we want claim our luggage we just realized that our luggage was not in our flight. It's still in Dubai and they asked me to lodge luggage delay report and said that my luggages will be send to Kuala Lumpur with PAL flight from Manila. So we travel to Kuala Lumpur with no luggages and when arrived at KL I have to lodge another report to make sure my luggages will be sent to me directly. "

On one flight, there was no in-flight entertainment. Food was abysmal.  Then, there's the layover at the Manila airport that does not reflect any of the standards of a basic airport. For one, we spent a fair bit of time trying to locate the departure screen because our gate seemed to have changed 15 minutes before boarding. Staff on the ground were unwilling or unable to help, saying, just listen out for an announcement. Eventually we found a 30"" screen perched above some kind of stand that was not obvious at all and not at eye level for a screen that tiny. And if you have a long layover, it's best to pack your own food and drink."

Flight out was really nice, delays and ‘cattle-car’ boarding were acceptable, food was unique and enjoyable, staff was perfect. Flight back was bumped and atrocious, delaying departures for days, for an apparent overbooking error that they never wanted to deal with or accept. Customer service was blatantly ignored and everyone was very politely adept at kicking the can to the next destination. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to London,January 2019,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes,8,"  Manila to London. I flew out on the 29th December to Manila, and returned on 10th January to London. The journey out was faultless. It was a new plane and I was incredibly impressed. The return journey was again a new plane. There were a few small issues on the return. We were held for a 1 hour delay on the plane before take off. The entertainment system had lots of problems coming back, and had to be fully plane rebooted twice on the journey. A pity because it's now a great system with a big screen, and a wide variety. However despite these grumbles, I wanted to compliment Philippine Airlines on the fantastic improvement in the plane quality. The staff have always been friendly and helpful in previous years, now the planes match it.  Food served was of a good standard. No complaints at all. Will happily travel with them again."

BKK-MNL  started with a notice to say the flights is delayed by 40 mins so no big deal but then no board updates which turned into an 8 hour delay and 11 hours at the airport finally we were allowed to board. And after a 3+ hour flight and just 10 mins to touchdown in Manila they tell us there is a runway closure and we have been diverted to another airport in Clark and are not allowed to get off. This is not the first time a flight has been diverted from Manila to Clark so does PAL have both memory loss not to learn from these previous diversions. So they let us off and then put us in a waiting room with no representative from PAL anywhere in sight. Even the captain made no announcements from the flight deck and left the cabin crew with angry passengers and no way to explain.  Immigration closed/sleeping in Clark so they won’t give us luggage to make own arrangements and are making us wait another 4 hours to force us to fly back to Manila at 6am. "

The seats are a little bit wider and they recline a little bit more than regular economy. Food portions were greatly reduced from past flights. The food quality is still very good, but the quantity is much smaller. Also, some passengers were not offered bread rolls for some reason. The flight was very smooth and nice, which is kinda normal for this Jan. time of year. And as usual, the crew was outstanding and professional"
✅ Trip Verified ,A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Manila,December 2018,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,3.0,3.0,yes,8,"  Bangkok to Manila. The Manila-bound flight with PAL went smoothly. Definitely there was an improvement in the FA's manner of dealing with the passengers. The food was delightful, like getting a preview of one might look forward to dining in the Philippines. The IFE selection was a little limited, hope it was because it was a 3-hour flight only. Aircraft looked and smelled clean. Arriving at the NAIA Centennial Terminal is a different story, of course but for the sake of giving goodwill as it was almost Christmas, I shall keep this to myself and hope that they can recognize that there is a big room for improvement. Flight fantastic, cannot complain at all. Manila Airpor- needs improvement in many aspects. Will continue to fly with PAL whenever I can as I would like to see if they manage to sustain the big improvements they have had after such a long time of being in the doldrums of flight comfort and customer service."

This trip was my first time flying with Philippine Airlines and I was pleasantly surprised. The flight from Bangkok to Manila was originally scheduled to be an A350 however this was changed to a 77W. The aircraft was very clean and well maintained, my only issue was that it had a 3-4-3 configuration rather than a 3-3-3. The flight departed and arrived on time. The cabin crew were the best that I have experienced on any airline, they were polite and courteous, and present throughout the entire flight. After a tight connection in Manila, my Singapore flight both departed and arrived early. Service on this flight was also excellent and the A321 utilised was fine for a route of this length. I would not hesitate to use Philippine Airlines again."

The seats were comfortable that I dozed off in few minutes after take-off. Food was tasty but the crew did not make rounds for coffee/tea. I didn't like much the staff assigned in our cabin because she seems to be rushing always. Overall, it was uneventful. The new aircraft was great!"

Cabin looks clean and fresh, comfortable seat, IFE is amazingly easy to manipulate, cant fault it with several movies/entertaining vid tv clips to choose from. Flight crew is helpful up to certain level, I think they can do more. Food not bad but can be better. Check-in very good, orderly, excellent ground staff. Easy online booking but free baggage of 25kg/pax is poor when other carriers allowed 30kg. All in all PAL is going a long way improving and striving well in airline industry."

This A321 should not be used on this route because it is 3.5 hrs and you have the number one airline in the world as competitor on this route. The flight was so boring with no entertainment and the space in between seats was cramped. And the cabin crew were unprofessional because despite the fact that I had pressed the call button, they just passed by my row three times until I called them. And the food served was poor. It’s actually like a budget airline."

In-flight entertainment did not work. There was supposedly on-line streaming but was not functioning. In short, no in-flight entertainment for a 3 hour flight. Lesson learned, when flying PAL be sure you have a lot of videos and music available in your gadget. PAL's in-flight entertainment is not reliable."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to San Francisco via Manila,September 2018,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,8,"  Bangkok to San Francisco via Manila. I am a big fan of Philippine airlines. The customer service is outstanding, I am always made to feel very comfortable and the movie selection is great. I would give them a 10/10, if it weren’t for the surprisingly below-average special meal selection. I have been a gluten-sensitive foodie for 7 years. I am not vegetarian. I still eat sugar, salt, spices, dairy, and fat. I have order a GF special meal for the past 3 or 4 trips I’ve flown but I always end up asking for one of the regular meals instead because the GF meals are SO awful. They are completely devoid of all salt, sauces, spices or any flavor, and are so bland that it’s like eating astronaut cardboard food. For example, the last flight I took (Manila-San Francisco), the regular meal options were a chicken sausage dish with some mashed potatoes and veggies, a wonderful colorful julienne vegetable salad, a flan pudding (GF by nature) and some bread with butter. The other option was a delicious smelling pork belly over rice (seriously some of the best pork belly I’ve ever had) and some veggies with the same sides. Everything was gluten-free except for the bread roll and looked much more colorful and fresher overall. By contrast, the GF “special” meal that I received was a plain chicken breast with no salt, steamed veggies that were overcooked and mushy to the point of colorless baby food, with no spices or sauces, a watered-down fruit salad, a rice cake with no butter and a banana instead of dessert. I was amazed at how bland and flavorless it was. Gluten-free does not mean sugar-free, low-fat, or dairy free. It simply means the absence of wheat flour. I still like sauces and spices. And I still like butter. A non-fruit dessert would have been nice. And since when does gluten-free mean flavor-free? I would have preferred the regular meal option with just a gluten-free rice cake substitute. Thank god they had extra regular meals for me to eat instead. Point being, if you’re not extreme celiac and just gluten-sensitive, I recommend ordering off the regular menu and just omitting the bread roll. The flavorless meal isn’t worth it!"

Leather seat cover is uncomfortable. Barely minimum in-flight service for a 3 hour flight. No blankets were given but instead they made cabin temperature warm so it was not comfortable even. No in-flight entertainment in the A321. Food serving too scant. Meal service is not generous compared to other Asian airlines. Staff friendly indeed. Overall service is rather mediocre.

To ensure that we are seated next to each other in the area we want, we paid for seats. This is a long flight (approx 14 hrs non stop) from Manila to London so it is very important to us where we sit. To our horror we found out at check in that PAL has already given away those seats and we have been displaced to separate seats. I had to demand for them to find at least seats next to each other. They did eventually do so but with no sign of any understanding of the inconvenience this caused. Those were paid for seats. We actually paid to have designated seats."

The flight from Heathrow was good, the inflight entertainment worked and apart from an odd egg panini the food was OK. However on the way back a Xiamen Airplane crash landed at Manila, closing the runway. We were in terminal 2 in Manila, Philippine Airlines own terminal. We arrived around 10am over 3 hours before our flight was to depart. We noticed a couple of flights had been cancelled but though nothing of it as they allowed us to go through Check In, Security and Passport Control. It was whilst we were waiting in the departure lounge we were told our flight was cancelled and were told to stay put. About an hour later we were told to go to the ticketing office, this was the last communication we received. We then left the departure lounge where we queued for over 10 hours, being offered no food or water. We did not know if we were in the right queue, everyone we asked didnt know.  When we finally got to the check in area we found airport staff had been cutting into the front of the line with several passports taking priority over the people who had been queuing over 10 hours. The girl at the desk didnt know how to use the computer and kept having to ask for assistance. We were told our only option was wait 5 days for the next flight or to turn up each day and be added to a lottery for any spare seats that might arise. I asked to be put on a different airline but was refused. I asked for help with a hotel, also refused. By now it was almost midnight, we had not eaten since we left our hotel around 9 am and were now stranded in Manila for 5 days. Eventually we found a hotel, although that is a different story. We did fly back 5 days later, however the inflight entertainment didnt work properly. The food was adequate, slightly more edible than the food on the way there. I felt let down by Philippine Airlines and all my protestations since have been met with claims that it was not their fault. The Xiamen airline crash may not have been their fault, how we were treated at Manila Airport was. We had no information, no food, no water, no accomodation and no help. "

This was not a one off experience as the service we received from our flight to Puerto Princesa, Palawan and our return flight back to Melbourne on 14 Sept 2018 were exceptionally good as well. PAL had gone a long way from the ground support all the way to the food selection and cabin service which made our trips a memorable one. Apart from no inflight entertainment on our flight to Manila only (thankfully we did get one on our return trip to Melbourne) this did not deter us from giving a higher rating to PAL. May we also commend the pilots for a near perfect Take Off & Landing of our planes. Congratulations PAL!

The flight left Manila and arrived into Riyadh on time. The arrival time to Riyadh has always been my preference for taking this airline. Flight attendants service was excellent. Food was above my expectations. And finally, passengers in the economy class were reminded to use the lavatory in their area and never use the premium economy section lavatory as economy passengers queue at the lavatory thus hindering the flight attendants access to the galley and the back part of the plane. All in all, PAL has always delivered well in this sector. The airline has improved a lot and keeping up its 4 stars status."

They never called, text, or emailed me to coordinate the status of my bag or to ask me if they can assist me with anything or just simply apologize for their big mess up.

I got a $20.00 food voucher. I had to use it in Toronto. I bought a burrito and a chocolate milk. I also lost one days vacation. It took 4 hours to check baggage in because they didn't have enough staff for the amount of people. Yes you can check in online but you still need a printed boarding pass because they do not accept digital boarding passes. I was supposed to leave Manila Aug 17 but due to an accident the airport was closed and all flights were cancelled. We were told by PAL staff (after hunting them down) to call the booking number to re-book the flight. I had to book a hotel. I tried calling PAL. After two hours I was finally able to talk with someone. They told me that it was only to book new flights not for re-booking and I had to go to airport to get a new flight. Aug 18 I went. There was zero customer service by PAL at the airport. After spending 16 hours there I left and got a hotel. I went back Aug 19. They kept telling me that the next available flight was Aug 31 and I had to wait until then. I spent 18 hours there and after a very long day I finally got a boarding pass. I was suppose to leave Aug 20 at 8:00 AM. Meanwhile they were flying out the regular scheduled passengers for all the other flights for Aug 18, 19, 20 The people from the 17th were still waiting to fly out. I boarded the plane again at around 9:30 - 10:00 AM We took off at Noon. They would not give us any accommodations or food. They kept saying ""fault majeure"" meaning it's not their fault. I agree that Aug 17 was not their fault but Aug 18, 19, 20 was their fault. I had to pay for three extra nights in a hotel. Taxis back and forth to airport, food. I also lost two days of work. According to the passengers bill of rights they are suppose to provide accommodation, food or put us on another airline. But they would not take responsibility. I sent PAL three emails. They never replied to any of them. I sent them messages on messenger and all they do is say we are looking into it. Sorry for the delay. We apologize. So sorry.

The plane was late arriving at LAX, so we were late leaving for Manila. We had to circle the airport for an extra hour before landing because traffic was backed up. The passengers connecting to the Denpasar flight were herded via shuttle buses to the next plane. The doors closed shortly after, but we stayed parked at the gate for another hour before moving to the runway. That was important, because the seven of us were the only ones not to get our luggage when we landed in Bali. We were again 1.5 hours late and it was now 2 am. The agent told us to return the following night at 1am. to retrieve our bags. I explained that I had a flight to another island at noon and it was their responsibility to send my bags along on a domestic flight. They did not send them. All my clothes and all my dive gear for a week on a dive boat sat in the airport for 8 days. I had to scramble to buy a few items of clothing before leaving on the boat.  I have been in contact with the airline several times, insisting that they cover the costs I incurred. They had 36 hours after my bags got to Bali to send them on to me before I was unreachable. I couldn't even reach the luggage agent who gave me his phone number, even though I was calling from 1:30 - 4a.m. when he should have been retrieving my bags. I also could not reach Manila, and finally asked my boyfriend in the U.S. to find out where my bags were. I was afraid they would be tossed after 8 days in lost and found.  My bags were waiting for me when I returned to Bali, but I spent almost $400 in dive rental and basic purchases. And to add one last irritation, my row of seats on the 13.5 hour returning flight from Manila to LA had no power. We had no screen to watch movies, no light to read by, not even a working attendant call light. The purser apologized for our lack of power and gave us miles on PAL, as if I would ever fly their airline again."

Between Melbourne and Manila I had the newly refurbished A330-300. This has a comfortable 2-4-2 seating layout in Y with modern IFE and WIFI. The flight crew were very attentive, cheerful and approachable. The IFE selection is sufficient and the aircraft was like new inside. My only gripe was the return red-eye flight MNL-MEL where we were not supplied with pillows which made the flight a bit uncomfortable. My flights between Manila and London were operated on the B777 with again excellent flight crews on both sectors, and punctual service. Food was plentiful and of a good quality on all sectors, with crew making regular drinks/water runs and happy to refill water bottles. The 777s on both flights had slightly cramped by very comfortable and well-padded seats (3-4-3 in Y). The only sour point was that on both 777 sectors I had broken/damaged seats (first flight had a seat stuck in upright position, second sector the audio jack was broken in my armrest. If they give these aircraft a bit of an overhaul I think they'll be up to standard with airlines like Qantas etc. Overall I found this airline to be much improved over the past years, and a much friendlier experience than other carriers like Singapore Airlines. I think with their new A350s they will be a very solid choice for my next travels between Manila and London."

When we confirmed with baggage handling service that handles Philippine Airlines, they told us that 40 baggage were left at Manila. We had to wait 2 days to get our baggage. While returning, again the flight was delayed by 1 hrs. we had only 1.5 hrs of transit at Manila and the flight was delayed by 1 hrs and there is a unique system in Manila airport that you need to present your boarding pass to transfer desk, stamp it and only then allowed to go through security. We were lucky to get in front of line and get on our plane right at the end of boarding time. Don't expect personal entertainment system in the plane as most of the plane do not have them. In addition, board the aircraft as soon as possible and ask for the blankets because they have very limited amount of blankets. "

The first of the flight was on an Airbus but had no screens in the seats. Ground crew handed out flyers with instructions on how to download the my pal app for your phone or tablet. If you do fly with this airline it’s important to find out if it has got inbuilt flight equipment. The other thing that you might find annoying is that there was nowhere to charge my device on this aircraft. The leg room was quite spacious for economy and the food was very good. The Manila to London leg was on a newer Boeing 777 that did have inbuilt inflight entertainment but less legroom in economy. Again the food was good for airline food and the staff friendly and helpful. I would have no problem flying Philippine airlines again but remember to download the app for entertainment and by a power bank to keep your devices charged.

My flight on PR103 scheduled to depart at 00:05 was canceled when a ground vehicle accidentally hit the aircraft's wing. All passengers were then asked to go back to the check in counters and there I stood in line for over 3 hours with some 300 passengers in front of me and only 3 persons staffing the counters. No refreshments offered. No hotel accommodation either, I was told to take a seat and wait until 08:00 in the morning when the counters will reopen so I can get my boarding pass for the next available flight to Manila. By 8 in the morning, I was already checked in for PR113 to MNL departing at 12:30pm, but was told that my luggage will have to be delivered to my home address in the Philippines as they could not load it on the same flight that I will be on. Over 15 hours of no food, no water, no sleep and not a single apology from any ground staff. 2 days after arriving Manila, my luggage is still not delivered. So I called their baggage tracing services department and was told that my luggage should be on their way. I gave it another 2 days and I still did not receive them, so I tried my luck by calling their cargo department to see if they may have my luggage, true enough, they did - but told me that they don't do deliveries so I will have to go to the airport to collect them myself. I also purchased front row seats for $30, but they could not provide one after putting me on a different flight after the cancelation. So I emailed their refunds department to request for a refund and here is the response that I received - ""Upon checking on the record, we are unable to refund it since it is already on used status. You may try to email your request/complaint but it will be subject for investigation and approval."" Filipinos are warm and caring people. It is a shame that this airline claims to be the heart of the Filipino when it is run by horrible heartless people."

I always like to do online check-in so I won’t spend so much time on the airport lining up and it was not a pleasant experience. They were taking ages to email the boarding passes. With that said I don’t recommend doing it at night if you're like me who wants to make sure that it’s in your inbox. I thought I secured my seat that I want but they changed the aircraft last minute which I don’t mind as long as they give me another window seat. That was not the case. I complained but they told me it was an “equivalent to what you selected” and I trusted them and they lied. They gave me a middle seat instead of a window seat. I don’t know if they’re just being lazy or they just didn’t know too like myself. I was also travelling with my family and on the plane, I found out that we were seated far apart from each other. We were one of the very few families and all people seating around our own rows are strangers to one another. Maybe they could figure out how to seat groups together next time. It triggers me a lot thinking that all the work I did to check in online prior to the flight was a complete waste of time. The cabin crew were great though. They were far better than the ground staff and it would have been such a pleasant experience if not for what happened at the airport. Everything else was up to standards but I think the airport experience (on the ground service) still plays a big role."

The flight crew from AKL to MNL were friendly, introduced themselves, knew our names, and was on top of service. There wasn't a lot of us in the section so it was pretty quiet. The food was good too. The domestic leg's food wasn't commendable. The fish looked dry and old but service was still great. The return flight to AKL was less noteworthy. Being in business class means faster boarding but the girl at the gate seemed confuse. Economy was quicker. Business class this time had more people and the crew wasn't as warm. Had a bit of the tired attitude. They didn't personally introduce themselves nor as warm, and service was average. The A330 triclass is great though.

PAL has an annual 50% off sale for miles redemption and i was lucky enough to secure enough points prior to the sale. The drawback is that I needed to go to a PAL ticketing office just to process the ticket which is a little bit inconvenient. However, the service that I had experienced on board is really amazing and that compensates to the drawbacks. PAL flies from NAIA Terminal 2. The airport is a little bit congested, very few shops are available and there is nothing to do in the airport while waiting. The Mabuhay Miles Lounge offers a very limited variety of food and drinks. The check-in experience is fast as there was a counter which was intended for all business class passengers. The queue on the immigration on the other hand is a little bit chaotic as there were only few immigration officers intended for a lot of passengers. There was no priority lane intended for business class as well. PAL's new business class utilized Vantage XL seats which are very spacious and comfortable. it has a direct aisle access and can be converted into a full flat bed. The seat was amazing but not so private. The meals were great, so were the champagne and the wines. FAs were caring and sensitive to needs of passengers."

I was left disappointed mainly with the food offering on this short regional flight (2.5 hours). The meal looked more akin to budget airline food. There was no salad, no bread, just chicken patty with some vegetables and potatoes (or rice, I don't recall). Service was great, however, in fairness to the flight attendants serving on this flight. They greeted passengers warmly with a big smile on their faces. That is probably the thing that was 4-star on this flight. The IFE using their PAL in-air flight app worked well. Good that I was able to download the app prior to flight departure. They should announce this well ahead of time (perhaps at check-in) otherwise, passengers wouldn't be able to access the app during the flight.

I wonder what makes it Premium Economy compared to regular economy. The difference is unnoticeable."

If they miss your luggage which they did mine you have no chance to talk to any call center worker. They forgot my luggage and I waited almost an hour around carousel and I went to luggage service dept and they told me the airline forgot my luggage in London.  They don’t have any customer service here in Australia and you need to call to Philippines. I called them 20 times without any information regarding whereabouts my luggage.

Flight arrived an hour early, once cleared immigration, bags were already lined up beside the carousel. The only hitch for this flight is the economy class passengers are using Premium Economy lavatory, which causes long queues and sometimes loud conversation disrupting sleep in the last row.

I frequently fly for business and pleasure. I use United domestically in the US and Cathay Pacific for trips to Asia. I recently scheduled a trip with Philippine Airlines direct to Manila from San Francisco and have never experienced a poor level of customer service. I repeatedly advising the sales representative at purchase that I would arrive in San Francisco airport 12 hours in advance of the flight to Manila. As such, access to the lounge for business class travelers would be essential for me. I was repeatedly assured that the business class lounge would in fact be available. Upon arrival in San Francisco airport, I was advised that the lounge was not open and that the personnel of the airline would not arrive until three hours before departure. Upon calling customer service, I was put on hold for approximately 2 hours waiting for assistance only to be told that my earlier call to purchase the tickets was reviewed and that the representative confirmed access to the lounge as I requested. Nothing further could be done. I complained to the business manager upon check-in and received no response. I was, however, told that a complaint would be forwarded to customer care which in fact was never done. Upon departure from Manila back to San Francisco in business class many of the seats simply did not work to adjust position. Passengers in business class were left to scramble to find seats that actually adjusted. Those who did not find a workable seat were left to request the staff to manually adjust the seats in business class. I have attached photos of the attendants manually adjusting seats that otherwise did not work at all. One of the attendants agreed with me that the seats were nothing short of horrible."

They only use 1 boarding gate for 3 or 4 different flights with the same time. If one flight gets delayed, all flights that are using the same gate will get delayed as well.  Even though their flight is already delayed, they don’t try their best to speed up the boarding procedure. This happens a lot of times. They keep use NAIA’s air traffic as an excuse for their delay but in my opinion the delay is caused by their boarding procedure."

On flight day departure was delayed by 1 hour but at least passengers were compensated by a £7 refreshment voucher. Flight went well although due to the flight changes of PAL i was not able to sit together with my family. Good thing PAL used a newer version Boeing 777 with wider entertainment screen and seat chat feature! Seat Chat was amazing as I was constantly chatting with my 7 year old daughter seated at the rear of the plane. It kept her entertained. Food was okay but I had better food choices from my MNL-LHR flight 2 weeks prior. Flight staff were kind and attentive especially the male senior flight purser. I observed that he was very attentive and cheerful to all passengers especially to senior citizen passengers and to children. Landing was smooth as expected of PAL flights

I have flown this flight numerous times to get to Cebu City via Manila as there are not many other options. Pal now have a direct flight from BKK to Cebu City but it leaves in the middle of the night so it is not an option. Booking online with PAL is not easy. My final destination is Cebu City and it is almost impossible to get a good connection in Manila as PAL gets the time of the flight from BKK to Manila wrong. They list it as a 4.30 hour flight and it is a 3.30 hour flight.  I paid for a better seat choice near the front of economy but it turned out the flight was almost full so people that did not pay were sitting net to me which is unfair but that is how it goes. The major upgrade to this flight is now after years of complaining they do have in-seat tv's on the flight. This is nice and the selection was not too bad. The internet on board was slow. They do not offer a fish choice, only chicken and pork.  They have a good selection of drinks to choose from. Flight attendants were polite and professional and efficient. At Terminal 2 MNL the baggage took over 30 minutes to arrive. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Cebu to Bangkok,April 2018,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,2.0,no,4,"  I wanted to try the new direct flight from Cebu to Bangkok that started recently and choose business class to see what services were offered. When I arrived to check into the flight there was no line for business class. When I mentioned this to the man checking me he laughed and yelled over to his colleague who said she forgot to light up the sign (she was playing on her phone at the time). I was given a pass to the business class lounge and a special line pass for BKK Immigration. The lounges is not a PAL lounge but an independent that all airlines use. It was OK but in no way special. The food was disgusting. They had a wine selection and only one brand of beer. Internet speed was slow but usable. Upon boarding the flight there was no special line for business class so I waited with other passengers. It turned out I was the only person in business class. There are 12 seats in this class, 4 per row, which are wider than economy and fairly comfortable but the seats barely recline so there was no way I could sleep on the flight. The tv screen is about the size of a small tablet and the selection was terrible. I was offered a menu with drink and meal selections. The food and wine were poor.  Service was good in the beginning but after about 45 minutes the flight attendants seemed to be eating and chatting and then 4 of them including the flight purser went to sleep in the business class section!  I understood that it was a turnaround flight for them from Bangkok so I guess they needed to rest but I kept thinking what would happen in the event of an Emergency? Hold on passengers we need to wake up the flight attendants and flight Purser! So the bottom line is it was not really worth the extra money for business class on a small plane with PAL. Save it for the larger jets where you can get a seat that reclines more. My luggage arrived in the middle of all other passengers luggage which was disappointing as it should arrive before. Clearly PAL have not worked that out with the baggage handlers at BKK airport. I would put them at 3 star only at this time."

An attendant of PAL approached me as soon as I reached PH and rushed to the next plane. The attendant let me choose if I’d like to ride the plane but my check in bags will arrive the next day for the next flight because the processing is long and it lacked time, OR will ride the next flight together with my bags, and I chose the former. So all I knew was my bags were not on the plane the I rode. Before reaching the destination, I even asked one of the attendants about my bags. Upon arrival, I went to the ticketing/cashier of PAL in SFO (because this is where they directed us to ask abt my baggage) and the attendant told us to return the next day and will inform us when the baggage arrive and the earliest would be @ 10pm. She also gave us a number of PAL to check if my bags have already arrived the next day. We waited for the message or call from PAL about my baggage but received none. So I tried calling the number of PAL that was given to me from 10-11pm. Around 11pm, a man from PAL talked to me through phone telling me that the baggage was on the same plane as I am and was blaming me that I didn’t picked it up. No one informed me from the airlines about it. Different info was relied to me from the connecting flight. So we went to the airport to pick up my bags. Saw the same woman who told us that she’ll inform us as soon as the bags have arrived and found but received neither a single call or message. She was shocked and apologized because she forgot about it. So she got my stub and passport to get my bags. When I saw my bags, one was in good condition and the other was slightly damaged.  I could have gotten my bags only if I knew that it is already there when I arrived but no one informed me and got the wrong info. PAL should be responsible enough to inform their customers the information that they need and deserve."

They do come around with water which I appreciated so much but they try to not glance your way giving me the impression that they don't want to give you any. We waited for 6 hours before they collected the garbage. It ruined the experience for me. I realize that it was a full flight but the service shouldn't change.

However it lacks cabin mode lighting, 1 toilet shared by 18 pax. No amenity kit for business class on this short flight. IFE has no inflight cameras and not interactive 3D map. No pre-landing snack. Wifi cannot connect to the internet in my flight. Overall this business class is way better than business class on Boeing 777 in terms of privacy.

When one of the flight attendants was explaining the exit row manual, I looked at my phone because of a text message and she told me “Sir, your attention please”. The same attendant got my bag and put it on the overhead compartment for me. Coffee, tea, water and a carrot cake were served. After eating my snack, I went to get my laptop and I pressed the attendant’s button to call for help. The chief pursuer came to me and I told her that I can’t find my bag, she then called the same flight attendant who carried my bag a while ago and got my bag from the over-head cabin. She told me it was just covered, not missing. Pal is known for the warmth of its flight attendants but in this flight not. "

There is a very big improvement on the check-in in NAIA Terminal 2 Domestic, the ground staff were very warm-welcoming even though I checked-in at 5 am and there was no line at all! It only took me few seconds to drop my bag and get my boarding pass. I used the Mabuhay Lounge and there was nothing really special about it as compared to Singapore Airlines or Cathay but it also improved a lot the last time I used it. It still has a wide selection of drinks, cakes and other food enough for breakfast. PAL uses the newly reconfigured A330 or A340 to General Santos and luckily we used the newly reconfigured tri-class A330! I was actually disappointed that I didn't upgrade my ticket to business class. The seat in economy was a bit hard but comfortable, leg room was really good, the IFE worked well and has updated movie list (I watched Call Me by Your Name, they also have Coco and other new movies)! Landing and baggage collection in General Santos also went well. No delays, snacks were served (tea, coffee, water and bread). Will definitely recommend Philippine Airlines."

Philippine Airlines is known for its crew hospitality and on this flight, the entire business class crew were very professional and willingly ensured that passenger satisfaction is met. The business section was half full so there was no traffic to the single toilet/lavatory unlike my DMM-MNL flight of 1st March. If there is a room for improvement, I hope PAL will address this by adding one more toilet for the business class section in this sector. Food (2 sets of meals) and amenities (L'Occitane and PAL slippers) were very good. Inflight entertainment (i.e. movies) is quite dated and needs a fresh and newer set of films. Aircraft is an older A330 and the seats could do some upgrading. Overall, I am still satisfied and recommend this airline to my friends and work colleagues. I have already noticed an increase in their internet published fares for business class to which I am hoping that visible improvements commensurate to that projected price hike will take place."

I spoke with the agent, then got transferred to a supervisor who then called their ""backing office"" whatever that office means, who then in turns tells him that too bad, there's nothing they can do for the consequences of their delay.

The only let-down was Manila airport where they use the old terminal which is shabby and where it can be difficult to know here to go and what to do."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300,Business,Business Class,Hong Kong to Manila,February 2018,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,4.0,yes,7," The new seats definitely make a difference for Philippine Airlines flight from Hong Kong to Manila. While the flight was quite bumpy as usual for this route on this time of year. The new seat config had definitely made the flight quite enjoyable. The new configuration also gave all business class seats direct aisle access to the convenience of the passengers. The entertainment system and movie selection was also a big improvement from the old ""bring your own media player to watch"" setups. I do hope that the airlines updates all of the aircraft in its fleet to this new seat configuration."

The flight was delayed by one hour, only through public announcements at the airport they informed us of that. I was advised to carry my big bag on board as the time required to handle the bags in Manila Airport would not be sufficient to make my connecting flight to Istanbul in time. I suggested they give me a seat in the front area of the plane to allow for a quick exit but they gave me a seat in row 60 plus. Upon arrival they did not dock the giant airplane but stopped on the tarmac and used buses. Sure enough, due to my rear seat I was able to use the 3rd bus only. After some additional waiting time on the tarmac I was rushed to a waiting shuttle bus who transfered me to terminal 1 in Manila. Suffice it to say that I boarded my codeshare connecting flight at 22:37 for a 22:40 departure."

Cleanliness - spotless, ample space for legroom, built-in on-board entertainment, food was great and very accommodating staff. Overall we can’t fault it. To be honest I can give more than a hundred percent to the staff who did their level best to please their customer even though there’s one guy on board who been very demanding and rude and very condescending towards Filipino or Asian in general (London - Manila route) Who seated near my place and talking loudly that we could hear him clearly. Oh well after few hours trying to get my nap but been kept waking up because of his voice I then stood up and told him to shut up and be considerate to people around him. Oh well that kept him shut the whole journey. If this guy made a complain against staff because they refused to serve him alcohol after one or too many."

Lack of communication at Tagbilaran Airport which now features zero shops or other facilities. Flight service OK but check-in experience was terrible. Totally disorganized check-in queues and check-in staff would neither honor the baggage allowance under the ticket nor allocate the pre-booked (and paid) Choice Extra Legroom seat. Whilst the hard product is OK (inflight service is largely friendly, plane looks OK, snack service could be improved), the soft part of the product is terrible. PAL needs to start to take its customers seriously. After flight complaint handling again terrible, one month to get the complaint transferred to a handler and another month to ""authorize"" reimbursement of USD5 just does not cut it in today's environment anymore."

I tried to book via PAL website but there's a problem with the payment system, payment won't go through. Called their hotline from Jeddah, which is an overseas call, to avail the low fare. I am an Overseas Filipino Worker therefore, I am exempted from paying the Terminal Fee and PH Travel Tax which can be removed out through their website. But since I was booking through the hotline, I was informed by the agent that they cannot remove these fees once I book through them. I had to undergo the process of refunding these taxes. Moreover, PAL and Travel Tax office are pin pointing to each other as to where will I get the refund, and until now I am still waiting for their responses. Bookings made thru agents/hotline cannot be accessed to their website, not until 24 hours before your departure. So there's no way to confirm your booking online before that. There is no IFE, you have to download their MyPAL Player app to access their IFE.  No amenity kit provided on this leg. The service is okay, though there is not much initiative from the crew (e.g. walk around to offer drinks). Served one full hot meal in an 11-hour flight, the rest are light meals such as crackers and sandwiches. JED-MNL leg delayed by almost 4 hours. Good for me because I am checking the flight status the night before my departure in the morning. The departure time changed 3 times. from 6:40 to 10:00. Flight changes are announced via email only.  I can only recommend PAL if the ticket price is way  low compared to other carriers."

It started off weird at the Manila when the check in person told me that I needed to pay a terminal fee in exchange for my boarding pass. It was cheap so I was fine with it. But I couldn’t figure out where to pay the fee and there was no sign to say where to pay it. I asked a few ground staff and they told me that I don’t need to pay because I’m holding an Australian Passport. But nonetheless they were very friendly and approachable. And one of the ground staff finally helped me out and even walked me to the place where I needed to pay. He waited with me at the line and we had a nice chat. Once it was my turn, he left and wished me good luck to my travels. When I returned to the check in, he gave me my boarding pass. He then asked if I had any glass or breakable objects. I told him I have some souvenirs that might break. And just with that, he placed a fragile sticker on the bag with no hesitation. I was pretty happy and very relieved and confident that my bag’s contents wouldn’t break. Then at immigration, the line was short and there was no wait at all, despite the hundreds, even thousands of people in the airport. The departure hall was small and there was a lot of people. But enough seats and charging ports for everyone and a good wifi connectivity. The plane was new and quiet. No TV but had a streaming service which had a great selection of TV and Movies. Would love to have a tv though but it was a short three hour flight. Would recommend reading the Mabuhay Magazine which includes some very interesting topics and articles. The food was super delicious and big. The staff was very friendly on requests. Overall I loved the experience with PAL. I hope they improve the plane to Singapore to include TV, and then I believe that the flight would be excellent."

Only other means I had was to use the MyPAL chat, and it took someone more than an hour to compute the fare and penalties for the next flight. After more than an hour of waiting the agent told me that someone would call in 5-15 mins. No one called! Had to go through the MyPAL Chat again to follow up and go through the same questions and the agent was double checking the computations. It's another hour to do that and ended up giving me a different computation! "

While the airlines previously had asked us for our email during the online booking, I never received any notice of this delay until we got to the check-in counter of the airport. It took at least another 25 minutes beyond the initial delay before they airline began to board the aircraft. To top things off, while the passengers at the departure area could see in full view the aircraft standing by at the gate a few minutes after the original time, the Pilot makes an announcement of his ""apologies"" for a slight delay due to aircraft turnaround. I realize that occasional delays is the norm these days for air travel but could you make sure to inform the passengers ahead of time and don't give us the canned excuse if the reason of the delay cannot be truthfully given."

Philippine Airlines still have a long way to go to be a 5 star airline. They have to improve their Middle East flights especially the leg room and IFE on Premium Economy and Economy Class. I hope they will also give importance to all OFW’s working in the Middle East by providing a better and excellent service. All Filipinos takes pride when they are flying with Philippine Airlines especially the OFW’s. The airline already did a great job with customer service from ground to on board and the food that they served.

The aircraft needs a retrofitting as it looks old inside as can be seen in its seat interior cover, washroom is leaking at the end row as i am seating at 67C and 66H, individual TV seatback is still the old low quality video monitor. Inflight meals are awesome. Cabin attendants serving in our seat row (tail end row) some are nice and some are lazy.

✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Manila,January 2018,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,yes,8,"  I booked a flight from Perth to Manila via Singapore on Skyscanner, with the Perth to Singapore leg being flown by Qantas and the Singapore to Manila leg flown by Philippine Airlines. I was a bit hesitant to book it especially the two airlines were not codeshare partners and that I thought my bags wouldn’t be transferred all the way to Manila, but the staff in Perth was very comforting that my bags would be transferred and that I just needed to get my boarding pass in Manila. I also called Philippine Airlines by phone before my flight and they also assured that my bags will be transferred. My Philippine Airlines flight was sleepy as the flight departed midnight. When entering the cabin, the plane was obviously new but the seats were made out off synthetic leather and some of the covers were peeling off. But the seats colour was very tranquil and it looks very different which I loved. The blues and the browns were just great colour schemes. The big thing was that there was no inflight entertainment tvs but they had a streaming service which had great shows. It was easy to connect in my laptop but if you’re using your phone, you need to download the app before flight. It would be nice if they gave out iPads and have a holder for it on the back of the seats so it was like a tv, because it was an inconvenience having my laptop and my food on a tiny table. But it’s okay because it was a midnight flight and I didn’t use the IFE much. Food was great, big meal for a 3 hr flight and had ice cream as well. We got given free SIM card vouchers. Staff were friendly. Overall great experience."

From evening departure from RUH to early arrival in MNL, which means one can conveniently catch a connection to any point in the Philippines, especially some local airports have daylight restrictions. As to food, we were served 1 full meal and 2 light snacks with all of them acceptable enough. The only let down for me is the seat configuration and entertainment. The Hi-density config on A330 is not suitable for 10 hrs flight. We're crammed light sardines and the absence of individual tv is a bit of a disappointment. I hope PAL considers upgrading its equipment on this route to give travelers the comfort they deserve for this 10-hour direct flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Angeles to Tagbilaran ,December 2017,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,5.0,3.0,yes,6," I am writing this review to call the attention of the airline. My Angeles to Tagbilaran flight was impressive. It has been a few months since I last flew Philippine Airlines. Big improvements were noticed upon boarding. The cabin may be old but seats were clean and there was bottled water on every seat now. This is far different from the old PAL that I had experienced. However the TAG to CRK flight was a big let down. My seat was dirty, there were left over chewing gum wrapper, contents of the seat pocket incomplete, no bottled water and service was inconsistent. For example, the lady two rows ahead of me was provided with a blanket however when I asked for one, the stewardess said they only provided blankets for international flights. Instead they would lower the cabin temp so that we don't feel cold. The temperature was never adjusted and when I approached a different crew, he gave me a blanket without hesitation. PAL has recently also recently been aggressive advertising the following amenities (food, free luggage allowance, blankets on flights, new seats retrofits, and warm service). Food although present is inconsistent, For example, my CRK to TAG flight say would serve water but return flight did not have this and would instead serve you a small cup of water around 100ml. This far from the food service of other airlines I have flown regionally (eg. SQ). Blankets not available on all flights. Official social media accounts cannot even confirm if they have amenities on specific flights. No listing which routes are served with reconfigured seats. My brother's flight did not have luggage allowance while mine had. Most specific, service and cabin crews are inconsistent on different routes. I love flying the national flag, I hope they improve the consistency of the service whether local or international flight."

✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Guam,January 2018,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,2.0,4.0,yes,8,"  Manila to Guam. Baggage counter line for online check-ins understaffed for the volume of passengers. One of the ground crew told us that it's fine since it's a few hours before our departure.  The flight had two gate changes which weren't announced properly, ensuing confusion. Once boarded, however, the experience is almost perfect. Pleasant background music is played during the boarding process. The seats are nice, even if some of them show signs of wear even if they're evidently less than a year old. My seat won't recline, though it was made up by the travel-pillow like headrest and ample legroom. I couldn't use the in-flight entertainment because I didn't have the phone app. Seat screens are still superior. The food (grilled chicken with rice) is fantastic and I have no complaints with the professional cabin crew. Things that I notice are the priority giving of food to children and explaining that they're pausing service during turbulence. The pilots are top-notch: the landing one of the smoothest I experienced for a while. Would recommend."

Let me start by saying that I have been taking flights between London and Auckland (return) for the past 9 years. I always try to take different routes so I can experience different stopovers and different airlines. The first leg from Auckland to Manila was on the A340 and was a terrible experience. I have never been on a long haul flight which didnt have an entertainment system (TV screens in the seat in front) until I flew on this aeroplane! The plane appeared to be very old and run down, very old style seats which were uncomfortable. There was no legroom at all for me (I am 6' or 1.80m tall) my knees were jammed into the seat in front. They handed out iPads for passengers to use to view movies on the 10 hour flight, however they didn't hand these out until we were 3 hours into the flight and then collected them back about 1 hour before landing. The service on the flight was very average with little or no effort made by the cabin crew, we were required to keep walking down to the kitchen to ask for water which was handed out 1 cup at a time. The staff gave the impression that they were constantly annoyed at being asked for anything. Conversely on the second leg from Manila to London we were on a new B777. This flight was much better, entertainment system, quieter, more comfortable, acceptable leg room, however the service from the cabin crew was still very poor. Overall if Philipine Airlines improved their crew service and plane fleet they would be an acceptable option in the future. Until this happens - I will be avoiding it."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Guam to Manila,December 2017,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,yes,6,  Guam to Manila. The seats we had in economy were slightly cramped but adequate. Maybe due to the early morning schedule of the flight the inflight meals seem worse than normal. In flight crew were excellent but the ground crew at check-in were slow to get the passengers processed. As a matter of comparison there were other flights that morning by other airlines operating much larger aircraft and yet our queue was more than twice as long as the other airlines. Overall the experience was good and I would recommend this airline.

My flight went well though there is a slight 10 minute delay. In flight snacks is good. Free baggage allowance is also a big add on. The only thing lacking is the absence of Inflight entertainment system. MyPAL player mobile application is a good alternative though but it is not applicable on all flights / aircraft. I will continue to fly with PAL to the coming days and years.

I chose Philippine Airlines as their price return during the Christmas / New Year period was too good to refuse. I wasn't too sure what to expect as I hadn't heard too much about them and the price was so low. I was impressed - friendly staff, clean interior, good food, a great selection of in- flight entertainment, and their connecting times in Manila were perfect, less than 3 hours.

The check in from NAIA T2 was smooth plus the boarding time. The legroom was ample and just enough for an hour and a half flight going to Taipei. The food was okay and I was able to ask for another glass of water and apple juice which is a plus! The fare really was value for money with free 30kgs baggage allowance. I was able to use my phone to access free movies with their myPAL. I will fly Philippine Airlines again.

I found the seats to be very comfortable and the flight, although an hour late taking off from Manila, landed only slightly late at Heathrow. Our luggage arrived very quickly, just as we arrived to collect it off the belt. The only negatives were the food, which was ok, but nothing to write home about, and the cabin temperature, which alternated between either too cold or too warm. For the price I paid though, and the fact that it was a direct flight, I was pleased with my choice of airline and would fly Philippine Airlines again"

The booking was done in advance. In 1 month ofter the booking was completed, I got an e-mail that my flight USU MNL was rescheduled and it will depart 2 hours earlier. That is not a big deal. In 2 weeks more I got another email, saying that both flights are canceled and I'm rebooked to the flight departing from CRK airport which is 85km from Manila (transfer from Manila or any kind of compensation was not provided). The links, provided in e-mail are not working. On-line access to my booking didn't work either. Customer service phone was never answered. The only thing I could do it to text them using the messenger on web site. So they agreed to cancel my reservation and make a full refund. The money should be refunded in 30 working days. The price for other companies increased a lot. No compensation or any apologies were not made.  Will never fly with them again."

Online booking is straightforward including add on services. Downside: poor on board flight entertainment, aircraft needs upgrade, crowded, not enough legroom, seat is very uncomfortable. In spite of this it was an enjoyable flight, the flight crew's sincerity delivering their job for safe travel comfort made the difference. Will fly again with Philippine Airlines."

The airline changed our flight for the 4th time since booking, and 3 days before we are due to depart (I understand that these things happen) but they cancelled our connection without letting us know therefore potentially leaving us stranded in Manila. We have now had to change our flight to the 25th, losing money on transportation to and from the airport, messing around family and causing major issues for us in Auckland. Upon our request for compensation / upgrade, they passed us around to various different departments. This took us 4 hours without a result. We are bitterly unhappy with the lack of communication, consideration and organisation. This has been an awful experience, one I wish to never repeat."

Check in both at London and Manila abysmally slow, not enough staff. PAL terminal at Manila very badly signed, and gate waiting area had no water or toilets so had to go out and back through security. Plane from Manila freezing cold, airline staff could, or would, not remedy. No entertainment on this plane, on two 4-5 hour flights. Took us 5 days to get home, completely exhausted. After complaining, offered flying points (which we were probably entitled to anyway), and then refused to answer. Never again."

✅ Verified Review ,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Manila,November 2017,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no,6,"  Flew San Francisco to Manila with Philippine Airlines. The seat I picked was 39G. On the seat map it gave no indication that this seat was unable to recline due to being against the lavatory wall, and in fact gave no indication that it was near the lavatory at all. The legroom was terrible and the seat cushion had almost no padding left. It’s safe to say it was a very uncomfortable 13+ hour flight. I remember my lower back hurting for days afterwards. If you are 6 feet or more it would be better to book preferred seating as their leg room leaves something to be desired."

✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Auckland via Cairns,October 2017,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,2.0,1.0,no,1," This was by far the most uncomfortable flight we have ever been on. Initially our seat was changed from row 54 to row 34. After boarding I checked where row 54 would have been but the rows stopped before that, so that means that the plane was changed to accomodate a smaller customer count. This would be fine but he seats that we were assigned to did not recline as it would have blocked the emergency exit. Again, this is understandable. However what isn’t understandable is that the legroom for this seat was significantly smaller than I have ever seen, I am not extremely tall and I could not move my knees in this seat. I have taken images of this. Especially for such a long flight- 6+ hours to Cairns and then another 6 hours to Auckland. There should be a minimum limit on legroom for such long flights. I will never fly with this airline again."
✅ Verified Review ,A330,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Bangkok,October 2017,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4.0,yes,7,"  Bangkok to Manila return in Economy. Efficient, hassle free check in, in both Bangkok and Manila, with a generous free baggage allowance. Both flights were bang on time, with B777 and A330 aircraft used on the route. Both aircraft were comfortable and were equipped with decent IFE, better headphones than some airlines supply in business class and a good range of movies. Crew were polite, efficient and professional. A simple and tasty rice meal was served and the wine was fine. I needed to change my flight booking on the return flight and went to the Philippine Airlines Office in Manila near Harrison Plaza. Service was great and I was able to change my ticket, in a few minutes for a very fair change fee. Philippine Airlines are working hard in recent years to improve their product in terms of quality, reliability and price, and I have to say they're succeeding at least on the routes I fly. Right now the weakest part of their service is having to use NAIA Terminal 2."

From ticketing to check in up to the plane during the flight I must say that Philippine Airlines personnel are very accommodating and hospitable. The lounge was well stocked, crowded at times but is a great place to wait and relax before the flight. Though lounge personnel must always see to it that there are utensils for the guests at all times. Check in was fast with dedicated check in counters for business passengers. Airplane was clean. The food onboard also tasted good. I must say that the airline has gone the extra mile offering full course meal on a domestic flight just one hour long. No IFE onboard. Thought the airplane is equipped with wifi, I haven’t tried using it since the I wasn’t informed that the plane is equipped with wifi. Baggage claim was quick as well. Overall it was a good flight."

✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Caticlan,October 2017,,,,,,,1.0,no,1,  We missed our flight from Manila to Caticlan because the airport was so poorly marked. When we asked the staff to help us they sent us on a wild goose chase with someone who asked us for tips. We then were forced to take a taxi who was a friend of this employee who charged us 15x the regular rate. The airline was unwilling to help or show empathy in any way. Because of the cancelation policies we were forced to pay for this flight and they asked us to pay another $250 USD to take the next flight. Needless to say we booked a different flight through a new airline.

First time flying business class with Philippine Airlines. Seat okay, not very comfortable and not a flat bed. Service was poor despite being delivered with a smile. The remote control didn't work, had many options on menu and was told to choose anything except anything I chose the answer was 'sorry ma'am we have run out of that option'. Dessert time, the ice cream had melted, so that wasn't available either. One steward would take my order and another steward would bring me the wrong food each time. Coffee instead of tea, chicken instead of soup. The cabin space was not well designed with lady next to me havin to climb over me and kicking me each time. Said they had wifi but I couldn't connect to anything. Their lounge had great food, but hot water didn't work on the shower. Not enough seats, had to look around for ages."

The counter staff member on examining my passport asked for my Visa and i had to explain to her that I didn't need one, that I get an automatic visa on entry to which she replied ""oh yeah"". Next issue was that I had no follow on ticket from Manila. I told her that I didn't know the exact date I was leaving and so had not bought a follow on ticket. I also told her that on a previous visit to the Philippines and on my recent trips to the US and Canada, I had no follow on ticket and never had a problem with customs. As I understood it, follow on ticket is an issue for customs not the airline. I checked my luggage, received my boarding pass and headed to the boarding gate. Not long before we were due to board, there was an announcement over the PA system asking me to come to the counter. Same girl is there saying she's talked with her supervisor and that I can't board the flight without a follow on ticket. I'm trying to reason with her and asking why not and she's telling me it's to protect the airline! She offers to sell me a follow on ticket there and then from Manila to Hong Kong for $450, almost the same price as LA to Manila! No Wifi there at the boarding gate so i'm not able to buy a cheap ticket using my smartphone. They ordered by bags off the plane. I walked away quickly trying to find an area with Wifi and managed to buy a cheap ticket before going back and boarding the plane. The flight itself was ok but I'll never fly with them again because of that."

Outbound Riyadh flight was smooth, served 2 full meals and snack and food was good. Departure Riyadh and arrival in Manila was on time. For entertainment, iPads were given to each passenger. FA's were attentive enough to cater to the passengers request. Inbound Riyadh, departure was late for 40 minutes, but arrived Riyadh on time. Service was excellent. Premium Economy section was moved back a bit to give way to the new Business Class section in the front, introduced in the Riyadh route last August. Except for one downside, the economy passengers on the next cabin are using the Premium Economy lavatory which is very inconvenient for our section. Economy passengers has 4 lavatories in their section and too lazy to go there. If only the airline can close the side of the galley so that economy passengers are discouraged to use the Premium Economy lavatory - it will be much more quieter and not withstanding the queue at the back of row 24 E/F/G. Otherwise, the service, flight and crew are perfect."

Chose Business on PAL as only non stop and 13-14 hour flight to Manila from London. Both flights were delayed, though outward flight arrived on time, with no explanation to passengers waiting in the departure lounge. Cabin fell short of expectations on both flights: looked old, cramped and seats were not comfortable. Aisle seats became impassable once they were fully reclined! Had to watch film from a tablet, with very limited choice of films (old: 2016 release being the most recent), TV shows were also uninteresting. Service was exceptional on both flights, crew very helpful, friendly and professional. They could be even better if had more knowledge of food and beverages served, as well as skill in serving them.

✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Manila ,August 2017,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,no,1,"  My wife's ""non-stop"" flight on August 8, 2017 from San Francisco to Manila was late arriving in SFO by an hour and then diverted to Japan for an unscheduled stop and refueling, then arrived in Manila 3 hours late, causing my wife to miss her connecting flight. The plane personnel promised passengers they would arrange for new connecting flights when they arrived in Manila. But when she went to the Philippine Airlines ticket counter, the employees refused any kind of help. I spent 5 hours on the phone trying to resolve this with PAL and got nothing but frustration from their customer service department. Cebu Pacific was just as uncooperative and charged my wife full fare for another connecting flight, so she paid twice for one flight. Philippine Airlines has refused to compensate my wife for the connecting flight or give her a partial refund of her ""non-stop"" flight ticket. She could have made her connecting flight if the plane wasn't late to SFO to begin with. Bottom line, the employees lie through their teeth to appease you, and once you are at the final destination, they refuse any help. To add insult to injury, they also charged my wife an additional $150 because her carry on suitcase was over 15 pounds. The suitcase weighed half of that, and the candy she brought for kids made up more than the rest of the ""allowance"". $150 because she was slightly over 15 pounds. The flight she took from SLC to SFO did not charge her any extra. "

Flight was originally scheduled at 1110 am and was delayed by an hour. Notification was sent via email at 0930. Strangely nothing was said during check-in (0900), and we only knew it by chance because I opened my email using the airport's free wifi at 1000. There was no announcement or update on the tv screen. On-board, we were told that our pre-requested halal meals were unavailable. I have called the airlines' office in KL twice two weeks before departure from KUL to confirm. Airline crews did their best trying to appease us. Two fish-based meals, maybe extras from the business class, were given to us.  Will we fly with them again? Yes, but only if Philippine Airlines can get their act together. "

It was my first time I had travelled alone on a long haul flight, so naturally I was nervous about my journey. I researched my flight and read some distressing reviews about this flight! However, after being very sceptical about the flight I was pleasantly surprised and don't think the airline deserves the reviews it was getting! Yes, there was no inflight entertainment but they did give out iPads with charging packs. This meant we could watch films and TV series on there. The food was not always to my liking, but it was perfectly acceptable and there was plenty of it. The seats were okay, any long haul flight is going to have its discomforts and for the money spent on these flights it wasn't bad. The staff were all very accommodating and friendly. Don't get me wrong, it's not the best airline I have ever flown with but for the money I paid compared to other airlines I was pretty impressed. It got me to my destination on time and without too much discomfort. For a solo traveller on a budget i would recommend."

✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Darwin to London via Manila,July 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,no,1,"  Darwin to London via Manila. This was one of the worst airlines I have been on. The first leg of my journey was 4 hours (Darwin to Manila) and I was upgraded to business class (a very pleasant surprise). There were seats and inflight entertainment on this leg, though the food was still very average. I asked for a glass of wine at dinner and it never came, but otherwise a very acceptable journey. The second leg Manila to London was much much worse. It was a 14 hour journey, made even longer by the 2 hours we sat on the tarmac in Manila not moving. I received one meal during the flight, a dinner, which was almost entirely inedible. There was supposed to be another meal but I did not get it (not sure why, I saw that trolley go past but perhaps they had run out of food). I was seated in the last row of the plane, the light was on behind me the entire journey. When we got to Heathrow we taxied and parked and then we lost power to the plane.  There was no in-flight entertainment. There was an app that you could download before boarding the aircraft which was not advertised at all - the first I knew about it was when I got to the seat (and it was obviously too late to download). They handed out some ipads throughout the journey. Without the app or ipad, there was not a screen showing the progress of the plane or the time. I also flew back from Heathrow to Manila, then Manila to Darwin. On the Heathrow to Manila flight there was again no in-flight entertainment, but I had downloaded the app and it worked tolerably well (stuck in a few places due to the wifi speed). I was fed two meals on this flight but for both meals the meat portion was intolerable. They had also run out of the most popular choice of chicken (I was seated half way down in economy), so there was no choice of meal. The real kicker was the 4 hour delay in Manila between the hours of 11.30pm and 3.30am. They were an hour later than the re-scheduled flight. They provided us at around 1am with some deep fried chicken from Jolli Bees.  To top it off, it was not actually a cheap flight - the price was around a number of other airlines, but I went with them because the flight times were the best."

This was preceded by a 7 hour stopover in Manila after flight from Denpasar which was expected - however this turned into a 9.5hr stopover due to the delayed boarding time of the London flight. Neither planes had tvs and the cabin crew gave out ipads, half of which were out of battery already and they also didn't have enough for the plane. Luckily I had a couple film on my phone to watch.

There are a few movie selection, a few TV shows, audio, and electronic magazines, there is also a map where you can see the current position of the aircraft. There was an inflight magazine where you can see something interesting.  The food is very delicious and very presentable. My meal was assorted and healthy Japanese food. "

After taking both flights I would not hesitate to fly with the airline again on the same route. Ground service was good and check in was smooth. At YVR, PAL uses the plaza premium lounge and at JFK the Alitalia lounge. Both provided ample space, food, and amenities. As for the flights, each departed slightly behind schedule (30 minutes), however, the time was made up in the air and both arrived ahead of schedule. The captains kept the passengers well informed of delays and the flight status. The cabin crew were exceptional and attentive, addressing us by last name and checking on us. The meals served on both flights was very good (for both I chose the Filipino option). I would say the service and food is on par with CX, and much better than AC. On the flight to JFK, I got a newly configured Boeing 777 with lie flat seats, and on the return flight an old configuration 777 with angle flat seats (both in a 2-3-2 configuration). These seats were good for the 5 hour flight, however, they are not as good as the pods offered by CX and AC. PAL offered WIFI on the routes which was relatively fast for aircraft WIFI and worked with my device. Overall, my flights with PAL were of a good quality. Their soft product for the two flights was on par with CX and better than AC's on the route. Meanwhile, the hard product was not the best of the three, however, compared to United and Delta which operate the route in the summer season it is much better. Given the price point round trip which is considerably less than the competition, and that on a 5 hour flight hard product is not the most essential aspect, for me they are the best option for flying from YVR-JFK based on these two flights."

First time flying Philippine Airlines I didn't know what to expect though I've heard that the airline is currently going through a massive overhaul to become a 5-star airline by 2020. Check-in was fast and easy ground crew was very good. The boarding process was easy and the flight attendants were very welcoming and approachable. The seats were leather and decently comfortable though I found the seat a little too firm. Waited on the tarmac for 45 minutes just to take off though I don't blame airline rather on the aging and congested Manila airport. They served chicken buns and a simple drink service after takeoff. No WiFi or any other form of entertainment other than magazines which is fine given a 55-minute island hop. The cabin crew was very attentive, gave eye contact and smiled."

The baggage allowance was only 15kg per person. So we had to pay extra due to it being a bombardier aircraft they limit everybody to that weight.

Upon reaching the terminal pretty early in the morning, I was pleased to find no queues in the business class check in lane and got my seat and boarding pass quickly. Boarding was quick and friendly on both legs and both flights were on time. Flight crew do not address business passengers by name on such a short flight but they were friendly and courteous. Seats were old, but comfortable. Toilets were clean enough. Food was surprisingly good and adequate for a short 50 minute flight.

I am a regular traveller on this airline and no surprise that the flight was delayed by one hour with no explanation.

I am still seeking my claim against them for a delay in December 2016, which they made an offer for, but are yet to pay.  From my dealing with them they are very slow to reply to complaints if they do. I cannot recommend them and their customers deserve better, its time they started to listen to them.

Disgraceful service and would never use again. We missed our flight and tried to contact this company through their office in Bali which is where we were, and to make things worse the only office was in our hotel Kuta Paradiso which was never open. Eventually after hours of attempting to call we finally got a response. The price initially for the return business class flights was £3000 that we paid, we somehow missed the return flight and after contacting them at a cost of at least £100 extra as it's a premium number they use, they said we will charge you a cancellation fee and ask you to pay the difference for a return flight which they stated would be after deduction $7000. We then asked what it would be to fly economy and that was $6000.  We have now booked return business flights by Cathay Pacific and British Airways at a cost of €1347 each.

Flew from Manila to Bangkok. Flight crew rather efficient and treat passengers well. However, they need to make their meal service faster. The crew definitely is this airline's saving grace. In-flight services are quite bland. Their A330 has the on-line streaming of in-flight entertainment. During this flight it worked but in some other flights I took they did not work. Seats on their A330 are horribly narrow and tight that is so difficult to endure even on a 3 hour flight. Their airport hub in Manila is huge disappointment as well."

I have booked a roundtrip flight from YVR-MNL so flying from North America, I expected a slightly higher level of service. The flight to Manila was delayed for 2 hours without explanation, causing me to miss my connecting flight and set back my schedule for that day when I arrived. During the flight, it was close to impossible to sleep when seated at the aisle as the flight attendants slam through your arm as they pass by, without apology.

The upholsteries are too old and we saw some torn bits on the back of the seat. There are no seat mounted screens which I do expect as standard for long haul flights these days. There are no charging ports (usb or mains). I will never fly again with PAL on their London Manila (vice versa) flight unless they refurbish the interiors or use new aircraft.

Leaving RUH at 1900, arriving MNL at 1000 which means it is easy to catch local connection especially some domestic airports in the Philippines don't have the capability for night flights. The  flight was on time. However, since this is a high-density configuration seats are cramped and must be uncomfortable for taller people. Absence of AVOD is also a concern unless connected to MyPal player which is not advisable as it will drain your phone's battery. Return flight also the same. Other than these, I think I'll give PAL 8 points. I hope they'll soon launch their reconfigured A330 on this route."

My companion and I bought our economy class tickets at the last minute so we paid over USD 400 each. The A321 to Macau had a light load, which was in contrast to our high density A330 flight from Hong Kong, which was packed. Both flights had no IFE, which we were well aware of, but had hot meals, which are likely aimed at Filipinos who tend to expect generous servings of rice. The cabin crew were well groomed and gracious, which worked in a college-type of friendship way but not in a manner that will win them accolades. To be in PAL's A330, with its 3-3-3 economy class configuration feels like being in a crowded bus. There is no elbow room, shoulders and arms spill over to the aisles because the seats are for size 0 body types. The queue for immigration and the wait to get our bags were shambolic and frustrating, respectively. PAL is the sole airline tenant in MNL T2 so they should look after their passengers post-flight. The airline has declared that they are aiming to be 5 Star. I dare say, at the rate PAL is going, 5-Star airlines operating in Manila can rest easy, knowing PAL is everything a 5-Star airline is not."

I booked Business Class and expected priority check-in, priority baggage, priority boarding, lounge access etc. However there was no priority check-in available, there was no lounge to access, no priority boarding, my bags received no priority when coming out at the other end. All I got was a meal and an upgraded seat. There was no PAL desk at the departure area to make any enquiries, I had to spend 30 minutes on the phone at the terminal to discover that PAL had no lounge, even though they told me in the booking confirmation email to ""relax in their lounge"". What a joke! I even had to stand up in a bus going out from the terminal to the plane parked up far away from the terminal. All the benefits promised to my by PAL did not exist, and they did not care at all. There was no in-flight entertainment either. If you book business class you expect better standards and higher priority however PAL obviously don't care about their business class customers at all.  How can PAL sell me a business class ticket, take my money, promise me lounge access, and then not even have a lounge for me to access? After 30 minutes on the phone I was advised to ""relax in a cafe"" in the terminal. "

Whilst the airline provided their statutory obligations by providing overnight accommodation etc, as you can imagine the problems this caused with serious trouble and inconvenience for me and my fellow passengers. The UK agents for PAL are AVIAREPS PLC. Despite writing to them and following up with 2 emails, neither company has had the courtesy to respond to my request for out of pocket compensation. Apart from this and the fact that this route only provides entertainment from small iPads, try balancing these whilst sitting in very cramped seating arrangements. There is also no way to recharge your laptop for this 14.5 hour flight so trying to use their alternative inflight WiFi entertainment this service is only available for the life of your laptop batteries. Do not expect to get the standard of service offered by the likes of Etihad and Emirates who I will be returning to forthwith for future flights. I used to fly between 12 to 16 sectors a year with PAL but not again Not a recommended airline if you like those little extras like good customer service, responses to complaints or even an occasional drink during the flight. My Australian colleagues tell me that routes to Australia are better, so why not the UK route?

Booked with Philippine Airlines as they flew direct and I didn't want to waste time with a stop anywhere.  I got an email the day I was due to fly saying my flight was cancelled, no next steps or anything. Tried to phone the UK contact centre that I booked my flight through (PAL direct not an agent, stupidly I thought that was safer), they aren't open weekends! This was a Saturday and I was due to leave for the airport in a matter of hours when I got the cancellation email (mere hours after the flight reminder email). I paid a fortune to sit on hold on the phone to their Manila office, only to be told it was cancelled repeatedly with no suggestions other than for me to go to the airport and see if there was a Philippine Airline customer service team there (they couldn't confirm whether there was or not) and see if there was anything they could do to get me on another flight. Given this didn't sound promising I phoned back to speak to someone else. Eventually managed to get to speak to someone else, and booked on the next flight which wasn't for over another 24 hours. At no point did anyone acknowledge the cost to me of this cancellation (I had hotels, transfers and tours booked to follow on from the flight) or the fact that I lost over 24 hours in the Philippines and didn't get to do the tours I'd booked at all in the end because of this cancelation. Communication was really poor the whole way through and when I asked any questions I just got 'it's cancelled ma'am' or 'hello?' as the answer, it was hard work arranging a new flight. The reason for cancellation was something about 'airport scheduling' which seems poor when it's cancelled on the day. The flight I then got over 24 hours later left London late and arrived in Manila late. My return flight also departed Manila late and arrived in London significantly late - people were complaining they had missed transfers when we landed. Just a hugely stressful, disappointing and frustrating experience. I'll take a longer journey with a stop next time just to use a more reliable airline. As long as I get there safely and preferably on time I don't really fuss over the in flight experience but for those that do, it's the most basic long flight I've ever been on. No back of seat screens (on a 16 hr flight) for in flight video, yes they do give out iPad minis with a few films on, but this happens quite some time after take off and the battery obviously doesn't last the flight! Bring your own and a good power pack. I'd avoid using this airline again and wish I hadn't at all. I actually missed the highlight of my holiday because of my airline choice unfortunately, it's not worth the risk if you have plans at your destination."

Most of the staff both on the ground and in the cabin did not have the attitude of great hospitality which Filipinos are supposed to be known for.

The flight was supposed to depart at 8:45pm and they waited until midnight to tell is it was cancelled. It took another hour or so to get back to the check in counter where I was told that the next flight would be from Caticlan (2 hour drive) at 7:45am. The airline said they would provide me with a hotel for the night and transportation to Caticlan in the morning. They also told me that they will take care of the airport fee (200 pesos that where paid at Kalibo) and that I wouldn't have to pay again. After 2 hours sleep I got into a minibus for a 2 hour drive to Caticlan. When I got there I was told that the 7:45am flight was delayed to 9:40am. I was not offered to move to a different carrier and I was also told that I had to pay again the airport fee because ""the people at Kalibo airport say they gave me my money back"". When I protested and said it wasn't true the check in person kept on saying that the Kalibo people say they gave my money back. So not only was I exhausted from all this mess, I had to pay an additional 200 pesos. Some service. Appalling."

The level of service is significantly poor especially when the flight gets crowded. The cabin staff are not sufficient to serve a large number of passenger. The service is acceptable to me only when it is around 60% of occupancy. The meal service is too slow; the food carts are not evenly spread in each section to serve, so some get it early enough but others are left without being served too long; drinks that are available in the less crowded flights are out of stock in the crowded flights. The meal tray is roughly put in the table; forget the drink order and no any word for apology, etc. It is not one time thing that I experience things above, but it happens whenever I take the flight that are crowded. I have taken PAL flight more than 10 times in past, but it never satisfies me even in certain level. One thing that I noticed it was improved is that now the small dessert spoon is available for sure (before that, I had to eat it by chopstick). The airline celebrates 76th anniversary this year, according to their magazine ""Mabuhay"". Unfortunately, the level of service is too poor unlike their proud history of being the oldest airline company of all in Asia."

Flew Philippine Airlines from Manila to San Francisco, CA. The seats were small and cramped. The aisles were very narrow. They had placed 3 seats on next to window and 4 seats in the middle. There was a disorganized delay of loading the plane due to the number of elderly people requiring wheelchairs. In addition the ground crew insisted on loading passengers from just one side of their podium (even though they had enough employees to allow loading from both sides). Once on board there was a lack of overhead bins to accomodate everyone's carry on luggage. The food was awful. The breakfast that was served appeared to have powdered eggs and were very watery. The Longanisa was not cooked. Both dinner and breakfast were so awful that I only ate the bread and jam and also the dried Mangos from Cebu. The bathrooms always seemed to have a line of waiting passengers. The bathroom closest to our seats had a sink that would not drain. There was no razors, combs, or toothbrush and toothpaste as we had received on previous flights. The take-off was delayed as they had to offload 2 passengers who apparently felt ill after having boarded the plane and needed to be deplaned. The entertainment system had a very limited selection. In fact many of the same movies from the flight over (4 weeks prior) had the same selections. The music that was available was very limited (it seemed that they were encouraging you to use your own cellphone and headphones for the music portion. Upon arrival, the customs procedure went very smoothly but we were very disappointed when it took more than 1 hour to collect our luggage from the carousel.

Back then the Philippines was known as the smile of Asia, so your holiday should start when you get on the plane not when you get off. This was my first time to fly this airline in twenty years. The nightmare began at the check-in at Sydney, the max luggage for economy was 30kg and 7kg carry on, it was obvious that 95% of the passengers were Filipinos or expat Filipinos and part of their culture is to bring back as much as goods as they can to their loved ones back in their homeland. I was shocked to see amount of excess luggage that was being loaded both at the check in and online check in queues. So much that they needed a large cage that resembled something from a zoo, I would estimate somewhere between twenty to thirty kilos for at least half of the passengers, not to mention the excess carry on baggage. Twenty years ago the airline would serve you a snack and 2 hot meals an abundance of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, two movies, toothpaste & brush and padded eye shield for sleep on an eight hour flight. Today all you will get is a very small almost inedible hot meal, very little to drink, a cheese and ham toasted sandwich for a snack, no inflight entertainment. They do have free WiFi but that takes away the experience you should look forward to when travelling. So if you don't have your own tablet or smartphone, tough. The aircraft advertised was an A340 but I later found out it may have been a A330, standard 70 rows, somehow they managed to get 78 rows, Virtually no leg room, seats were small and cramped, the aisle way was very narrow, toilets very small, could not contact stewardesses as seat controls didn't seem to work. This aircraft should only be used for short flights only one to three hours max and not for an eight hour flight. When I disembarked I felt tired, exhausted, dehydrated with muscular soreness. I will never fly this airline internationally again. An embarrassment for a national carrier."

Food choices are limited and often many passengers have no choice other than the Japanese set because PAL never seems to have sufficient Western sets on-board to meet demand. There is no seatback IFE, although the flight-attendants offer an iPad that connects to PAL's WiFi IFE. The problem with trying to hold an iPad for a 120 minute movie are obvious, especially during the meal service. The seats provide the opposite (literally, as they are arranged 2-2-2 in a reverse herringbone configuration) of the privacy expected in modern Business Class, with the adjacent passenger having a wonderful across your laptop screen. Worse, PAL has developed a habit, maybe because Filipinos are not accustomed to true airline quality and thus don't complain, of selling tickets and then changing the schedule or aircraft type weeks before the flight. Accordingly, I was just informed that my Business Class return to Tokyo on March 15 is now downgraded to Economy because PAL decided to replace the 2-class A330 with a single-class version! Worse, PAL has no intention of making any reparation to me because Philippines law apparently doesn't require them to! "

The travel experience on Philippines Airlines is generally pleasant. Check-in at airport was fast and efficient. However, airport facilities need to be upgraded as the terminal seemed to be in it's full capacity leaving very little sitting room for transit time and few eating and shopping choices at the departure area. Flight is generally good. Staff seems to be better trained and more efficient now without sacrificing their warmth in service. Biggest improvement is the food they served; taste and portioning has vastly improved compared to the last time I took a short-haul PR economy flight last year. Seat comfort is average mainly due to quite a tight legroom compared to other airlines. I had no issues with the seat itself considering it being just a short flight. Flight was on-time in both cases and baggage claim was prompt and efficient. The extra 30-50USD you pay compared to local budget airline competitors and the 30-50USD you save compared to other regional Asian carriers is worth it. Philippine Airlines is a good choice for short to medium haul flights and I would not hesitate booking with this airline again."

The A320 is not suitable for longhaul flights. I asked politely for an aisle seat, and then I got a window seat which meant disturbing the two people next to me each time I had to use the toilet. The economy cabin is cramped and no individual entertainment screen. Indigestible breakfast offered on the Cairns to Manila leg. Only 3 cabin staff working in economy on what was a very full plane. Short-staffing meant that the drink with the meal came 20 minutes after the meal. I am not criticising the cabin crew; they tried, but there were just the three of them.

The most cringe-worthy flight I ever had. For the seating arrangement, I was partly to blame. During check-in, opened seats were few that 49 or 51H was one of the remaining aisle seats. At the airport, there were many seats opened. The check-in attendant arranged to move me further which I couldn't care less either so I agreed to his offer of 68H aisle seat. The problem was despite of bigger aircraft, legroom was worse than A321 I had from Manila to Nagoya and that 68H's recline is not working! It felt as if seating in LCC and and this was what I got for the money I pay for. Now I also understand why the many low scores here regarding inflight entertainment. I experienced myPAL player myself. The aircraft will only let me use myPAL player few minutes before logging in or punching in my email. When I entered my email it never worked! I was given 15MB of free data but then I paused it only to find out after 30 minutes it already gone while being unused! When the food was served, Japanese passengers were only offered bento box while Filipinos or any other nationalities were fitted to chicken and pork steaks. I am not sure why but it was a culture-shock for me. I knew that PR is culture-sensitive but bento wasn't even offered to Filipinos like me. When it comes to the staff, they have always been helpful. The classic smooth runway landing has always been in PAL's spirit so no problem with that. The problem with this airline is the sad state of Manila airport. I would recommend flying with them if you care about generous baggage allowance. Else, fly with better airline if you have money and connection time to spare."

I took a connecting flight to Boracay Island by Cebu Pacific. I thought I got a fairly good deal Business Class ticket for US$1250. Unfortunately, on the day of my return flight, there was a typhoon in Boracay Island. All flight services from Caticlan airport were cancelled for 2 days. There was no boat service to reach Caticlan from Boracay for 24 hours. So I had no option but to miss the night PAL flight to Sydney and try to reschedule it. The misery started when I tried to contact PAL customer service to reschedule my flight. It took me around 8 phone calls and 7 hours of effort to get my flight rescheduled. I kept on trying to convince them that it was not my fault, that I was missing the flight due to the typhoon, but they refused to accept this. I was dumbfounded when the lady on the other line stated the total cost of rebooking is approximately US$5620 as I got a promo offer previously.  They kept on hold for over 45 minutes and the line got disconnected. I tried to call then again at least 6-8 times and each time they kept me on hold for at least 45 minutes, repeatedly getting disconnected. They never even attempted to call me back for the first 6 hours. After 7 hours of struggling, I finally settled rescheduling the ticket for a penalty of US$819. The only redeeming feature of this airline is that the service in Business class was above average with reasonable food. This review is a warning other travellers – even if you get good prices on ticket offers it is not worth using PAL due to its appalling customer service."

I am a Mabuhay Miles Premier Elite member and would like to forewarn other Mabuhay Miles members that it is not worth the effort to qualify for the Premier Elite level as the benefits over those of Elite level are valueless unless you travel with a companion who is not an Elite member. There is no difference in the Elite and Premier Elite bonus miles (both earn a flat 25% bonus on top of the service class miles), and airport treatment (free baggage allowance, priority check-in and boarding) are identical. There is one difference in that Premier Elites can take a guest into the Mabuhay Lounge whereas Elites can only enter the Lounges alone. The main perceived benefit of achieving Premier Elite is possibly the two free service class upgrade certificates, but in practice upgrading using the certificates is very difficult (you must buy an overpriced Economy Q-class fare that is only 15% less expensive than a guaranteed Business class fare and mot available through Philippine airlines' website) and upgrade availability is very limited. In reality its much less effort, and only marginally more expensive, to buy a Business class ticket in the first place. Philippine Airlines repeatedly states its intention to become a 5-Star airline but I think that given their current policies and attitudes its an unobtainable goal."

For this reason I accepted that their Business Class does not deliver what other airlines offer. Flight Attendants were wonderfully friendly and polite, and immaculately dressed, and addressed me by name, but for some reason the pre-takeoff drink does not include alcohol, unlike other carriers. Meals were mostly very good, but are not served with salt or pepper, which must be requested from the flight crew, and even then you are given sachets, not china salt and pepper shakers as with other airlines. Meal service was somewhat hit and miss, and rather disorganised. The breakfast menu included yoghurt and cereal, which we were never offered. Breakfast on one flight did not include tea or coffee, and on the flights when I requested tea with breakfast, my cup was filled with hot, (not boiling) water, and I had to wait for a teabag, which usually arrived when the water was lukewarm. Milk was never offered with tea or coffee, unless you asked for it, so I just gave up and drank my lukewarm tea black, which is not really acceptable for Business Class. The IFE was not real reliable, and movie and music channels were intermittent and jerky. At one stage my IFE refused to function, and I was offered an I-Pad instead. Alcohol service was willingly offered and call bells were answered promptly. The A340 was a much better plane, with heaps of leg room and lie flat seats, but the A320 was uncomfortable.

On the email, they ask you to call a Philippine Number. This is very stupid, as they fly to numerous international destinations, and I believe that it is necessary for them to have an international hotline so their customers do not rack up on uneccessary roaming fees on the 1 hour long phone call needed to know about the cancelled flight and to rebook refund your ticket!

I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised with the level of service that we received with Philippine Airlines, everything from start to finish went smoothly for us from the departure times to the inflight service, we didn't have a single issue. All of the cabin staff that we encountered were lovely, very helpful and extremely courteous, everything was done with a smile and the utmost professionalism. The plane was somewhat dated but clean and functional. The inflight entertainment system was not up to scratch but we didn't mind as I like to read and my daughter watches her own shows on her laptop. The meals were fine, not fabulous but certainly edible and no better or no worse than other airlines that I have flown with. I have a friend who flew to the UK at the same time as us but she flew a different airline out of Brisbane and she paid almost the same just for her ticket as I did for both mine and my daughter's tickets. A lot of people are sceptical when flying an airline that they are not familiar with and I was no different. I wouldn't hesitate to use Philippine Airlines again, I have no desire to spend a vast amount more for my fare just to fly a preferred airline, I'd rather the extra money to spend while on holidays!"

Ended up spending 5 hours at the JFK airport and departing at 5am - with no notice or explanations whatsoever. On the way back from Vancouver to JFK, our flight ended up getting delayed for more than 2 hours - again with no notice or explanations. PAL knew the flight would be delayed but did not inform customers until they were at the airport.  We did not find out that our flight was going to be delayed until we arrived at the airport. There was no email or notification. We were using the same plane as a flight from Vancouver to JFK. This Vancouver flight was delayed for 3 hours, with that in mind, there was no way that our flight could take off in time if the previous flight was delayed. The worst part was that PAL knew about this delay 10 hours ahead of time and did not notify customers. They also did not update flight status. When we got to the airport, all the PAL employees seemed to know about the delay because there was no one working at the counters.  PAL told us that the flight would be delayed for 2 hrs so instead of a midnight departure, we would be having a 2am departure. By the time 2am rolled by, we still did not see the plane and there was no explanation from PAL as to when we were supposed to depart and why we were being delayed. From 2am - 5am, we were requested to switch gates and were told 2x that they were experiencing delays.  On the way back from Vancouver, we were told the plane was being delayed for 1 hour; however, we ended being delayed for more than 2 hours -- with no explanation. Philippine Airlines seems to not care about it's passengers at all. After some research, we saw that this JFK to Vancouver flight had been on time for about 40% of the time for the past few months or so. With that statistic, redo your schedule or tell your customers about it.  PAL would rather post unrealistic departure times than to change their schedules. "

Due to a lack of available seat on other airlines I was forced to take PAL instead. As the usual the flight was delayed, although it was only delayed less than an hour. My main concern is the inflight entertainment, I rated it as very poor for the following reason, first there is no individual entertainment in seat and if you want to watch a film or listen a music, you have to download the app on your phone. We all know that watching thru an iphone will consume the battery in less than an hour and there is no electrical outlet provided near the seat. 2 hours entertainment for an almost 10 hour flight. Secondly, the seat distances are too narrow. No room to sleep and when the person seated next to you needs to go to WC, you have to get out of your seat so that they can move out. "

Flew from Manila to Hong Kong. To get the bad out of the way, the penny-pinching of the company can be seen in the half baked lie flat seats. There is the absence of IFE, which they try to compensate for by giving pre-loaded iPads. The entertainment selection is good, but the lack of a space to place it means you watch on your tray table, which is impossible at mealtime. There is also the absence of the side console to place the welcome drinks. The 2-2-2 configuration is such that if you prefer a window seat, you have no direct aisle access and the modified herringbone means that at the lie flat position, spaces between adjacent seats overlap. PAL dropped the ball here. Check in was passable and the lounge is a good way to escape the chaos that is the transit area of T2. Wifi is onboard to stream their entertainment, but was spotty the few times I used the service to browse/email. Now the good - the Philippines is strong in the service sector and this can be seen in the warm, friendly and sincere service of the flight crew. They can be chatty without being intrusive and seem to have a good gauge on when you need to be left alone. The highlight of the flight is the food. CX only serves pathetic pastries on their MNL-HKG-MNL hops. PR serves full meal service and on J class, it is the saving grace along with the flight crew.

However, it did not contain anything like the range of films shown on the Philippine Airlines website : there were no movies less than a year old, and there were only about 20-30 movies in total. iPads with more films were available on request on the MNL-LHR vv legs, but not on the Sydney legs, and they'd run out of iPads on the MNL-LHR leg. Transfers at Manila quick and easy. NAIA Terminal 2 isn't pretty, but security screening and processing were fast and efficient. Check-in at all three airports was fast and efficient. The A330 (SYD-MNL) was pretty new. Seating was 3-3-3. The A340s were all ex-Iberia, and were very old. Seating was 2-4-2, and was generous. On the A340s the drop down TV screens were all broken, one way or another. On the MNL-SYD, the screen towards the front of economy had completely lost vertical hold, so there was a spinning black-and-white-ish screen flashing for most of the flight. On all A340 flights, the music played on landing appeared to be from a tape player. While I am sure that some people enjoy piano covers of Nu-Metal hits from the early 2000s (a low-budget Richard Clayderman clone playing Linkin Park), the music was played on an old, stretched, twisted tape, and sounded so bad that people were openly laughing at it. Playing music on a broken cassette player and showing films on a broken TV don't inspire confidence in the plane. "

I have mixed feelings about this flight based on the fact that it seems that Philippine Airlines is trying to become a discount airline at the same time that they want to appear to be a full service airline. Online booking is confusing at times because you cannot choose your special meal in anyway so forget it if you are a vegetarian (even when I telephoned the airline requesting this in Bangkok they told me I could not do it so had to bring my own sandwich on the flight). You cannot pay the extra fee online to get a premium economy seat or one of the forward seats but you can pay for them on the flight and upgrade which is very strange. It would make so much more sense to do this online. Check-in in Bangkok was done by contact employees with PAL staff observing. I was told that I did not need to pick up my bags in Manila but having done this route before I knew I needed to clear customs with the bags so it is a good thing I remembered. That needs to be corrected or some people will not get there luggage. The flight was delayed 45 minutes which was unfortunate and every time I have flown this flight it is delayed. The crew on the flight are very polite and highly trained. They do everything they can to try and make passengers comfortable including getting everyone to close the window screens after takeoff to cut down on the glare. This would make sense if they had in-seat TV but they do not. On any over 3 hour flight it is almost criminal to not have in-seat TV. I did talk to a staff on the flight who said she was from management and promised to check into some things and email me back for after 11 days I have not received anything. The wifi is as slow as it is in the Philippines and the My PAL player app barely works so forget downloading it. waste of time. Wifi in Terminal 2 is terrible - the PAL wifi is non-existent. you can connect but you are connected to nothing. Amazing that in 2016 they cannot provide decent wifi that works. The flight to Cebu City was delayed by 1.15 hrs. The flight was fine but they refused to give me a blanket and said it was policy not to give blankets in economy but the plane was freezing. Another example of them becoming a discount airline. I sent a comment to Philippine Airlines about the no blanket policy and after 10 days have not received a reply.

It was almost a budget airline flight with less leg room and no in-flight entertainment. The food was limited and after an unpleasant terminal experience in Manila I was not at all impressed.

Flying such a very small plane on such a relatively long flight meant that there was always a queue for the limited number of toilets. Also it means there is no seat back entertainment, you are forced to view a 10 inch screen that drops from the ceiling 3 seats ahead. Seats were roomy enough and there was adequate leg room even for a larger person like myself. The inflight catering was meager with miniscule portions of barely edible food. The cabin service was appalling. Meals were served in a haphazard fashion, and for some reason we were not offered tea or coffee. I waited until they had finished meal service before ringing the attendant bell and it still took 20 minutes before anyone came. The male crew members were friendly enough however the females had a constant scowl. This is not a budget airline, and the prices they charge should enable them to provide world class service, which they dont!

Comfort: Very narrow and uncomfortable seats which is more suitable for domestic 2-3 hour flights and not for a longhaul London to Manila straight flight. Old domestic flight plane and seat backing was peeling off, leg room terrible. Staff: Flight staff young and unprofessional on inbound journey, did not even offer the supposed Ipads on board for entertainment to anyone on the flight. Staff on flight back to the UK were better experienced, courteous and professional, gave out the iPads on board during the flight and collected before embarking. Food: Terrible and barely any choice at all. I was served a burnt beef dish and they had run out of replacements. The food was not up to international standards, packaged poorly with loose foil covers that looked like it had been opened to check inside, no way near the quality of food served on other international airlines with the same price. Entertainment: The plane is old with very primitive TV screen that comes down from the ceiling with no choice at all, you're stuck with whatever is shown. No way near the entertainment provided in other airlines around the same price, with separate screens each passenger and wide choice of movies, shows, music and games. As a Filipino family (5) based in the UK, we had used 7 other airlines before and we were excited to fly our flag carrier for the first time and promote it to others but we were disappointed. The only benefit was the straight flight with no transfers but for us it was not worth sitting uncomfortably for around 13 hrs with barely any entertainment and poor food choices. It might suit solo travellers who just want to get to their destination quickly. As my son would put it, the only good thing was that we got to our destination. We sincerely hope that things improve to promote tourism in our country but we will probably use another airline next time."

We were running late to our flight and received a call from a PA employee who told us not to rush and that they'd put us on a flight for the next day. When asked if our flight from Sydney would be the same with the connecting flight (from Manila to London) also taken care of we were told 'Yes, relax, and enjoy Sydney for one more day... You're details will be on the system. Just get to check-in for 9 and you'll be good to go.' When I asked for more details about the connecting flight and a confirmation email I was told it really wasn't necessary as everything would be ok. Brilliant, what a great company I thought... We arrived at the airport at 9, went to check-in and nobody knew who we were. We weren't on the system. After a very worrying 5 minutes or so, the lady at the counter told us she could get us on the flight, but once we were in Manila there wouldn't be a connecting flight for another two nights. Brilliant. The lady who had called had essentially told us the opposite. Not knowing a thing about Manila, and not being prepared with this knowledge beforehand, we really weren't in any position to stay there two nights. This was a lot to spring on us. When we told the lady at the counter that this wasn't feasible and that we weren't told this before, we were given little customer service. Just a shrug and a look which said I don't care. I understand we missed our flight, and of course that was very much our fault and nobody else's, but to give us false information was what really caused us more trouble than necessary. Because they decided to lie to us (or withhold information) we were forced to book a different, extortionate flight from the airport's flight centre. Had we known the flight was going to be that way, we could have prepared ourselves for a couple of nights in Manila or taken our time to find a cheaper alternate flight. We maybe could have even saved on the extra accommodation we ended up booking in Sydney. Of course we've had even more of a rigmarole trying to tell this to Philippine Airlines. They don't return emails, when you ring they tell us to go through our 3rd party booker, Skiddoo, who are just as bad and tell us they won't complain on our behalf as the ticket in non-refundable. For me, that's besides the point. We were misinformed and nobody is willing to take responsibility for that. So, if you don't mind an airline with lazy customer service, who don't appreciate paying customers and aren't willing to help them out in their times of need, book with Philippine Airlines because they don't care about anything except your money."

For about 45 mins before being taken to the plane, we sat their shivering being exposed to the cold January air because the ramp door was kept open. Only after repeated complaints did the ground steward/stewardess who were busy chatting to each other and playing with their cell phones, notice and attended to fix the problem. The behavior of these young ground crew, to me, was unattentive and unprofessional. Despite the touted reputation of Philippine cuisine, the inflight food was among the worst that I could imagine. One selection was fish ceviche, and it was the only ceviche dish cooked without any hint of sourness or vinegar. A small bread roll came in with the serving. And it came without any butter.

We had to show our boarding cards as an anti-theft measure, so the whole process was wearisome. The games didn't work on the device I was given. That one could use one's own device was small comfort. Not everyone has such an item and besides, there were no charging sockets in economy on our flight. We were 'put to bed' with indecent haste after lunch.

For a business class seat, the seats are cramped, and I can't really call those seats comfy. Softer cushions would have made a world of difference. Also, the decision to give passengers iPad minis in lieu of seat back TV screens is a step backward in my opinion. I would prefer to have my hands free while relaxing on a flight.  The inflight entertainment selections were also limited. I didn't think I got my money's worth on these seats, other airlines offer better seats at comparable prices.

In HKG, Philippine Airlines told us we could only have two bags so we needed to pay $140 for the extra bag or retrieve it from baggage claim and recheck the other two. We had a five hour layover so chose to get back our bags. After 90 minutes of waiting we were told one of our bags couldn't be found so we needed to wait some more. After two hours we were told the small bag would only cost $20 so we paid but then the price was increased to $50. Finally after three hours and one of our bags still missing we we're left with the choice of paying $50, abandoning the 5kg bag or missing our flight. We paid but will never fly Philippine Airlines again. Hence, for a few dollars they lost a family of five that frequently fly international."
,A321,Business,Economy Class,SIN to MNL,November 2015,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,3.0,2.0,no,4,"Singapore to Manila with Philippine Airlines. A320 cabin is pleasant but the lack of legroom and aisle space is very evident. As expected, there is no inflight entertainment. PAL crew demonstrate inflight safety procedures manually. Meals was a choice of pepper chicken or pork adobo; smaller tray, smaller portions - main meal, small serving of salad, roll and cake. Asked for butter and attendant sarcastically replied that ""it's only available upon request"". I couldn't believe my ears so I asked again and she replied again with a smirk, after getting the butter and handing it to me. Since when do you serve dinner rolls without butter?  I asked the senior cabin crew if it was the standard for them to serve dinner rolls without butter and she showed me her inventory form. Only 10 pcs of butter was loaded for a full flight of almost 200 passengers. She also asked the male purser to explain the situation."
,A330-300,Business,Economy Class,Manila to Bangkok,October 2015,2.0,4.0,3.0,,,4.0,3.0,yes,5,"I'm a frequent traveller of Philippine Airlines and recently flew MNL-BKK return on an A330-300. Check-in on both flights smooth and courteous. A330-300 on both flights, but the 3-3-3 configuration is a give away that PAL has given in to the stiff competition offered by Cebu Pacific by going low-cost. PAL urgently needs to decide what they are - full service or low cost!  The lack of inflight entertainment would be felt on medium to long haul flights. Though they offer free ""In-Air"" entertainment, you have to download their app before the flight to use it and the lack of prior information makes it impossible to access it if, like me, you did not download the app beforehand. The food consisted of a choice of pork or chicken. I was able to get the chicken dish on the outbound flight. The food was tasty but a small portion, with a token salad. The bread served on the return flight was rock hard and no butter. The ice cream dessert was welcome. Friendly service in spite of the poor quality and food presentation, was quite noticeable. Baggage handling improved and were on the carousel as we came out of Immigration.  I hope PAL puts its act together and decides pronto what their positioning is in the growing Asian air transportation market, otherwise, it would lose any competitive advantage it has over other neighboring airlines."
,,Business,Economy Class,Bangkok to Cebu City via Manila,October 2015,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,2.0,no,5,"Philippine Airlines is improving but they have a long way to go to match some of their Asian competitors. The online booking process is good but you cannot pick a special meal online. This can only be done by special request on the telphone or in person at their office. Since Philippine Airlines never answers the telephone in Thailand and rarely answers it in the Philippines it is not something simple to do. The flight check in is done by airport staff not Philippine Airline staff but this was smooth and trouble free. Boarding was easy and they begin boarding about 40 minutes before departure so if you do not like sitting on a plane that is not moving stay in the lounge until the final call. Service on the flight was very good, staff were excellent and very attentive. I had to ask for a blanket 4 times from 3 different attendants and finally got one but they eventually ran out so other passengers were not able to have one and the plane was very cold. Food was about a 3 out of 10 but they did give ice cream at the end of the meal which was a nice touch. Seats are not very comfortable and the legroom is terrible for a person 5'10"" or larger. My knees were up quite high and then the passenger in front reclined his seat and I had to spread my legs just to fit in the seat. There was no in seat tv's which was very disappointing for a 3+ hour flight. I have taken this flight on Thai Airways and they have in seat tv. Arrival in Manila is confusing and terminal 2 is very old and should be replaced. If you are transferring to another flight you pass through immigration then wait for 30 minutes to get your bag, have customs sign your customs form and give it to the transfer desk. No one is there to explain this so you have to figure this out yourself. After passing your bag to the transfer staff you proceed to try and find the domestic terminal which is upstairs and then get to the gate for the flight to Cebu. The internet in the terminal is almost non-existent and very frustrating. There is only 1 washroom in the entire terminal. Seats are metal and very uncomfortable. The domestic flight to Cebu was fine, but the space between seats is very small. If the passenger in front of you reclines their seat its like they are in your lap. Service was good but they did not have pillows or blankets for economy passengers."
,A330-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Dubai,December 2014,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,yes,8,"It was my first time to use Philippine Airlines for an international flight. It was better compared to the budget airline Cebu Pacific. Regarding the meals, you have to choose either Beef and Chicken, but the dessert they need to improve more because it's like a left-over. The FA's provide good to excellent customer and hospitality service. They assist well the passengers all throughout the flight. All in all it was good service for a budget airline."
,,Business,Economy Class,Manila to Ho Chi Minh City,March 2015,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,4.0,3.0,no,6,"I am not a big fan of Philippine Airlines. Their tickets are overpriced for the average service you get and the aircraft are usually older. The onboard entertainment system is mediocre. Cabin crew is okay, but that does not improve the experience."
,A340-300 / A330-300,Family Leisure,Business Class,LHR to SYD via MNL,July 2015,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes,9,"London Heathrow to Sydney via Manila return with Philippine Airlines. I was pleasantly surprised with them, and upgraded to Business class at LHR for $700 (approx £520 with taxes) and was worth the money. Cabin crew were attentive and friendly. Seat was okay with decent legroom and food was quite decent. MNL-SYD was on an A330, so make sure you have a device with the PAL inAir App downloaded, as they offer no in seat IFE. Seats were quite narrow but there was no one sat next to me on both sectors, so I stretched out. Again, cabin crew were attentive and friendly and food was decent. On the return trip to London I was sat in Economy. The seat was slightly uncomfortable around the head area but was okay once the seat was reclined. Cabin crew and food the same. You get what you pay for with this airline - they get you from A to B, and in my case the most direct and convenient. Do not expect the standards of Singapore Airlines or Emirates. The cabin interior is old and in need of a refit and there is no individual IFE, but that is reflected in the price. 4 flights left on time and arrived early or on schedule. My only complaint is that the food portions were far too small."
,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MNL to KLO via LGP,September 2015,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,3.0,4.0,yes,7,"I took 3 domestic flights with Philippine Airlines recently (MNL-LGP, LGP-MNL-KLO) and although all were on A320 aircraft, standards varied considerably. The first aircraft was a bit of a disgrace, the seats around me had coffee stains and caked-on food (I guess it was food), and to cap it off the seat pitch was only 28 inches (the fare conditions promised 29). The second aircraft was much tidier, in a 2 class configuration, although the flight was delayed for more than 1 hour and I would have appreciated knowing this before entering the waiting area at Legazpi airport. Final flight was more like Cebu Pacific, all-economy layout with leather seats. All flights offered a small snack, and even the cheap tickets had a small checked baggage allowance, making for excellent value."
,A330-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Manila to Hong Kong,May 2015,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes,7,"Philippine Airlines uses terminal 3 which is less crowded. The business class check in service and courtesy is great. Mabuhay lounge is not very big but good food choices, also shower facilities. New pod type flat bed seats on this flight, however, there is no personal TV - they provide business class passengers an iPod. Alternatively, you may access all that via wifi on board. The service of PAL is as good as other Asian airlines. Good food, although small in quantity. For short to medium haul flights, Philippine Airlines can be a good choice."
,A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Manila to Jakarta,August 2015,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,yes,7,"Manila-Jakarta business class. Overall this was an enjoyable flight. The aircraft is not new with old style recliner seat, adequate for 4-hour flight but since this was a red-eye flight, it's not comfy to sleep on this type of seat. The dinner was abundant even though no menu is offered to passenger. The cabin crew did their job well. After meal service, the cabin crew spent the time chatting or sleeping at the back of business cabin. Each seat is equipped with PTV, but I only turned on the flight map. For the price they charged and the facility they offered, I would say it's not good value for money. "

There was no IFE on the A320-200. Then I arrived at Davao. 1 week later I flew to Cebu. Once all passengers were onboard we were told there way a delay, I had to wait around 1 hour and 25 mins before we took off."

,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Bangkok,July 2015,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,4.0,yes,7,"Flew Economy for MNL-BKK and back for a short trip to Bangkok. Cabin crew were very attentive. On my flight to Bangkok, a woman was complaining about the only two meal choices available for Economy (pork and beef), but the staff were able to produce chicken and vegetarian meals for her. The seat pitch was a bit narrow, but once you recline your seat it doesn't seem so bad. On the return flight, we rode on a B777 and I was glad for the individual IFE. My seatmate's though kept restarting every fifteen minutes or so, and she had to select another movie that would play until the end. Food was okay, I liked the ones in our first flight better."
,,Business,Economy Class,Manila to Bangkok,June 2015,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no,3,"Booking online and getting the baggage allowance is impossible so when you arrive to check in I was charged 1600 pesos for 1 kg over the weight! Long long lines to check in to the flight, very old and decaying terminal with no wifi - this is PAL's own terminal - one would think they would at least have the best most modern terminal for their national airline! The plane was old - with no in seat entertainment or TV screens on the walls. The food was awful. Toilets were not clean on the plane. The only redeeming feature was the staff were very nice and friendly and tried to be helpful. The last complaint is some of the regional flights arrive at Terminal 3 so you have to take a 1 hour taxi ride to get to Terminal 2 to catch the international flight."
,,Business,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,yes,10,"On a recent trip to Australia from the U.S., I decided to try Philippine Airlines. I flew Business class and was very pleased with every aspect of the trip. I found the aircraft to be in good comfortable condition. The staff to be very friendly and attentive. The food was very acceptable by airline standards. The only caveat would be that you have to allow an extra day to your trip as a night at a hotel in Manila would be required to allow for scheduled flights. Given that time is not an issue with me, I found Philippine Airlines a good choice."
,,Business,Business Class,Vancouver to Manila,,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,,3.0,no,3,"I flew with PAL Business class, Boeing 777 PR 0117 and 0118 for April 17 2015. The service was just like any economy airline and the food lacks quality. They served salted fish and the rest are of fast food type Western Food. The crew were all smiles but unable to problem-solve. This is my second time to fly PAL and I always fly business class with other airlines. I cannot recommend this airline for business class. Perhaps economy would be more suitable. All it offered was a direct flight from Vancouver to Phil and back. However, there might be more fun flying with airlines that stop over Japan or Hong Kong provided you have enough lay over time."
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,2.0,no,5,Flew MNL-BKK-MNL using an Airbus 330-300. Flights were both on-time. Inflight crew were attentive and friendly which I guess is the airline's advantage. Inflight service though is below average. There was no inflight entertainment; no video nor music. Flight from BKK-MNL was suppose to have a wireless inflight entertainment but was not working. PAL flights seem to be very expensive considering their in-flight service that is similar to low- cost airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,2.0,no,,JFK-YVR. 5/17/2015. First the online check-in didn't work for anyone. I know because I asked a few people in line while waiting an hour for my boarding pass when I only had carry on. The cabin was from 1990s in a bad way. Three TV screens for the cabin no power outlets old interior. The engine broke when we were on the runway they jiggled the cables and rebooted the computers for 5 hours and then decided that the engine really was broken and let us off the plane. They started taking people to hotels and not re-routing / ticketing to other airlines. As soon as I could find an outlet in the terminal I called my booking agent's after hours number and they found a flight through WestJet and I was home in 8 hours through Calgary. I would avoid.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,,I traveled from GUM-MNL stayed one night in MNL then traveled domestically from MNL-DVO then later a return flight from DVO-MNL. The flight experience was so-so no different from any other airline (and I've had my fair share of airlines). The plane was clean enough for its age. Space was adequate (I'm short though 5'2). My only pet peeve is the hidden charges and policies when it comes to excess baggage. Even if you pre-purchase excess baggage they find a way to charge you a bit for the extra weight. For example I bought two extra 30 kg (total 60 kg) excess baggage for MNL-DVO flight since I was in my home base of Guam. When I got to the check-in counter in MNL going to DVO they honored the first 30 kg pre-paid excess but not the second 30 kg excess. Why? Because apparently as per the PAL staff checking me in only one pre-paid excess baggage per person allowed. So why did the PAL in my home base allow me to purchase two prepaid excess baggage while PAL in MNL would not honor this purchase? I ended up paying for the excess baggage and no refunds for the 2ND prepaid baggage. The same happened for DVO-MNL. Got charged $100+ even though I had my prepaid baggage. This airline is very inconsistent. Their main goal really is to make money. You can see it from the start. They don't care about their guests. I recommend using local airlines instead of PAL if travelling domestically. I recommend using any other available airline but PAL if travelling internationally or domestically. The charges aren't as harsh for pretty much the same flight experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,,,2.0,no,4,Food is one of the major factor for me in reviewing an airline and Philippine Airlines food is very poor. First meal ran out of choice and I was given what was left. Second meal was a choice of corned beef or adobo bangus. I don't complain about the seat comfort for economy passengers because you get what you pay for but the plane ticket is always expensive compared with other airlines who offer overall better services. The toilet ran out of water and they would offer a premium of exit seat areas which other don't. The only good thing are the airline ground crew at the check in which were friendly nice and considerate.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,3.0,no,1,PR1846 Cebu to Manila. PR1861 Manila to Cebu. Travelled Business class round trip Cebu to Manila. Ground staff were appalling. No designated area where you have queue up. Everyone just jumped in. Very unfriendly and unwelcoming staff. Worst ground crew staff I have encountered in Cebu and Manila.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,,,4.0,yes,8,BKK-MNL-BKK. Booked online with no hassle on using foreign credit or debit cards. Efficient and trouble-free check-in in both BKK and MNL T2 with a decent 30kg baggage allowance. Both flights on time. Cabin Crew were efficient with a basic but delicious hot meal service. I've had worse food on Business Class on some airlines. Both flights were pretty full which shows PAL are doing something right. Genuine improvements in the airline who are trying hard to be the airline they need to be in today's marketplace. I'll use them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5.0,yes,10,PR427 16th February. I had to fly Philippine Airlines from Tokyo to Taipei (via Manila) after Vanilla Air left me stranded. I booked it at the last minute with a stopover but realised too late that I didn't have six months validity on my passport. Needless to say it was a big mess but all staff were incredibly helpful. They rang the airport in Manila to find out what my options were and to ensure that I wouldn't be sent back and charged a very reasonable amount to change my flight so that I could spend the night at the airport and fly out on the first flight the next morning. They even arranged a vegetarian meal for me at the last minute. I always think the test for a company is when things go wrong and Philippine Air passed this test with flying colours. As for the flight itself sure they're a budget airline but the flight was perfectly comfortable food was good and staff were friendly and efficient both in-flight and especially at the airport in Tokyo. I would definitely fly with them again.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,3.0,no,2,Business class flight from YVR to Manila and back. I boarded the plane first in business class as I am a senior citizen. No one else was in the business class when I boarded immediately a stewardess approached me to ask what I wanted for breakfast. I said just a bun and two small packages of butter. The following morning she handed me a rice porridge. I asked her what happened to my order she looked at me with a blank look and said she would come back in a few minutes. She went through the aisles back and forth ignoring my request. I called a different steward who offered me a croissant and said they ran out of the bun I ordered the day before. The meals inflight were sub-standard pork salted fish fried rice. The drinks were limited to juices and a small selection of wine. The seats are narrow and the pillows were dirty. The head phones were dirty and they wouldn't issue new ones. I've flown many airlines before with PAL next time I'll have to go back to Cathay Pacific.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4.0,yes,8,Economy Class LHR-MNL-LHR. Plane was an A340. 2 meals and 1 snack provided which were fairly good although on the return journey they had run out of the Beef Sandwich (given cake instead) however after a while some more supplies of the Sandwich were found and distributed to those customers who wanted them. Mini hand held IPads were given out early on in the Journey (Both Ways). Seats given on the Outward journey Row 9 and on the Return Journey Row 30 we all sat together. Staff pleasant although no snacks available ie peanuts. All in all fairly pleasant.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,1,I'm a Japanese tourist flown on Tokyo-Manila-Kalibo flight (MNL-KBO was with PAL) It was my first time flying with this airlines and I think I expected too much. The cabin crews were unfriendly and rude. This has been the worst airline I've flown with I felt like I was flying a LCC. The terminal in Manila was pretty small and congested.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,,4.0,yes,8,BKK - Manilla - Kalibo intl and return. Even if flight is supposed to be executed by PAL all airplanes were from Philippine airlines. On time flights and new airbus 320 on the BKK-Manilla flight. Manilla - Kalibo only 45 minutes flying but still very nice airplane. No personal TV on these flights but that was not important. Service friendly food average but surely not better or worse then average European airline. Nice experience surely after reading so many bad comments about this airline. I think they are reliable and would surely fly with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,2.0,no,3,Flew Manila-Melbourne-Manila A330-300 economy 3-3-3 seat configuration. Service is good. Plane is new but I find the seats very narrow and uncomfortable. Can't avoid to brush elbows with your seat mate. I used to take PAL for many years to help economy but I will be avoiding this new A330 by all means. The old A330 and A340 with 2-4-2 seats are more comfortable than this new A330.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5.0,yes,9,Flew round trip Honolulu-Manila and Manila-Cebu on an Airbus 330 and Airbus 321. The airplane was spotlessly clean the seat mechanics were easy to manipulate and the meals were good. The cabin crew on both legs were superb: friendly and knowledgeable. Honolulu is a popular destination for Filipinos as the return flight from Manila was fully booked. Pleasantly surprised at the quality of service. They get a top rating from my experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,4.0,no,3,Very disappointed in the air-line. First of all flying from Melbourne to Manila we received a phone call 45 mins before the flight stating that the air-line had changed the flight time leaving two hours earlier they asked whether I got an email I said no I didn't get that. We were rushed through and made the flight with 5 mins to spare. The planes have no flight entertainment which is very dated. They said they have wi-fi to a watch a movie through your phone but the wi-fi wasn't working 8hr flight with not too much to do very frustrating. Now I'm catching a flight from Manila to Bacolod this flight has been delayed for more than 3hrs the reason no plane! Do yourself a favour and book Qantas or another respected air-line.
,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5.0,yes,9,Flew SIN-MNL-SIN. Onward flight was on time food was so so staff service is great. Return flight was also on time food was good staff service is great. Both flights used A320s which don't have personal IFEs.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,3,This is the second time I used PAL (PR721) on my trip to Manila and I was very disappointed this time around. First off my seat wouldn't recline so I asked one of the steward to move me to another seat. They couldn't find any in my class so I had to stay in my seat for the whole 15-hour flight! I asked instead for two extra pillows to cushion my back since the seat was faulty (plane pillows are incredibly small so I asked for two extras) - no extra pillows. This is the most uncomfortable flight I have been on and I do travel a lot. Next - no personal entertainment system. For a 15-hour international flight from London Heathrow to Manila there were only three overhead screens in our cabin! Needless to say you can't choose what you want to see. Last but by no means least the food was atrocious! Plane food is not the pinnacle of gourmet but I've been on flights (e.g. Emirates JAL Singapore Ethiad even PAL in 2014) where the food was decent. This time it's just appalling. My homebound flight in 20 days is still with PAL so I still have these things to look forward to! Though needless to say I'm flying with other airlines next year and will give PAL a miss.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,5.0,yes,9,MNL-MEL. Airbus A333 that was introduced to the route (plus MNL-SYD) to replace the old A340s. No IFE in economy but if you ask a flight attendant they will usually obtain an iPad should there be spares as these are standard in business class. I moved and had three seats to myself better than the herringbone layout in business. I slept quite well. Food OK unlimited drinks if you so wished. Some turbulence with a conservative Captain leaving the seat belt sign on for longish periods. Punctual which is now typical of southbound and to a lesser extent northbound (due to busy MNL airport) with PAL on its three Australian routes. Cabin crew fine and aircraft (which was only six months old) clean.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,4.0,yes,8,"I'm a frequent flyer with PAL so I will create three reviews under one contribution. (1) A321 Flights MNL-SIN- MNL: I usually go for the ""Choice Seats"" for these flights which cover two or three rows right behind Business Class. This section is lumped together with Business Class so you get extra privacy and are on the ""front"" of the cabin. This also means you get to share the lavatories in the Business Class section so no crowding whatsoever. No IFE in Regular Economy but if you stay in the Choice Seats section the FAs offer an iPad Mini provided there are spare units (it's standard issue to Business flyers) IFE is up to date and had nice choices of Hollywood films and TV shows; Food is fantastic usually the main reason I like flying PAL. (2) A340 Flights MNL-HNL-MNL: Economy seats are pretty standard these are the Iberia planes under lease so you even notice the markings/labels in Spanish. No AVOD which is a pity for an 11 hour flight; Food again is fantastic and service is quite nice. I flew Business on the HNL-MNL leg and seats were pretty good not a full recline but almost and it had a massage function which was excellent. AVOD was available but they also offered iPads - IFE content on the iPads were far better FA service was excellent the food tasted lovely and was a mix of Japanese/Filipino/Western options. Lounge access in HNL was via Delta SkyLounge - this was so-so. (3) A320 Flights SIN-MNL-SINL: this one's pretty standard; No AVOD but the IFE was tolerable with common monitors/screens IFE content was also fine and they played one full-length movie followed by two 20-minute TV shows; food again is pretty good and usually involves Chicken Fish or Beef; some A320 planes have a similar setup with the A321 for Choice Seats where they are located within the front section of the plane and separated from the rest of the Economy Class service is pretty good as well. Probably the factor where PAL beats its competition? The In-Flight Safety Video."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,3.0,yes,7,Flew MNL-CGK-MNL this March 2015. Flight was on a worn-out Airbus 320 with in-flight entertainment. Food was okay but I noticed that PAL has regressed with the quality compared the previous flights. Flights to and from Manila were both slightly delayed. Flight crew were nice courteous and attended to my requests. Price-wise PAL is expensive considering their just satisfactory in-flight service.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,yes,9,March 2015: LHR-MNL-LHR on A340. Despite the poor reviews on this site I experienced a quality level of service from PAL and felt compelled to write a glowing review. Yes the A340 is somewhat on the old side yes it is a bit worn in places but the seat was comfortable there was ample legroom it turned into a flat bed there was power and whilst I have had better inflight entertainment on other airlines there was enough choice and it was AVOD. But where PAL really excelled was in three areas. 1) Value for money 2) Inflight service 3) Meals. All in my opinion were better than you receive in Club World. At LHR you have access to the Etihad lounge we left on time PAL now flies over Russia and China so we arrived in MNL in 12.15 hours rather than the previous 14. On the return leg we left on time and with a journey time of 14 hours. Nothing was too much trouble for the crew. Would I fly with PAL again? Absolutely. Any grumbles? One - headphones were basic and not noise reducing - but that's it. Don't let the other reviews put you off flying with PAL in business on the London route.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,3.0,yes,5,I flew MNL-SYD on 6 March and SYD-MNL on 16 March. Economy class in both directions. Paid an extra US$50 for exit row seats which was worth the money. Flights left and arrived close to schedule. No entertainment options of any kind provided in economy class cabin which for an international flight of more than 7 hours appears to be out of step with other airlines. Overall a satisfactory experience although I feel airline should advise at time of booking that it does not provide any entertainment in the economy class cabin.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4.0,yes,9,"Flew business class on a 777 from Manila to Bangkok. Very pleasantly surprised. Check-in went smoothly. Seats good. IFE adequate. Service and food very good (three nice cuisine options available - ""Western"" ""Asian"" and ""Filipino"" I selected ""Asian"" and was impressed with the quality). Departure and arrival on time. Very good experience overall. The only thing lacking is their participation in an alliance."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,,"Flying return to Tagbilaran with a connection in Manila from Hong Kong. All flights were booked in one booking with Philippine airlines. Prior to leaving on our holiday we had our flight rescheduled 3 times. The final two times were not confirmed with us until after we contacted the airline staff several times asking for a confirmation email 1 day before departure. The final flight scheduled meant we left 1 day earlier and had to spend a night in a hotel in Manila not ideal. Our return journey had our flight from Tagbilaran to Manila cancelled after the departure time of 4.40pm (while we were sitting at the gate) because another airline had not yet taken off from the runway so the PAL flight we were meant to get didn't land and returned to Manila. Philippine airlines considers this ""Force Meajure"" (an act of god) and takes no responsibility informs it's customers the next flight would be at 7.05am the next day and that they would not pay for accommodation until then. We found cheap accommodation nearby for the night returned for our 7.05 am flight the next day which was delayed and departed at 7.30. We arrived in Manila and were expecting to be put on another flight (the original connection was missed because PAL failed to arrange for a flight to pick us up from Tagbilaran in time). Instead we were put on standby for a flight that morning that was overbooked then in the afternoon that was overbooked. All flights were full and no seats were available to myself and my partner. PAL staff continued to claim due to the ""act of god"" (not their poor quality service) they weren't responsible for paying for us to be transferred to another airline. The next non fully booked flight with PAL was not for 2 days and they also would not pay for accommodation or often compensation. Ultimately we took a taxi to another terminal (a much nicer terminal) and bought new tickets with Cebu-Pacific who were very helpful and got us home on time. Never fly Philippine Airlines. There staff were patronizing and unaccommodating their level of customer service was poor and their flights are constantly cancelled and rescheduled."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,,"DAV-MNL-HKG By far the worst airline I have ever travelled with (and I have had my share). Three domestic flights with PAL on the same week all delayed over 2 hours including my flight out of Davao. Surprisingly my connection to Hong Kong was right on time so I missed it. The FAs tell you ""sorry about the delay but we got you here safe!"" They sent me to a hotel more than 1 hour far from the airport. Funny thing is I have had delayed flights from PAL for hours until every passenger appears when other airlines would just leave latecommers but they did not wait for me."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,4.0,yes,8,Manila-Davao Dec 15. The price is the same as Cebu Pacific but PAL offers better service than the latter you are provided biscuits coffee and water on the flight and they leave on time. Was originally on the 4am flight but that got cancelled and passengers were moved to the next Davao flights luckily my friend and I were placed on the very next one (the 8.30 one). We were compensated with full meal breakfast while waiting for the flight. Our flight left on time and arrived in Davao according to schedule. The take-off and landing were superb and smooth. The flying experience is a great improvement the check-in counter and flight crew were professional. My only suggestion for PAL is to make seats more comfortable and to place personal built-in IFE on every seats at least on international flights if they want to compete with other international carriers. The iPad IFE doesn't look like a good idea especially at long haul ergonomically. Traditional seat-installed IFE is still the best way to go. As long as they don't have IFE on their international flights will still continue to take foreign carriers when I go abroad.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,,2.0,no,2,Business Class Melbourne-Manila-LHR. July 2014. The Lounge in MEL is one of the best lounges in Melbourne. The flight to Manila was excellent on all counts. No problem getting out of the airport. We found meter taxis are the best value and convenient. We stayed at the New World in Makati which we can recommend. The flight to England was the same experience and we were saying at that stage that PAL was really good value. Then it all went downhill on our return flights in September. PAL uses Malaysia Airlines Lounge in London and it was just okay. On the flight (late) my seat was broken and would not recline I was moved to another seat but the media unit didn't work so they gave me a Ipad. The seat headrest abutted the toilet and the constant flushing made sleep almost impossible. We were very glad to get to our hotel in Manila and get some sleep. The flight back to Melbourne from Manila was delayed for hours. Guess what! I had exactly the same experience on the flight to Melbourne broken seats and media units. I complained and was given 30000 Pal frequent flyer points as compensation.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,,4.0,yes,9,This was a codeshare with Vietnam Airlines for the second leg from HCM to MAN was surprised at the level of high quality service previously I have been unimpressed with PAL on their short flights. I didn't expect any entertainment on a 2 hrs flight so wasn't surprised when there wasn't any also didn't expect a meal but was served with a very good and tasty fish dish served with unlimited beer!
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,,2.0,no,1,I traveled on the 28th of Dec 2014 for a month LHR-MNL and back. It is such a shame that PAL is using an old A340-300 acquired from Iberia which is more or less 15 years old already. The aircraft does not have IFE built in on their seats they provide ipad mini's though but they have a very poor choice of entertainment system. The upholstery is totally worn out stained and the aircraft itself looks so dirty. PAL should do something about these problems as it is a shame to flying customers especially foreigners who wants to visit the Philippines. As a flag carrier they should improve their services because as what the saying goes first impression always lasts. Never again with PAL on a LHR-MNL flight unless they start using the 777-300er again!
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,,,3.0,yes,6,BKK-MNL Economy. I usually try and avoid PAL due to their poor reliability but it was the only flight I could get. Check-in in BKK was efficient and the flight left on time. The price was good and I think the competition from Cebu Pacific is doing this. Food was surprisingly good but there was no IFE on a 3hr+ flight. Cabin service was nothing special with the crew seeming oblivious to passengers cluttering up the aisles in order to chat to each other. Personally I prefer to spend the flight watching a movie or reading a book rather than having somebody's backside in my face. T2 arrivals in MNL was reasonably efficient.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5.0,yes,8,PR 427 on 2nd January 2015. My 1st flight with this Airline and was pleasantly surprised. Fantastic service and food and brand new airplane (2months old). But amazingly no in seat flight entertainment only a supplied Ipad no route map at all (my favorite). The seat was impossibly uncomfortable unless in the full bed configuration! After 10 minutes I started to feel pain! How is it possible? Who designs those seats? Hard as wood!
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,1.0,no,,Poor from start to finish: Baggage allowance increased to 30 kgs from 1 July 2014 but is only applicable if the tickets were purchased after 1 July - had to offload one bag or pay £600 excess. No apologies from carrier and no literature from carriers representatives at LHR that showed this clause. Seats were damaged and IFE did not work. Return flight two hours delay with no reason. Delay to LHR from main hub totally unacceptable. Carrier evidently does not realise it will lose its customers with service like this. SQ here we come next time. Goodbye PAL.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,,,1.0,no,2,Philippine Airlines have a very long way to go if they are ever to be considered seriously on the long haul route from MNL to LHR. Seats are too narrow leg room is very limited. I have been flying Europe to Asia and back frequently since 2006 and they rank well below SQ EK BA KLM CG and Malaysia Airlines. Food is dreadful - poor quality tasteless lack of variety and on my flights to BKK SGN and BKK over the past 3 months they always run out of food choices. There is absolutely no reason why the cabin crew should not understand simple requests. It wasn't even a cheap ticket this time round. Basic courtesy and attentiveness is non existent no blanket is given.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,,3.0,no,5,I flew from SIN-MNL Sunday (01-04-15). Onboard there was no IFE AVOD no IPAD's and no headsets were distributed to us on a sophisticated A321 plane. Their seat was also tight you can't stretch your feet out very well reclining of seats are very difficult to use and when you recline the seats they squeak. The service has been improved over the past years FA's are accommodating however the purser was not accommodating.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,,1.0,no,2,Whilst in the Philippines we had to arrange 3 separate flights around the country and back to the UK. Never again will I travel with this incompetent airline x1 late by 3 hrs x2 charged £90 (5000 peso's) for two suitcases (38kg) that I couldn't book on via their website x3 pre booked seats the day before flying out of Manila to LHR. When we arrived at the airport they said they had overbooked and wanted volunteers to take a flight two days later but with the compensation package of two rtn flight tickets. In the end 15 mins prior to departure they upgraded us to business class sounds nice and it was but surely they need to get their act together and not overbook a flight on 5th Jan 2015 one of the busiest days for returning.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,3.0,no,,My flight was delayed by approximately 3 hours from Puerto Princesa to Manila International airport. The offered reason was due to traffic congestion in Manila. However while we waited Cebu Pacific and Air Asia both sent at least three flights to Manila International Airport. Employees were prompt to try to expedite my connection. However the flight was so delayed that I missed my connection and was forced to spend a night in Manila. The employees were able to arrange a hotel within an hour and to put me on a flight very early the next morning. However the hotel they arranged (Palm Plaza) was located approximately 1 hour away from the airport! Why would they choose this hotel when there are multiple hotels right across the street from the airport. Other points of note. When I arrived in Manila they forgot to put the connecting passengers checked-in baggage on the baggage claim which significantly delayed us. The planes used for domestic flights are extremely cramped. You will be very lucky to fit your knees into the seats. I would highly advise not using this airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,2.0,no,3,Flew PAL from BKK-MNL last December 2. There was no in-flight entertainment - no music nor videos. I felt like flying a low cost carrier. Baggage was released very late; it took more than an hour before my luggage appeared at thr carousel. PAL has become an inconsistent airline in terms of service.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,4.0,yes,6,Average domestic flight with this airline. Snack offerings are chips but the peanuts disappeared and a rather limited choice of drinks (water tea or coffee). If you wanted more you could buy from their buy-on-board menu which was rather limited. The overhead screens that you usually see on PAL's A320s have disappeared too. Cabin crew were fine and the seat is comfortable for a short route. Overall I'm happy to fly this airline again.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,yes,10,Melb-Manila in Business on A340 Aircraft. Seated in front row of Business Class with more leg-room than I have ever had in my life. Seats more than comfortable but a little old fashioned. Service from the impeccably dressed crew was excellent with a wide range of food and wine on the menu. Flight departed on time and landed 10 minutes early. Just be prepared for the chaos that is Manila airport!. Overall a terrific flight which ticked all the things you need when traveling in Business Class. Can say I would certainly fly with them again if this flight is any indication.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,3.0,yes,5,Flew PAL from Bangkok to MNL 3 December. Food was good seats ok but major disappointment was the lack of in- flight entertainment. There were no videos nor audio entertainment. PAL has to be consistent with their service.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,5.0,yes,8,MNL-KIX-MNL. I was pleasantly surprised. It was my first trip on them and I would fly them again. For starters my ticket was very inexpensive so that is always a plus. It was actually less expensive on Philippine Air than some of the other local budget carries and I got to check a bag for free. Departed Manila on time and arrived in Osaka about 35 minutes ahead of schedule. Meal was Japanese Curry Beef which was tasty and the mango jelly that came with it was delicious. The one disappointing thing is only one drink service but they did give me the entire can of soda so can't complain about that. During my stay in Osaka I got the news of typhoon heading towards the Philippines so I decided to change the ticket last minute to get back earlier and the change fee was only 100 USD which in this day and age is amazing. There was also no increase in fare. The crew on the flight home did a really commendable job as the circumstances they were dealing with could have been trying. I have never been on a flight where the seat belt sign was on almost the entire time it was 4 hours of bumps turbulence and grabbing the seat handles but the crew despite being interrupted 3 times and having to return to their seats were able to complete their meal service clean up and duty free. I had the pork dish which wasn't bad and the fruit platter was refreshing and quite good. I am a big fan of their inflight entertainment concept - they don't have the usual movie screens (at least not on the A330) but instead you can stream from their library right into your tablet laptop or MAC however their library left a lot to be desired. I really think their system is the new way to go but they need to improve the selection of films. They also offer in flight WiFi but I did not use. I'm not sure what their selection is like on their long haul flights but they could upgrade to some more modern movies on the short international routes. They're not the best airline in Asia I've flown but they're not that far behind either. The food was good service good and planes clean. The inflight entertainment concept is cool but needs improvement. I would definitely fly them again.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4.0,yes,9,PR 730 (MNL-BKK) economy and PR 737 (BKK-MNL) business. Outbound on a new A330-300. Tight seats no seatback entertainment but plane is equipped with streaming videos which you were supposed to be able to stream to your wireless devices after downloading an app (which we did not do). Since I pack my iPad with movies it really wasn't an issue for me. Seats were a bit cramped. FAs were friendly and helpful especially in trying to sort out the streaming issue. Food was good considering. Delayed out of the gate because of an interlock issue with the doors but arrived BKK on time. Inbound MNL in J class. Same if not friendlier service from FAs. Seat was a recliner with a personal video screen with an OK selection of entertainment options. Food was pretty good and the drinks were always refilled. Haagen Dazs ice cream for dessert was a nice touch. While I loathe taking domestic PAL flights they more than make up for it in their international ones. Now if only they can do something about the congestion in T2 which is exclusive for their use.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5.0,yes,9,PR721 London to Manila 25 October PR720 Manila to London 12 November. A340-300 both ways. 2 hours late laving Heathrow but we arrived in Manila on time. The flight was only about 65% full and my son and I were lucky as we had all 4 seats in the middle section to ourselves. Seat recline seemed limited. The A340 is clearly an older plane - no seat back videos but passengers are issued with iPads for the duration of the flight which are pre- loaded with games and films. The staff were friendly and helpful. The catering was fine - 2 full meals and a snack. Getting to Manila non stop is a real selling point for PAL. Return - big plus point is that PAL uses Terminal 2 at NAIA which is a dream compared to Terminal 1. Again half empty flight and I had 4 seats to myself! Again 2 meals and a snack. Staff were good no complaints. I was a bit wary before I travelled as I had read some poor reviews of the PAL flight from London and I had always used Emirates / Cathay / Singapore / Thai before. The lack of seatback videos is solved by the iPads. The staff didn't come round with water that much. So long as the price is right I would certainly use PAL again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,,4.0,yes,8,MNL-LGP return. Problems with web check in. Website couldn't find my reservation. Although the call centre and airport ground staff were helpful and friendly PAL should improve the online check in portal. Service friendly on this short hop even if it was just biscuits and coffee/tea. Delayed both legs on the tarmac and landing in MNL due to congestion and issues on the ground at LGP but that's not PAL's fault. Overall a good experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,4.0,yes,9,Short Hop TAC-MNL and onwards AUH with codeshare partner Etihad. Arrived well ahead of time in the airport and bags drop off was a breeze given that it was a small plane - they use a Q4000. Bags was over weight but the fee was reasonable upon hearing that I have an onward flight they made sure my bags get to the destination and tagged as priority. Flight was slightly delayed due to bad weather in TAC. Boarding was swift and organized and cabin info was adequate. Snacks were served which is nothing to write home about but its the little things that count. Most other airline with the same fare don't even serve snacks. Flight was smooth and bags came out first. Transfer airside courtesy of PAL bus to T1 was a godsend. All in all was a good flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,,4.0,yes,8,RUH-MNL-RUH on 2-Oct and return on 24-Oct. Both flights were on time. Food was ok especially on the return which served 3x on a 9.5 hrs flight 1 hot meal and 2 snacks. Seats were narrow and is not suitable for taller plus size people.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,,4.0,yes,6,Why have PAL started using old A340's on long haul flights to London? We flew Manila on September 29 2014 and frankly I was shocked when I got on board and saw no entertainment screens in the seats! Come on! This is long haul on a large scale! 15 hours. OK you gave out tablets to passengers that wanted them but to hold in your hand for hours on end is not good. Please get your act together PAL on this long laborious journey! Bring back the 777! Or we wont use you again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,,5.0,yes,9,The service is good. Comfortable seats. Friendly cabin crews. Very good airport shuttle bus for connecting flight no need to get a taxi to transfer from terminal 2 to T3. Basic snacks provided. Good value for money.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,2.0,no,4,I'm a Mabuhay Elite member and fly around 30000 miles a year on PAL. Most often I fly Tokyo - Manila and Manila - General Santos City but have also flown on PAL from Manila - London and Manila - Bali. Sometimes I fly Economy and sometimes Business. Yesterday (October 12) I flew Business in PR432 Manila - Tokyo NRT. The plane is an A330-300 with 3-3-3 seating in Economy and Premium Economy and 2-2-2 seating in Business. The IFE is wireless and video choices are very limited (Ice Age and Avatar). You would not want to be in either Economy or Premium Economy if the flight was full. The seats are very narrow and if you are of average body width you will be pressing shoulders hard with the person sitting next to you. Business Class uses PAL's new herringbone seating which is the worst Business Class seating I have experienced in recent times. The seats are narrow the herringbone layout means you are angled towards the person next to you and so is he/she angled towards you. You will not want to work on anything confidential because he/she can easily read your notebook screen. The layout would be great for romantic couples who want to be close to each during the flight but for business-people? The flight attendants do an excellent job and both food and wine are very good but 2-2-2 seating in a modern A340 is unacceptable compared to the 1-2-1 many airlines use in A330s and A340s. PAL used to fly 777s on the Manila - Tokyo route and that was a very enjoyable experience both in Business and in Economy which again indicates that PAL's fleet modernization has everything to do with reducing fuel costs but nothing to do with passenger comfort. I am dreading being in a PAL A340 to London next month.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,4.0,yes,9,Flight was an Etihad codeshare from Dammam to TAC although PAL operated the MNL to TAC sector check in was a breeze since I was already checked from Abu Dhabi still the counter staff were very friendly and accommodating and very informative since the flight will be on a Bombardier Q400 due to operational restrictions in Tacloban airport meaning luggage weights were restricted. Staff explained the issue and possible solution airport utilized was the new T3 terminal and it was well marked. Boarding was a breeze though we were bussed to the aircraft- boarding was organized. The aircraft itself was small the seats were a 2-2 configuration but very comfortable and had wide legroom take off was slightly delayed due to congestion but it was smooth. Snacks served were adequate for an hours flight minimal cockpit info and the attendants were efficient landing was a but bumpy due to slightly windy weather. Bags were out in less than 10 minutes. All in all a good flight cant wait to have the airport renovation finished so that the bigger A320 are used.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5.0,yes,9,Flew from MNL to SFO and return on the 4th and 16th September. Check in a breeze as was the lounge. Totally uneventful flight with happy and very willing to please attendants. Champagne was nice and cold and the wine was quite acceptable. Plane was 777 and the seats almost lay flat but I got 5 hours sleep both ways. Movies were so so but some reasonable old classics. Very good value for money in fact I try to fly PAL whenever I am able. I would recommend PAL.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,5.0,yes,7,Short flight from Manila to Caticlan. Flight was slightly delayed but gave out snacks as a way of apology. Value for money and would recommend the airline.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5.0,yes,10,We flew Singapore-Manila-Vancouver then returned Vancouver-Manila-Bali in Business class. Check in was easy and efficient and lounges good. The service was just excellent - smiling efficient made you feel like a valued customer. Flight from Manila to Vancouver was on a 777 and return on an A340. Same lay flat beds same great service and no discernible difference. My wife and I got a good 6-7 hours very comfortable sleep on each long leg. All in all great value for money and we will recommend and fly Philippine again.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,2.0,no,3,Flight 538 DPS-MNL Sep 20. Flight 116 MNL-YVR Sep 20. Only one bad children's movie played from a screen in the middle of the plane at the beginning. No more movies for the rest of the 10 hrs. They ran out of the meal I wanted then forgot to give it to me so 30 minutes later I had to ask. They have no alcohol except bad wine and bad beer. For a 12 hour flight it was horrible. Delayed flight of course and a bad terminal in Manila. Not worth the money cause for a little bit more money you can get a normal international flight with actual service and entertainment.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,yes,9,This is our first PAL experience (January 2014). We travel to Manila twice a year via AC/ANA. Check-in was hassle free. Flight and service were excellent. Staff made us feel comfortable. Food was delicious. Lounge was okay. Seats were very comfortable. Managed to get good sleep which is important to us in long flights less jet lag. Will fly PAL again before Christmas! Hoping service and flight quality won't change under LT Group management.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,5.0,yes,9,I flew from Manila to Hong Kong. I was pleasantly surprised about PAL. The food was very good. Unfortunately the portion was too little and there was no appetizer salad such example but the dessert was very nice. The drink selection was great. All in all the quality of the food was very good. My seat was spacious enough although I'm tall. The flight attendants were cheerful and friendly and they were always ready for a smile. The toilets were clean and spacious. There was no IFE but for almost 2 hours flight it was not important in my opinion. Newspapers were distributed. The flight departed on time and arrived on time. Especially on this point i was really surprised.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4.0,yes,6,HK-Manila return. Outbound new A330 business seats in reverse herringbone configuration. Fully flat seats however seats are quite narrow. IFE provided by ipad which is quite inconvenient having to hold or stare down when placed in table top. Tried their premium economy seats quite surprising it had very good legroom and recline. Could compete with narrow-body plane's business class if only they had IFE. Inbound on an old A340 Tears are all over the seams of the seats no IFE. Musty smell all over. Redeeming factor is the seat pitch. Really needs to be decommissioned as it is a disgrace to PAL's fleet. Food in both sector fair but not great. Cabin crew provided typical Filipino hospitality and are efficient.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,3.0,no,6,I flew from Manila to Heathrow on a 777 my return was on an old Airbus A340. To say the airbus was substandard would be an understatement in an age of carriers using modern up to date planes this was a great disappointment. London is a prime capital city. To look to increase passengers especially from the west you really have to up your game. There is no personal screen (the replacement was a small iPad to use which meant holding it while viewing it not easy hour after hour on a long haul flight) my fold down table was broken the seat was really uncomfortable the toilets were not kept clean. I have flown China Southern and even this carrier had a better plane. I am not in a position to use business class but still expect a certain amount of service for my ticket money.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5.0,yes,9,MNL-SIN-MNL. Check-in in both airports were fast and efficient. Lounge in MNL is a great improvement from its contemporaries in T1 and T3 in MNL. Seats were standard 20 inch width and 38 inch pitch. Service in the air was great. F/A addressed me by name and were more than happy to provide refills. Flights on time and ahead of schedule. Only complaint would be IFE was a bit limited with few films and TV shows. Overall a great experience with PAL.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,,,3.0,no,3,I flew with PAL on a new 777 PR721 Business class the seat was very hard and the food very poor the lounge at LHR Malaysia Airlines was also very poor I have also noted that on my return trip on 21st September 2014 that I will be flying on a 15 year old A340 which I am led to believe is an ex-Iberia plane that PAL have leased. I suppose that when I complain they'll say that the plane was changed for operational reasons. I think that they are going to lose a lot of customers from the UK.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,no,,PR731 BKK to MNL on Aug 25th. I am a very tall overweight guy. I simply do not fly economy ever. PAL changed the plane to the very cramped A330 with no business class available. Wish they had told me in advance so I could have bought a business ticket with Thai. At the counter they gave me 150 usd credit per ticket which in no way covers the fare difference I had paid. They said even with Premium Economy seats they would give Business service. Not true at all. Seats are a nightmare food was horrible and I got a cranky face when I asked for a drink refill. They can keep their money because I'm not flying PAL again which should be tricky living in Manila but doable.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,no,2,PR 118 August 20 2014 Manila-Vancouver-Toronto. Everything went well until we reached Vancouver airport. The airplane didn't land smoothly we found out later on there was something wrong with the aircraft. We were in our seats just waiting for our flight to Toronto while the pilot announced we were going to have a short delay of 2 hours. They served us a meal. An hour after a meal they announced again that we should leave the airplane with all our hand carry luggage. We were kept in a small part of airport. 5 hour delay by that time. Told the delay would be 7 hours by this time. It was around 7pm. We supposed to be in Toronto by 9.30 pm. We went to the baggage claim and waited an hour for our things. Then they made us line up for food vouchers for almost 2 hours. Given 15$ each. 12.30 we were lined up to check our luggage in again. The line was pretty long and it moved so slowly. We got on the plane at 3 am. We got to Toronto but our luggage was late. We got out of airport at almost 12 noon. More than 13 hour delay.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5.0,yes,9,Flew from Denpasar to Manila PR538 31 March and was pleasantly surprised. Staff service was perky crisp and efficient which is not the usual PAL service of ten or even five years ago. The flight was full and since it was a red eye flight I did not have full use of the IFE. Price is affordable and even got my excess baggage charges waived because the handling agent in Ngurah Rai were so slow in checking in passengers that it was almost near boarding time. Above-average if not most improved.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,1,I am a regular business class traveler on the London - Manila sector and was happy that Philippine Airlines introduced a direct flight from London to Manila. Travelled on the London - Manila - London sectors several times from early December 2013 and was generally happy with the 777 comfort. However my recent journey from Manila to London was terrible. Evidently Philippine Airlines started using 15 year old A340 planes on the route in early August that appears to be part of the problem - slower plane takes 1.5 hours longer than the 777 now only 2 hours faster than quality Middle Eastern carriers very poor seats no full pull down separators between adjacent seats no current affairs or news programs on the in-seat media system - understand the programs are only changed every 2 months only 3 small toilets for business class with old scoured and discoloured wash basins. Very basic food compared to alternative carriers. Philippine Airlines are selling upgrades from economy to business at the airport for $500 which is then $500 less than a business ticket purchased online. Advised that only 14 business class seat had been sold but business was full - presumably passengers took the $500 check in upgrade. Philippine Airlines need to decide whether it wants to be a budget or premium player in the airline business. Needless to mention that I will not travel again with Philippine Airlines on the London - Manila route.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,yes,10,PR721 LHR-MNL 9 June 2014. Flight was on time and we arrived in Manila ahead of schedule. Return from Manila to London was on time as well. Great food service etc. I was very satisfied.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,3.0,no,4,June 14 2014 flight 731. Everything was fine on the plane except there was no proper inflight entertainment. Only a few TV screens in the middle row of the plane (I was expecting PAL to be better than AA). Anyway the food was horrible and was very bland. The seat was okay. MNL airport was ugly.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,no,1,"I flew from SFO-MNL-SFO only because of the direct flight schedule. I've flown most of the airlines in the Star Alliance Sky Team and OneWorld and it is with extreme disappointment to say that PAL does not come close to the level of any of the airlines in these groups. PAL fare is significantly higher being on schedule is an issue (I can't believe that the one time I had to fly PAL both inbound and outbound flights were delayed! On the inbound flight the pilot says after passengers are boarded ""we have a mechanical failure your safety is our concern so we will be delayed on take off for at least an hour"". The flight attendants have an attitude - they see you struggling with your luggage and stare at you. I asked an FA for water she looked annoyed that I asked her for something and to top it off she never came back with the water. They must be cutting back on food (considering how much more expensive they are compared to other airlines) - by the middle row there were no choices left - you just have to take what they give you!"
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,,,4.0,yes,9,Flew from MNL-MPH-MNL-TUG. Uneventful flights except for a 90 minute delay on NAIA (very congested airport and needs to be shut down). What made a difference is how the airline immediately accepted my sister's medical equipment even though it is a bit overweight. This was unlike Emirates (IAD-DXB) where they made us wait until the flight was about to board when they finally accept her medical machine/supplies. And yes I do agree that PAL has good landings.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,,,4.0,yes,9,Travelled SIN-MNL-SIN. Flight to MNL was rescheduled twice. PR's A321 has not IFE which is quite disappointing. Then I asked the crew for a blanket and said there are no more blankets. Food was ok. Then MNL-SIN is on time. Only complain is that they ran out of wine. But PR's landing are the best. Very smooth.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,2.0,no,3,MNL-SYD. This was a horrendous flight! The plane was older and rattly. Luckily it was a night time flight and most was spent asleep. If this was my first time on Philippine Airlines I would never travel with them again! But luckily this is the first time I've had a bad thing to say about them.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4.0,yes,7,SYD-MNL - This flight was wonderful it was very comfortable the staff were very courteous and helpful. The plane was a newer one and had all the comforts.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,,"I booked business class SFO-MNL-BKK only to have them ""downgrading"" my seat without notifying me. I booked business class and PAL flies me coach and hopes I won't figure it out. I called and they offered very little in the way explanation other options or compensation. They don't seem to have any concept of customer service. When I asked to speak to a reservation supervisor I was told they don't have one tonight. They simply don't care if they fail."
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,1,We decided to fork out the money for business class because one of us has a medical problem so needs leg room. What a waste of money. The seats were angled downwards so you are continuously sliding down your seat. Very uncomfortable to sleep. Seats are very close together (old airplane) so if you are seated next to a stranger be prepared to climb over someone or have them climb over you. Food options ran out (and we were seated in the front section) so we could not get the food we wanted. The inflight entertainment was outdated no new movies! Also one of our screens (we were a family of 4 traveling) was not working. 3 out of our 4 reading lights were not working. The business class lounge of Philippine Airlines is a joke. Not a lot of food options and insufficient quantities. The lounge in San Francisco looks worse than an outdated dentist office and the hot food was placed out on the counter (no cover at all). Of course it was cold within minutes. Anything that ran out was just that: finished. Nothing was replenished. So once people got that the food ran out even faster. Same for the few cans of juice in the fridge. But the worst part really was the business class cabin. It is like going back in time 20 years. The arm rest of my seat was completely ripped. On the way from Manila to SFO they did not have the business class packs (with the socks etc) so we received the economy class bags. Not a good look at all! On both trips the food ran out according to the staff they simply do not get enough to stock their kitchens with. For breakfast it was oriental fare only - no Western choices at all. The staff are continuously apologizing and they seem genuinely uncomfortable. The reading lights for instance were reported by them countless times. And then nothing happens. If I compare this with other airlines Philippine Airlines gets a zero out of 10!
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5.0,yes,8,Flew SIN-MNL-SIN. SIN-MNL was good. The FAs are really nice. Food is superb. MNL-SIN is okay. FAs for the return flight are not as pleasant as the SIN-MNL leg. Food is still superb. Both sectors used new A320 planes which don't have personal screens. There's an overhead screen though. The seats are a bit cramped. I feel like I'm flying on an LCC.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,yes,10,Great service non stop LHR to Manila and back. Flights on time staff pleasant and efficient. Will only use this airline for future trips to Philippines!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,yes,9,I was going to Boracay in April and came back to Hong Kong with 1 stop over at Manila. We flew a 747-400 jumbo jet for an old plane the cabin looked clean and new. There was AVOD/IFE capability personal TV screens it worked well and cabin staff were warm and friendly and the food was good. There was one slight problem though it was delayed for about 30 minutes to 1 hour. I would definitely fly them again the flight was quite full. The 747 is absolutely the queen of the skies.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,4.0,yes,10,Very good experience over all. Being married to a Filipino we find travel by PAL the most convenient. On trips from Toronto to Manila and back there is a short stop in Vancouver and back on the same plane. Flight attendants stewardesses and all others were friendly and helpful. On arrival to Vancouver my wife and I were moved to business class for the remainder of the trip to Manila free of charge. All in all a really good travel experience. My one complaint if I could think of any would be the food although that would be very nit picking of me. I'm not a big fan of Filipino foods though the ones they served I'm sure were prepared well. My wife enjoyed what they served as well as I'm sure 99% of the other people on board. My opinion on food should not be important here perhaps because most who fly this airline will love the food. We will continue to fly PAL when ever possible and build up our air miles. So far it has been a really good experience for us and everything has been as advertised or better.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,,In April this year by boyfriend and I flew Philippine Airlines and without a doubt the worst most disorganised airline I've ever traveled with. First the flights were rescheduled to nearly 4 hours earlier than originally planned and we were not notified no email no call nothing. I only found out because I checked the airport flight times to see what gate we would have to board from. My boyfriend and I were both travelling on connecting flights which meant we would not make our new flight times. We had to rearrange our connecting flights and fork out a lot of money to change these. Secondly online states that everyone will have ipads to watch TV/movies on. No this was not the case either. There were 3 TV's in our section of they plane and I'm not talking out 3 TV's per row I'm talking about 3 TV's for the entire section. Also these TV's were not made in the 2000's they were at least 20+ years old. I felt like I was watching a video rather than a DVD or anything of quality. All in all worst experience I've had with an airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,3.0,no,3,Return trip (4 sectors) with transit in Manila experienced delays of between 15 minutes to 2 hours. When final connection could not be made staff rebooked the next delay resulting in 11 hour overnight transit in Manila. When I requested where I would be accommodated they advised I would have to wait in terminal! After an hour of arguing and being told that no managers are available they acknowledged they would accommodate me in Manila overnight with transport and meals. Accommodation was appalling. I am sorry PAL passengers are customers maybe you could notify your staff about this.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,1,PR430 from MNL-NRT was operated by an A321-200 registered as RP-C9906. There were no delays and luggage came out just after immigration at Narita. The plane was hot the leather seats are too warm and not comfortable. There was no IFE nor PTV's even iPad's were not available. The food was very bad. I will never fly PAL's A321 again.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5.0,yes,9,I am a regular business cabin flier usually clocking up between 4 and 5 long haul flights a month. I flew Philippine airlines Jakarta to Manila and Manila to London on July 5 2014. The latter leg is a 14.5 hour flight. Having read some of the reviews on this site I was an exceptionally reluctant flier and in fact protested belatedly at the choice of airline. I will be apologising to my agent for my complaints. The service on the flight was exceptional staff were professional courteous and always helpful in spite of some difficult requests (I chose to anticipate change in time zones by sleeping and eating at all the wrong times). The food was great wine was good cabin and toilets spotless. Although the seats don't recline all the way it is flat bed at a slight angle and perfectly acceptable for sleeping. They have a relatively sparse choice of inflight movies and shows only somewhat compensated for with loan iPads for the flight with additional choices so if are a big consumer of inflight entertainment it may be worth bringing your own especially given the length of the flight. Both flights were on time transfer at Manila faultless if surprisingly personal (escort for most of it) - this in spite of only a 1hour 10 minute layover. Check-in at Jakarta is through a dedicated business class channel which includes immigration. In all a great experience. I realise two flights don't make a big sample but I am happy to recommend until I experience differently.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,4.0,yes,6,PR501 MNL-SIN 1 Jul 14. Flight was delayed 2 hours they were to rebook me on Singapore Airlines flying out of T1 at 16.50 but the check in counter had already closed and they apologized to me. However I had noticed a spark of attitude shown towards me by the Ground Staff at Philippine Airlines. Paid 100SGD to change the flight to an earlier date and time so with the delay I was rather angry and frustrated at them. They had changed the aircraft in use nearly 4 times. Departed at 6 instead of original 3.30pm. Have to say crew and the flight to Singapore was good. PAL needs to work on their ground crew customer service.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,5.0,yes,10,Flight PR502 SIN-MNL. Inbound Aircraft had a sight delay other than that fantastic for the boarding welcome by the crew and the service received. Inflight meal was fantastic paid additional 20SGD for the Front Row extra legroom. This seat offered as forward seating choice economy seat. IFE needs some work though overhead screens are too old for the current generation and instead all seats should be equipped with IFE'S. Will fly them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,no,,"On February 10 I flew from SFO on PR105 which was initially supposed to be a direct flight to Manila. Upon arriving at SFO we were instructed that we had to make a ""tech stop"" in Guam. My first concern was not making it on time in Manila to make my connecting flight but we were notified that the flight was going to arrive in Manila around 5.30am. So then the flight left but encountered a 2hr delay in flying out of SFO. We made our 'tech stop' in Guam but then arrived Manila around 7.30am instead of the previously scheduled time which was 5.30am. As a result I missed my connecting flight with another airline and had to purchase another ticket to flight out of Manila. My original flight was PR105 SFO to Manila arriving at 3.30am!"
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,,,3.0,no,2,CEB-MNL - normally fly Business class but when booking my ticket 2 months in advance surprised that my agent said no Business class available. But on the 17th when I flew there was indeed business class but this cabin had been taken up by PAL employee trainees by the looks of things so they have no sense of putting the paying passengers/Mabuhay flyers first in this cabin. So to any business class passenger be warned you maybe bumped into Economy.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,3.0,yes,6,MNL-LHR-MNL in business class. We flew on PAL's new 777 but the cabin looks old. Both on the way to LHR and back to MNL the controls to the AVOD did not work. The headphones also had problems. Limited movie selection. The seats do not lie fully flat there is a slight angle. The food is good but the portions are small. On the way back they ran out of choices. On the LHR-MNL leg it appeared that the FAs were new on the job and appeared nervous were stumbling a lot and did not know how to properly serve.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5.0,yes,9,BKK-MNL. Older A330 but immaculately clean inside. Nice lunch including ice cream. IFE on overhead monitors rather than seat back TV screen. Not much full service competition on this route only other choices being Thai or Kuwait Airways. PAL were the cheapest and I was very happy with them will definitely use again.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,3.0,yes,7,My wife and I have flown between the US and Manila-Cebu several times. We always fly Philippine Airlines as the service and non-stop flight from LAX to MAN is unequalled by other airlines. Overall we have been very happy with the service of PAL with one exception: The Airport at Manila is intolerable. There is now no Air Conditioning in most of the terminals as those in charge of this airport have let these units go into disrepair. We are seriously considering changing to another airline that fly's directly into Cebu to avoid the Manila Airport. If this does not change this year we will not be flying Philippine Airlines again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,,5.0,yes,7,RUH-MNL in a single all-Y-class configuration. Plane was a new A330 high density configuration meaning seats are cramped. No entertainment for 9.5 hours direct flight. Food was OK though and punctuality is commendable.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,4.0,no,6,"Rating Philippine Airlines is like rating two separate airlines. My wife and I flew Bacolod - Manila - Hong Kong return out May 24 return May 28. In common with all recent flights there were very long delays in and out of Manila on PAL Express and a complete inability to keep passengers informed. I eventually left the Bacolod departure lounge and spoke to the very charming apologetic and unimpressive station manager to suggest they at least update the flight departure time with their best estimate and employ someone who spoke clearly on the communication system. Again in common with my recent experience the international flights were punctual. Along with many other passengers we were so cold on the flights we asked for blankets - on both flights they ran out!! The apologetic hostess explained this had been reported many times but ""passenger feedback reports were not being acted upon"". I am booked to Thailand in June and London in September and am fearing the worst for delays - I will bring my own blanket."
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,no,1,"MNL-CEB return. A330 both ways delayed both ways. One hour on the MNL-CEB leg and almost 3 hours on the CEB MNL leg. Seats were cramped service (which was supposed to set it apart from ""budget airlines"") consisted of inedible nuts and warm water (or coffee). Since domestic routes were taken over by PAL express they did away with business class and started treating passengers like cattle. I can't find any justification choosing PR over Cebu Pacific in the domestic route."
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,1.0,no,5,Bangkok-Manila-Bangkok in business. As expensive as Thai Airways but that is the only comparison. A poor business product in terms of seat food and service. Not worth the money and ground staff at Manila in my opinion not a good advertisement for this airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,,,1.0,no,1,5th April 2014 London to Manila PR721. 7th April 2014 Manila to Puerto PR2781. 15th April 2014 Puerto to Manila PR2782. 15th April 2014 Manila to Davao PR2817. 20th April 2014 Davao to Manila PR2820. 21st April 2014 Manila to London PR720. Four of us flew to the Philippines and out of our 6 flights (2 international and 4 domestic) all were delayed. All our itineraries were affected because of it. Also the PAL domestic flight has 2 terminals which is so inconvenient for the passengers who have local connecting flight from one island to another.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,2.0,no,3,MNL to LAX flight. They have 2 flights to LAX daily now but they have stopped using 747's instead they are using the old AirBus. Old means smelly rest room no personal entertainment and very limited complimentary services. Old leased plane limited to non-existent entertainment system poorly maintained rest rooms and complimentary service that are limited. They are not that cheap there are other airlines that offers the same price and they have newer planes better service and good food. Here's the catch if you want to go on a long haul flight Do you want to ride a 15 yr. old leased Airbus? The only good side is the non-stop flight to LAX and that's it.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,3.0,no,5,Took this flight from SFO-MNL non-stop. I chose this Airline because it was a non-stop flight and I didn't have to worry about transferring my luggage during a connecting flight. Flight attendants didn't smile a lot. It seemed that they looked very tired of what they're doing. Meals were fair but nothing special. The seats were okay but not very comfortable for a 14-hour flight. IFE was very poor. My headphone jack was broken and I could barely hear the movie I was watching. It turned out that the jack in my seat was the problem. Also not all the lavatories were in a working condition. 2 in the middle were out of order 1 lavatory at the back produced a strong odor of cigarette smell. Not all the amenities were complete.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,no,,"BKK-MNL-TCL-MNL-BKK in December January and April. While the international flights were largely on time (usually delays of about 30 mins) PR does have a horrible on time record on domestic routes. The TCL-MNL flight in December and April was delayed by 3 hours I was lucky to made the BKK connection (rushed in minibus over the tarmac from T3 to T2). On all three trips the MNL-TCL flights were delayed by 1 hour. The excuse is always ""late arrival of aircraft"" which they claim is beyond their control! Food on the international flights is inedible I rate it the worst airline food I have come across. On my last MNL-BKK flight it was freezing cold - passengers complaining. However they only had 20 blankets for 100+ passengers. I guess I need to look for alternatives."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,3.0,no,,Never again! We flew Bangkok to Manila. Manila to Cebu and are flying tomorrow Manila to Bangkok. All 3 flights have had the times changed and quite considerably. This is not normally an issue but we have connecting flights. The worst being our flight tomorrow from Manila to Bangkok. It was originally at 14.15 arriving at 16.45 perfect for our connecting flight at 20.45 so we have time to clear immigration and re-check in. Then it was changed to 15.40 arriving in Bangkok at 18.10 which is just about OK for our 20.45 flight bearing in mind we must clear immigration as it's a different unlinked airline booking. Then today the day before I go online to check in (a good job I have) and our flight has been changed to 17.50 arriving in Bangkok at 20.20 which is impossible for our connecting flight. The best PAL have offered is a 'free' change to the 09.35 flight arriving in Bangkok at 12.05. We now lose half a day in Manila and we had planned to do our souvenir shopping then and we now have 8.5 hours at BKK airport. Yes we could go into BKK but we've visited BKK many many times before (we only live in Laos an hour away). I am not impressed. How can an airline change all 3 flights we've booked?
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,4.0,no,5,I came back from Manila on March 31 2014 on flight to LAX. As I boarded in NAIA on March 31 2014 the first attendant did not make any courteous comments whatsoever. Her response was rude but I tolerated it because I chose to fly cheap. PAL's Business Class is around $4.000 cheaper than Cathay Pacific and PAL flies direct. Service was not bad and all facilities were working. On our previous LAX-MNL flight the reading light above me wouldn't switch off and like other reviewers have said nothing was done about it. On this leg we paid the $50 for extra leg room in economy and ended up behind the main door with the big hump thereby preventing me from extending my leg forward. We can fly CP or JAL or SA and pay a lot more plus spend more time in the air and on layovers or we can just pay PAL their cheap fares and hope that the next PAL plane we board is newer.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5.0,yes,10,LHR-MNL-LHR. I had to fly to MNL for an emergency. I couldn't get any flight on the usual airlines I fly with specifically Star Alliance member airlines or Emirates. A PAL flight suited my schedule so I booked a flight with them. I was not sure of PAL when I did the booking as it is fairly new to the London market though it is the only airline that offers a direct flight to between LHR and MNL. The day of the flight came. I did a web check in with no frills. When I got to the airport (LHR T4) the longest queue of passengers waiting to check in got my attention: all PAL passengers on the same flight I was about to be in. Luckily I checked in online so I did not have to wait for hours. PAL does not have its own ground staff hence was outsourced with DNATA which Emirates owns. When I got onboard very friendly FAs assisted me and changed my mood. Service really is great may be the same as Singapore Airlines' service. Food is average had 3 services all throughout the flight. Inflight entertainment is good though as not extensive as Emirates' ICE. No complimentary toiletries in flight unlike Asiana. Seats are wider and comfortable unlike seats on Singapore Air's A380s. On my way back to London I am impressed with the service at Centennial Terminal that PAL exclusively uses compared to Terminal 1 which is stressful. The flight was the longest flight i have ever been into - 15 hours. The service was great. In total PAL LHR flight is good value for money and will fly again with them. Hopefully PAL will have its own ground staff at LHR as DNATA staff do not care and gives bad impression on PAL.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,,3/8/14 we were denied to board our flight from Basco to Manila due to the strong winds. 10 passengers were bumped off including us. Reason given was they needed to reduce the weight of the plane. No assistance were given to find accommodation or a flight out. Told to go to the PAL office in the town and speak to a PAL agent there. The agent offered us a ticket on a flight 2 days later even though they had a flight next day. We were forced to buy tickets from another airline to be able to fly out next day.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,2.0,no,1,We fly PAL regularly from San Francisco London and Tokyo to Bacolod. In January after a meeting in Manila we were to take the 12.30pm flight to Bacolod - which PAL was charging a premium for. Six hours later we arrived in Bacolod at 7.45pm. No offers of a meal premium ticket refund or any customer assistance. We are trying to find alternative airlines to fly. It should be noted however that inflight service has always been good.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,2.0,no,1,I fly LAX-HKG twice a year and am still wondering why my company got tickets with PAL. Starts off 12hr delay at LAX. Every 2 hours they would bump it two more. I live about 30 minutes from the airport and would have gone home if I had known it was going to be 12hrs. Then to add salt to the wound when I landed in HKG and they had lost my luggage. At least they got my luggage to me in Shenzhen about 40 hours later so I feel fortunate. Food and crew were very nice and no complaints there.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,,Flew from Singapore to Manila. Last group to get on locker space over my seat was full with other passengers excess baggage they had to find a space half way down the plane! Airline should only let 1 carry on the rest should be checked in. Staff didn't care. Flying out to CDO plane was 1.5 hours late taking off same problem again my locker space crammed with other passengers baggage had to put my bag under my seat.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,3.0,yes,8,I went on it last summer 2013 with my family from Hong Kong to Manila on an A320. Cabin was clean cabin crew were friendly comfortable seat but poor entertainment system. The food was good and no delays were required. I recommend this for tourists to the Philippines for holidays. It's much better than Cebu Pacific.
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1.0,no,,Here we sit in Manila airport waiting for our 2.35 in the afternoon flight to Puerto Princessa. It is now 5.45 pm. No compensation offered no excuses offered they do not care they are extremely disorganized we will never use this airline again. The staff working at the customer service desks had no idea what was going on as well as being too busy on their phones to even look up and address us.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,,4.0,yes,7,MNL - Puerto Princesa - MNL flight using a PAL Express A320. Crew was courteous. Pilots and crew spoke fluent English. Complimentary snacks. No flight entertainment as this was a domestic flight. Both flights to and from were on time.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,,Paid for 20 domestic flights for a big family travelling within the Philippines and had at least 2 flights delayed by at least 2 hours (9 tickets affected) without any offer of stay i.e lounge access. Requested Lounge access as my flight delay would mean 7 hours out of hotel accommodation and 4 hours in airport but was told Lounge is for first and business class. No manager on customer service would talk to me as were too busy. Embarrassing as they are the national carrier.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,4.0,yes,7,Travelled Sydney-Manila return in business class. I was pleasantly surprised - the flight was very comfortable with excellent service comfortable lie-flat seats and was pretty much on time. The only real issue was the poor entertainment system best bring a good book.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,2.0,no,,"I flew to Manila Philippines with PAL last July 2013 and it was the worst airline experience I have had. The crew were not willing to help passengers. Inflight service was slow and did not even offer drinking water during the flight. I asked for one and the flight attendant said ""in a while"" and never came back. I will not fly this airline again."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4.0,yes,8,MNL-HKG. Chaotic and long waits at Terminal 2. Very friendly check-in. Paying the terminal fee (not knowing why) is not possible to pay with credit card like in Terminal 1 and 3. Flight was delayed for nearly 2 hours. Staff onboard were very friendly few films only (compared to EK or TK) but very delicious food. Seats were ok! In HKG the luggage took a very long time to arrive. I will fly again with PR.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,,,4.0,yes,7,PR731 BKK-MNL Feb 27th. Online booking smooth as was online check-in. At BKK priority Immigration and lounge pass given direct down to THAI Business Lounge D. Far better lounge than the SATS that PAL uses at Changi. Onboard seated beverage requests taken asked for Champagne. 5 min later told they have ran out of Champagne. I ask how is this possible when we are still firmly at the gate. Purser explains PAL is not allowed to restock anywhere other than at home base in Manila. Since Feb 1st they are allowed to load only 2 bottles for Business class for 2 sectors. This A340 had 24 Business class seats 13pax. Outbound had 19 pax and all Champagne was consumed. Purser visibly frustrated by this policy but powerless. Same policy applies even to long-haul flights. Equally Economy is now limited to 120 cans of beer. Running out of Premium Class service items even before departure is ridiculous. This is regrettable because food was good and portions adequate and PAL Cabins Staff in Business is very friendly courteous and attentive. Seating was also comfortable as this was their long-haul A340 (Crew rest area in front Galley). Departure was delayed by about 20min arrival almost on time. Will fly again 2 weeks from now but if the same repeats itself I'm done with PAL.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,,,4.0,yes,7,MNL-BKK-MNL. Flew last summer on an A340. interior are old entertainment is poor (drop down tv monitor only) boarding is delayed by 15 min only (no problem) take off is again delayed by 10 min (not fault of the airline). Flight crew robotic (not consistent with their domestic crew). Return flight is same crew are robotic and not warm but they are professional. PR lags behind other Asian competitor. Will fly them again maybe after rehabilitation is finished.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,1,Brisbane-Darwin-Manila return Mabuhay (Business Class) on Airbus A320. This is a very poor business class product. Seat was an old style recliner seat with a pitch comparable to economy class of other carriers. Seat reclines for about 2 inches and does not have any leg rest making it the most uncomfortable during a 7.5-hour journey. Entertainment is very poor no noise cancellation headphones and no amenity kits were given despite being advertised in the website. Service was attentive but food was very standard. Overall it was a very disappointing experience flying the Mabuhay Class product on this route. Unless they will upgrade their equipment the product is not worth the price.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,,,1.0,no,,I flew Bangkok to Manila once a month for business for almost one year unfortunately I don't recall having one single flight on time. The average delay on this route is about 1-2 hours. Whether morning flight or late flight you face the same issue missing your connection no compensation nor accommodation arrangements. I am a gold frequent flyer on Air France China Eastern and Thai Airways from now on I am going to stay away from this airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,,4.0,yes,10,Flight from Cagayan de Oro to Manila plane was clean staff always friendly to the passenger. PAL is really a much better airline than the years before. Snacks coffee and water were offered. All in all a nice flight again with PAL.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,yes,10,YQT-YYZ-MNL-YYZ-YQT in May-June 2013. I had flown through HKG and NRT to get to the Philippines in previous trips. So much easier to make one connection in YYZ rather than having to make 2 connections. Staff were good plane was very good. I paid the $20 for premium economy. Was a newer Boeing 777-300ER with a fair bit of room. (Pro tip: Sit on one of the sides not the middle section.) The warm cloths towards the end of the trip are a nice touch as I usually only get those when I fly in Business Class. Only complaint was not enforcing carry-on restrictions which can get out of hand. Ample baggage allowances. Terminal 2 is better than Terminal 1 but not as good as Terminal 3 IMHO but it's good enough and certainly not the fault of the airline. Immigration and Baggage was probably about an hour but again not the fault of the airline. Flight is overnight which means you arrive early the next day and can start your business or whatever immediately. I have another trip booked on the same route this May 2014 so yes I will be flying again.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,yes,10,YVR-Manila Dec 2013 return in Business class. As always the service was exemplary and we were made to feel welcome by the 2 crew members assigned to us. This was our third time in Business Class with PAL. The food was faultless. I do not know why people complain about their lie flat beds they are comfortable. The new business class lounge in Manila is a huge improvement and is very welcoming airside. The cabin on the 777 was spotless though there was an issue with my pillow not being clean as we boarded in Vancouver but this was changed. The purser approached me to apologise.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4.0,yes,7,I flew business class round trip from LAX to MNL in January/February 2014. The 747 and A340 were older models. The service was excellent and made up for the older generation aircraft. The pilots were also very good with smooth landings. There was moderate turbulence on the way back to LA but the pilots handled it very well.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,2.0,yes,5,I have been flying MEL-MNL-MEL and SYD-MNL-SYD for the last 6 months. Initially PAL we're using 777 for both of these routes. Planes were brand new with lie flat beds in business. Since about September PAL have been using older 330/340 planes. Business seats are old and just a little better than economy. Business upgrades have been a waste of money on these. Service though has remained top class throughout the period.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,,,3.0,no,1,Hong Kong to Manila PR 301 27 Jan 2014. A320 cabin was very confined and there was a long queue for toilets - was nowhere near as pleasant as previous flights taken in their A330. I will make a conscious effort to book PAL flights on their larger aircraft in future.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,,,4.0,no,5,My husband and I traveled recently from LAX to Manila and back. We are vegans and had called Philippine Airlines twice to confirm our meal requests. On the trip from LAX to Manila we were served excellent vegan meals and the cabin staff were excellent. We had a problem on the return trip. We arrived to Manila airport 3 hours before our flight after traveling 2 hours from our resort. The business class lounge had no vegan or vegetarian food. We walked all the airport food concessions. Not one had any vegetarian food. Then we boarded our flight. The business class stewardess asked us for meal choices and when we said we had requested vegan meals she looked surprised. The Catering manager and his assistant came on board to speak to us to tell us to take the next day flight and the airline would have a meal for us. The only thing I can say is the business class stewardess was excellent. She did her best to find nuts fruits and remove meat and cheese from salads.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,yes,8,YYZ-MNL-BKK on Jan 10 2014. 777 plane fairly new and very clean. Stop in YVR for more passengers and crew change. Then 13.5 hours to Manila. I thought overall the food selection was very good. Nicely presented and well garnished. Seats were comfortable with almost full flat. Was able to sleep and I am a fairly large man. Although the on demand entertainment system worked well I found the selection a little small and the movies somewhat aged The 3.5 hour flight from MNL-BKK was on an A340 that was showing some age. After take off we found the entertainment system did not work. Seems it was ok in economy but Business was not. The FA returned shortly with a stack of I Pads and gave them out. They had music games and movies. Really nice touch. The lounges in both YYZ and MNL were nice with food and WIFI.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,1.0,no,,I booked 2 domestic return flights Manila-Caticlan/Boracay-Manila and Manila-Busuanga/Coron-Manila. The first one that was also their first flight to Caticlan in the early morning was incredibly delayed whereas their bigger competitor was continuing to announce boarding and boarding to Caticlan/Boracay and to various other domestic destinations. My second flight (from Caticlan to Manila on 2nd January 2014 morning) was also delayed but not too big a delay. My third flight from Manila to Busanga on 2nd January 2014 (afternoon) was cancelled. My fourth flight from Busuanga to Manila on 6th January 2014 (afternoon) was cancelled as the third one. Canceling the above mentioned flights meant one extra night in Manila and one extra night in Coron Town (both paid by Philippine Airlines including return transfers and very small meals both for Dinner and Breakfast). Based on what I experienced directly i.e. my same (afternoon) flight from MNL to Busuanga was canceled also on 1st January 2014 on 6th January both flights from Busuanga to Manila were canceled it seems that at least during the first week of 2014 the route Manila/Busuanga-Manila was operated by Philippine Airlines/PAL express on a Best Effort way so beware! Based on my personal experience if you plan to fly to Busuanga then Cebu Pacific looks like a much more reliable option.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,,,0.0,no,4,Melbourne to Manila. Aircraft was an old A330 (scheduled to be an old A340 - normally a 777 though). Lounge in MEL is the Air NZ Koru Club lounge - one of the better lounges in Melbourne. Initially delayed for 2 hours due to late arrival of inbound a/c then further delayed by 1/2 hr due to technical problem. Bussed out to plane. Inflight seats are old. Do not recline much - no lie flat beds here. Luckily its a day flight. Service was quite good. Meal was average. Luggage arrived as expected. 4/10 overall.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,,,4.0,yes,8,Business Class from Manila to Tokyo and the only issue I had was their inflight meal portion size. There were two options of either Chicken or Fish I decided to have the fish and the portion size was ridiculous for a business class meal. I am no way a big eater but for a business class flight this should be looked at. The 2 pieces of fish were smaller than a matchbox with only 2 string beans and 2 roast potato balls. I have flown with Singapore Airlines and their business class meal portion size is worthwhile. The solution was - I had mentioned this to the inflight crew and they had offered me another meal which was nice of them to do so and they said they would report this to the catering department. Bottom Line: The overall service for PHP Airlines business class is good and staff are friendly. I enjoyed the experience and would fly with them again but I strongly suggest that the portion size for the business class meals are looked at and adjusted to a suitable size that's worth the fare paid. The overall experience was very good and the service was above average.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,yes,9,I have flown three times for LAX-MNL-CEB-MNL-LAX. Each time has been a good experience. Food was good attendants very friendly and service is excellent. Called by my name. Always use PR103 if you are leaving LAX the other one I think it's PR113 is an A340 without the lie-flats. The 747-400 has the lie-flats.
,,,Premium Economy,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,1,BKK-Manila-SFO. There is no web check-in. We waited in line for 2 hours in BKK to check in and check bags. We spoke with airline after booking and prepaid for preferred economy seat (bulkhead 31 A and C) when I checked the flight status before leaving for the airport it would not let me check in but it did show our correct seat assignments. After the 2 hour check in process the check in woman handed us boarding passes with different seats. Told that we needed to go upstairs to their airline office and find out about the payment status. We had less than 45 minutes to clear immigration and security before boarding so we ran up. They then informed us that Philippine airlines does not take credit cards over the phone so we could not have prepaid we had to run down to a money exchange to exchange Thai Baht and then go back to the check in counter. I have never encountered a more disorganized and unfriendly airline. We arrived into Manila and it only got worse. We were ushered into a dirty holding area after presenting our boarding passes at the transit desk and then us and a small group of people traveling to SFO were walked into our terminal where our next flight would depart in 4 hours. We then realized that we were completely trapped for 4 hours between 6-10.30pm in a terminal with no food other than a disgusting hot dog stand that only accepted Philippine quezos. It was awful and so dirty. I was told that a request for a vegetarian meal on the flight could only be done in person 4 hours prior to the flight. As soon as I realized the situation I walked up to make my request. They then told me that could only be done 72 hours before! But it cannot be done online because nothing can with this airline. The plane had very narrow seats and was an old 747. I asked the flight attendant about the meal situation. She said she would check and left me with an empty tray with a roll and cup and never returned with anything or an explanation. The only positive was that the pilot did keep us updated with clear communication in English and allowed us to arrive safely as he navigated through some bad turbulence.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,4.0,yes,10,MEL-MNL. Check-in was fast as I skipped the main line. Very close to full flight. Departed about 25 minutes late and arrived 20 minutes late Catering in business class extensive and of good quality with the salads particularly enjoyable. It was also great to have cheese and biscuits as part of the offering. In flight entertainment is only available in business class and was only passable. Immigration quick; luggage took another 15 minutes to arrive.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,3.0,yes,8,I have been flying PAL for the last 26 years. Still the best local carrier there is and for the past year or so they certainly upped their game with new route and equipment used. I mostly fly with them domestically and never had a problem in check in so far no delays and meals satisfactory for short and mid haul flights probably better the most. T2 is fine. it is well priced and a value for money compared to other airlines especially on mid haul and long. Plus who can beat the baggage allowance. Hopefully they change their A340 and older A330 quickly or have them retrofitted with new products and a better hospitality training on some FA's on long haul especially the older one's or replaced them. Other than that will fly them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,yes,9,YVR-MNL MNL-BKK. Excellent service and seat-back entertainment systems. The food was very good and was served often throughout the flight. Transfers were handled quickly in the airport and all connecting flights were made without issue. Seats aren't amazing but are on par with other airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,2.0,yes,2,"My partner and I traveled from Melbourne Australia last September this was my partner's first trip to Manila. He was appalled at the service onboard. Once the meals were being served he asked if he could have a scotch on the rocks to which the stewardess said very quietly to ""have a look "" in the kitchen? She came back with a half- empty bottle and her face expression was like ""don't tell anyone that we are serving wine beer or any kind of alcohol"". Food was alright and not too heavy on the stomach."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,4.0,yes,9,I flew from Vancouver to MNL October 5 at 1.40am. This was my first time flying PALs B777. It was a brand new plane compared to their past planes which were A340 or A330. Service was excellent with a very smooth landing.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5.0,yes,7,Flew via their new A321 on a morning flight. The service was excellent which made up for the loss of on-board entertainment. There were not headsets nor movies to watch the entire flight! I hope they solve this as soon as possible.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,,2.0,no,,If you have a choice avoid Economy class in all new Philippine Airlines planes whether Airbus A330-300 or Boeing 777-300ER. Philippine Airlines has installed very narrow 3-3-3 seating in Economy on it's A330-300's (originally designed by Airbus for 2-4-2) and 3-4-3 on it's 777-300ERs (originally designed by Boeing for 3-3-3). The result for passengers is a horrible narrow shoulder-to-shoulder seat making a very claustrophobic and degrading experience for anyone of normal adult size. Since its acquisition by Philippines' San Miguel group Philippine Airlines has turned into a petty-minded low-cost cargo plane for people.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5.0,yes,9,MNL-SYD-MNL. My wife and I left Manila via terminal 2 on 1st November 2013 check in was great no holdups. The Mabuhay Lounge is quite good food adequate and freshly replaced frequently. The flight itself on a 777ER was a night flight and uneventful except the leg rest only came up halfway. The service was very good and the food choices also very good. The return flight was on the 16th November. Check in again very easy. The flight itself was a day flight on a A440 the plane itself although a bit old was ok. The seats were larger than economy but still comfortable but again the footrest would not come up resulting in swollen feet again. However the service was absolutely first class as was the food so this made it worthwhile. PAL have certainly lifted their game over the last few years and I would rank them as equal to any other Asian Airline. Definitely not a 3 star airline but at least a 4 star airline. We are going to Bangkok in December so I will compare that trip to this.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,,,4.0,yes,8,"MNL-SIN on new A321. Seat would have been very comfortable if a footrest was provided. As it is your legs just dangle over the edge of the chair with no support. USB power supply provided but no outlet for a laptop. No TVs - not even over head ones or any other inflight entertainment. Crew helpful and attentive toilet kept clean. Dinner was excellent better than I've had on some 5 star airlines. Nice lounge at Manila airport. ""B"" grade business class but priced accordingly. Will use again if the price is right."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4.0,yes,8,CGK-MNL-CGK flight to MNL departed late due to late arrival from Manila. A319 is used on this route and timing of the flight is a bit inconvenient as you left Jakarta at 1AM and arrived in Manila at 6AM. Aircraft is clean and well maintained no PTV but overhead screen is available. Returning from Manila in a more convenient morning flight arriving in Jakarta at 1PM. Inflight service on both flights are good meal served is adequate with plenty of drink service. Cabin staff friendly and willing to help. . Only drawback is their entertainment inflight as the flight lasted around 4 hours and it would be better to have PTV in each seat rather than overhead screen.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,yes,7,October 13 YVR to MNL Business class on a 777-300. Very comfortable seating great service and reasonably good food (only ate breakfast). These seats are almost flat bed seats with a minor recline when fully extended. I was able to sleep for 7 hours on my side without slipping to the floor - pretty good.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,3.0,yes,7,Oct 10th Vancouver to Manila flight PR 117 A340. Oct 12th Manila to General Santos flight PR 454V A320. Their website needs a makeover as it has too many pages with jumbled information one needs to search out web check in instead of having it on the front page. It needs to add an APP to make it easier for the busy traveller to use his smart phone to check in not just to use it as a boarding ticket. The staff also needs to understand web check in as the three terminals I used (Vancouver Manila and General Santos) had web check in lines but were not used. In Vancouver I lined up in the web check in line only to be told to go to the long regular line. The A340 long haul aircraft needs to be outfitted with an entertainment system for every seat like most world class airlines. Their recently acquired 777's have it which makes the long flights over the pacific more tolerable. Staff are exemplary always showing the level of service which put North American carriers to shame. Overall I would give them 3 stars out of 5 easily able to go higher with a few touch ups in their online system and aircraft entertainment systems.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5.0,yes,9,Flew SIN-MNL-SIN. SIN-MNL flight was a 777. New plane great service but I think the movies in the inflight entertainment were the same as last May's. The MNL-SIN flight was wan old plane that with an overhead TV screen.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,,,5.0,yes,9,I was rescheduled to an earlier flight which is PR880. I was surprised to experienced their new A321. Flight PR880 was on time departing 7.45pm from Cebu to Manila. The flight attendants are all up beat and friendly. The inflight snacks was a biscuit and peanuts only. The seat in economy was fine for a short trip. The seat reclines a little and the seat slides forward. What I liked is the attentiveness of the cabin crews. After 50 minutes in the air we landed smoothly and on-time.
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,yes,8,KTM to BKK. It is good and like others mentioned here the plane was quite old and there's no inflight entertainment. The website must be upgraded as there is no way to book online. However its worth travelling.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,3.0,yes,7,MNL-BKK-MNL in business class. The business class lounge at the international PAL terminal has been totally refurbished compared to the one I saw in November 2012. Its modern clean comfortable the food and drinks selection is good. En route to Bangkok by coincidence we have been embarked into an A321 maiden flight. Being a 3.5 hrs trip and a day flight comfort is not as important as for the long haul ones. However the seating was narrow without any leg rest no power sockets and no inflight entertainment which is awkward for a brand new plane of latest generation. After we took off we have been given iPads which did the job with a wide selection of movies and inflight electronic entertainment. On the way back I have been boarded into an A340 former Iberia but the experience in this case was excellent compared to the outbound route. Lie flatbed powered seats inflight entertainment (although the selection was limited to just one movie) and good service onboard. Must throw a huge commend for the attendants fantastic attentive professional all of them. Concluding for mid-short flight the experience its ok. Considering that the airline came out from tough times in the recent past it is fair to say that they did a good recovery job but from a passenger point of view there is certainly room for improvement except for the cabin crew which clearly stand out compared to most other competitors even if big names.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,,Our plane was downgraded from a 747 to a A340. That is the most ridiculous thing I have heard of when travelling on a long-haul international flight. Why on earth would Philippine Airlines downgrade a plane that is travelling from Manila to SFO knowing that there are hundreds of passengers on this long-haul flight? The supposed reason from the supervisor was that the 747 was under maintenance and there wasn't a back-up plane for them to use. That is ridiculous that Philippine Airlines doesn't have a back-up 747 for a long-haul flight. Because of this we spent 2 hours waiting at the check-in counter until 3 seats became available for my party (and this was accomplished by compensating passengers willing to give up their seat). Once we were on our flight the flight attendants did not clean the bathrooms at all. When you have 260+ passengers on a plane using 6 bathrooms they need to get cleaned regularly. Additionally this downgraded plane did not provide personal entertainment systems. Having personal entertainment systems should be a requirement for a long haul international flight. The only good thing about this experience was how patient the check-in associate was with us and the fact that she was able to get 3 seats open for us.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,3.0,no,,MLA to DGTE in June. Flight ended up being cancelled after 7 hours of waiting due to various unrecognizable reasons. We were already taxiing to the runway when the pilot decided to cancel the flight. Came back this month (September) and bought again a return ticket for MLA-DGTE-MLA. The outgoing flight went well although with the usual delay (2 hours) but on my return I decided to get an earlier flight from another airline because a day before the return trip I have been monitoring the airline's reliability and they were way off their declared schedules. Fearing I'd miss my international flight later that night I took the noon flight on another airline placing my afternoon flight with Air Philippines as backup. The other airline got me on time for my international flight and a phone call from my sister confirmed that I wouldn't have made it had I took Air Philippines as they arrived and left DGTE late again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,yes,10,SFO-MNL-DVO-MNL-SFO. I couldn't have asked for more. Each flight I was on was excellent though I guess it all depends on what you expect. I expect to get to where I'm going as safely as possible in an aircraft that's worthy and has been cleaned and with pilots and crew that know what they're doing. Oh if there's some food and drinks fantastic. I'd fly with PAL again in a minute! Excellent!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,,,5.0,yes,9,SIN-MLA one-way Economy class on A330. The cabin looks tired. Seats are ok. Food was tasty. The flight attendants are polite but they lack the smile and hospitality that I'm used to when flying PAL. Overall experience still good. Price is cheaper as compared to other full-serviced airlines in the region. Definitely will fly again on this airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,yes,8,Flew B777-300er to Canada. Delayed 1 hour due to some technical problems and miscommunications between ground staff. The cabin was pleasantly relaxing generous legroom with inflight entertainment monitors each seat offering lots of good movies games and music. Food was tasty it satisfied my palate crew were very friendly professional immaculately neat and well groomed. Philippine Airlines is improving now becoming more competitive I would say. Will definitely fly with them again In the future.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5.0,yes,10,DVO-MNL-NGO the service was good and the meals are based on Japanese taste. The seats though not first class were comfortable leg room was sufficient. The cabin crew were very friendly and hospitality to each passenger. I will choose to fly PAL again.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5.0,yes,9,Manila-Melbourne 21.00 hrs on their new fleet Airbus A340 and was very impressed. As you would expect modern seating everything worked lots of space and great value for money.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,3.0,yes,3,July 2013 we flew CGK-MNL-CGK. Used credit card to purchase tickets online through official PAL website when we checked-in we were not asked to show the credit card used to purchase ticket. During the flight hot meal was a choice of chicken or beef (CGK-MNL). Also a piece of bread on the tray but no butter. No wet towels provided. Also flew MNL-LAO-MNL and MNL-CEB-MNL on PAL not one departed on time (weather good no typhoon). Bought domestic tickets online (separately) didn't notice that baggage allowance could be different for the trip to LAO and CEB (10 kg & 20 kg respectively). Found out later that baggage allowance for domestic flights depends on the price you pay for the ticket but no such information before you click purchase. Since PAL is a full-service airline I think baggage allowance should be 20kg for economy class at whatever price you pay.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,yes,7,LAX-MNL-LAX June - July 2013. Outbound flight delayed due to late arrival of aircraft went non-stop to Manila seat was good - had the bulkhead seat row 45. Leg room adequate flight attendants very nice food was adequate - served snack in between meals. On return left the gate on time but had to return to the gate due to some mechanical problem causing a delay of 2 hrs. Seat was better this time had another bulkhead seat row 32 HJK. 32 H was excellent with nothing in front of you flight attendants were the same very nice food. AVOD did not work in my seat but was given IPAD by flight attendant which has similar movies and music.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,,,5.0,yes,9,Flew via PAL Express flight in NAIA T3. (2P-971 MNL-TAC) last June aboard their newest A320 in their fleet (RP- C8399). Courteous and friendly Flight Attendants.. having free biscuits nuts and coffee/water served on board (even they classified as LCC). Interior smells like brand new car. Even my co-passengers upon arrival told that the service of PR/PAL Express is nice.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,2.0,no,3,Booked from Abu Dhabi to Manila via Bahrain on Etihad and Philippine Airlines (code share flight with Gulf Air). Etihad was great but Philippine Airlines (Gulf Air) was terrible as I could not chose an Aisle seat and also could not do online check-in. I am a bit taller and I always choose an Aisle seat for comfort imagine travelling 10 hours in a middle seat - cramped! Terrible experience. I have to travel again on 5th August 2013 and still no one from the airline is ready to help.
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,yes,8,BKK-KTM economy. B-757 though ageing the aircraft was nice and clean. Good language skills with very friendly cabin staff. Captain provided plenty of information. Food was served hot and delicious. I would certainly recommend Nepal Airlines on that price.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,2.0,no,2,HKG-MNL-LAX (JUL 12 2013). Flight from MNL to LAX was delayed 4 hours. Old and worn out plane for both flights. No personal entertainment screen which is terrible considering it's a 13 hour flight. Food is OK but the portions are way too small. The only thing that could have redeemed this airline was if their cabin crews are friendly and hospitable enough - but they aren't. There were Malaysian passengers who were requesting the vegetarian meal but they did not request it online / before the flight. Ideally an airline should be prepared for such situations. It was very disappointing how the cabin crew handled such thing. Makes me wonder what kind of training they undergo. They should learn a lot from Singapore airlines crew. PAL crews will serve food then disappear and reappear again when the next meal is to be served. Again learn from Singapore airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,,,4.0,no,5,Flight from Manila to Korea with Airbus A340 was good enough! The plane does not have the Video Entertainment to watch! Not recommended to fly again! They're still using the old plane.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,3.0,no,5,Flew return LAX-MNL-LAX in April 2013. Outbound delayed 2 hrs due computer problems. Boarded 747 aircraft. Looked very old and worn. Only movie screen was on bulkhead. No seatback video. Food was small portions for 17 hr flight with stop in GUM for fuel. Flt Attnd's very friendly. Some value for ticket but not enough to make me want to fly PAL again. Return trip to LAX was A340. Again very worn and not new by any standard. No video or entertainment of any kind - was broken. After meal service apx 2 hrs after take off flt attnds disappeared and occasionally would see one walking from front to back quickly. Poor service old worn out aircraft and no in flight entertainment of any kind. Would not fly PAL again for any reason. They are the bottom of the list for comfort convenience or customer service.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,,5.0,yes,10,I flew round trip from San Francisco to Manila in Mabuhay (business) class in January 2013. There is no first class on the planes. The Mabuhay Lounge at SFO offered a superb light dinner. Business class was only half full. I had no one sitting next to me. Flight attendants addressed me formally by name and went out of their way to provide my requested food and beverages. Although the seat did not fully recline the seat plus the superb leg rest gave me enough room to curl up and sleep well. On the return which I had to make ahead of my schedule for personal reasons there was only one Mabuhay class seat available on the main deck of the 747 and the check-in agent obtained permission from the supervisor to assign it to me. The food in the Manila Mabuhay Lounge was superb-enough variety for a delicious complete dinner. My seat was in the first row of the plane which meant that I could place my carry-on in a closet in front of my seat rather than in an inconvenient overhead bin. I had the aisle seat but the person in the window seat had enough room to walk around the front of my seat and I was not disturbed during my sleep. Once again I was addressed by the crew by my title and surname and the food and beverage selection and service were superb. The outbound flight was two hours early as the light load enabled it to skip refuelling in Guam. The return flight was on time.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,yes,7,"Vancouver to Manila flight. A 777 airplane. Landed at Manila International Airport Terminal 2. Positives: Very friendly staff Prompt service of meals and snacks Some extras - toothbrush toothpaste morning face towel Fun amusing safety video Clean Individual video screens. Touch screen. Negatives: Middle of the night snacking - they turn the lights on thereby ""forcing"" everyone to wake up to eat the snack. In flight entertainment of movies does allow you to select the latest movies among the rest of the movie selections. During the duty free shopping time FAs were very noisy and in our section there were 6-7 of them. They were passing items over the heads of passengers. It was very noisy and invasive of passenger space and peace. Tons of babies on the flight. Very noisy. When passengers were seated you still have lots of seat transfers because they have this policy of charging people $50 or $20 if you wanted to move to economy plus or to an exit row. Instead of having some peace of mind you have loud speaking passengers asking questions then moving their hand baggage to their new seats."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,4.0,yes,5,HKG - Manila return. Flight out was 3.5 hours delayed and not even the merest hint of an apology on board. We were provided with a 75 HK$ meal voucher at check-in. On board the seat pitch is very good and the crew were courteous and professional. Planes are quite dated but fine. The return flight was only 20 minutes late and the meal was delicious. It was one of the tastiest meals I've had on about 300 flights over the last 15 years. I just wish PAL could be more reliable in terms of scheduling as hanging around the airport for 3.5 hours late at night is not fun at all.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,2.0,no,4,PR512 SIN-MNL. After a rather lacklustre MNL-SIN leg (an early morning flight marred by dismal FA service and attitude) I was optimistic that the outbound leg was merely a fluke. Check in at Changi and the ground staff messed up seat assignments (I traveled with 3 children and we were separated on the flight - good thing we were able to switch with a friendly lady so we can sit together). Flight delayed an hour out of Singapore and FA attitude was exactly the same as our outbound flight. Service was hurried cold and distant. Food was inedible. Good thing we had dinner at Changi before the flight. I really wish PAL would pay more attention to the people skills of their staff.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,2.0,no,2,Booked 2 tickets leaving June 30 and coming back July 5 PR 119 and PR118. Staff seemed very tired I pressed the button for stewardess attention she passed by me several times until I physically had to touch her and tell her I needed a glass of water. The food quality falls below the standard for international airlines there were no snacks served in between meals. Flight duration between Toronto to Vancouver was 4 hours and from Vancouver to Manila 12 hrs. At check in we were asked to pay $20 per person to get a better economy seat even though we paid $4200 for the ticket. The only advantage was that you don't need to change planes between Toronto to Manila.
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,no,,"Our family of 5 went to Boracay for vacation last week (starting May 16). Manila-Kalibo on May 16 Kalibo-Manila on May 19 5.15pm. Trip going to Kalibo was ok however I was shocked to receive an email advisory from PAL on Saturday night at 6.35pm that we have been re-booked from our May 20 5.15pm flight to May 20 6.30am instead! It is impossible to get from Boracay island to Kalibo by that hour. CS agent and supervisor were insisting we either take the 6.30am May 20 flight or do a ""go-show"" for their 8pm or 10pm or 12.15am flights. I had to stay on the line with their CS Supervisor until he finally got us confirmed seats on May 20 4.15pm flight. In all of this all PAL could say was ""sorry for the inconvenience"". I will avoid this airline from now on."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,,,3.0,no,5,Flew PR 511 MNL-SIN on 19 May 2013 in coach. PAL doesn't have online check in for international flights. Fortunately flight was fairly empty and an early morning flight and check in meant that the airport was not as crowded as usual. Painless going through check in with a full compliment of baggage from the family (wife and 3 kids). Immigration and security was a breeze. Because of the few number of passengers on this 6am flight boarding was easy. In fact the plane was fully loaded a good 20 mins before scheduled push back from the terminal. The good part of the flight ended there. I knew beforehand that there was no personal entertainment on PAL's A330 so I loaded the kids' gadgets with entertainment to keep them occupied for the 3 plus hour flight (an eternity in kids' clocks). What ruined the flight for me was the FAs attitudes of just going through the motions of completing the cabin service. It was rushed and no effort was made to accommodate passengers' requests. My wife's aisle cart ran out of the beef option but mine was stocked with it. When she requested for the beef she was merely told they ran out. I had to point out to the FA in her aisle to get the selection from the other cart. The food was pretty tasty for airline food though. Twice requested for coffee and it never came. No after meal drink run and the FAs were just in the galley chatting away. I recall the time when the saving grace of Philippine Airlines was the friendly and efficient service of the staff. Now they seem to even be losing that. I never thought I'd live long enough to see the day when I had better service from American FAs (was on Delta a few months ago) than from Philippine Airlines' FAs.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4.0,yes,9,Have flown PAL twice now from Melbourne to Manila first time was so so plane was late taking off but on board service was fine. Flew again in April and was pleasantly surprised by the improvement in the airline flight on time cabin crew were very friendly and welcoming. Am a bit disappointed they are cutting out the direct Melbourne to Manila flight. All in all no complaints though their terminal is a bit small and stuffy.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4.0,yes,10,Recently flew from Toronto to Manila Flit# 119 and returned Flit# 118 with Philippine Airlines. The crew onboard the flight were very professional courteous and made sure everyone was comfortable through the entire journey. The seats though not first class were comfortable leg room was sufficient food was good no complaints here. If I am ever to return to the Philippines for another vacation I will once again choose PAL.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,3.0,no,6,Had a fairly pleasant flight but the plane (A330 Singapore to Manila in economy) was very old and rickety. A small number of common TVs down the centreline that skipped and lost sound constantly. Old seats aggressive aircon and everything just didn't seem very well put together. Good food and staff though.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5.0,yes,9,New B777-300ER from Manila to Toronto. They were excellent and for the price their product is hard beat. Staff were excellent and service was outstanding. The wine selection leaves something to be desired but their food was creative although portions were small. The aircraft was clean and seats were comfortable. They are not fully horizontal but for me they were comfortable.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4.0,yes,5,Hong Kong - Manila return service has improved since I last flew them. A340 out and 747 on return were comfortable with excellent seat pitch in economy. B747 had good AVOD. A hot meal is provided which is a welcome return to service and cabin crew are polite and efficient. The first leg was on time but the flight from Manila was dreadful as we were boarded 45 minutes late (terminal 2 is far inferior to terminal 3 - hot crowded noisy and like a greenhouse) but then sat on the stifling plane to sweat for a further 2 hours. Looking at the flight I may stick with Cebu Pacific in future as the PAL terminal building is awful and the very long hot delay was not at all acceptable.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,4.0,yes,7,MNL-YVR. Airbus A340-300. The seat was ok. It has quite a big legroom for a tall man like me. The food was delicious the cabin was clean the Flight attendants have great service. In flight Entertainment is poor.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4.0,yes,10,MNL-YVR on a Boeing 777. Service was good and the food and beverages were tasty. My seat was a window seat and was comfortable. The seat was reclining and the cabin was clean we were given blankets. Enjoyed the inflight entertainment.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,4,On line booking is a challenge and needs an upgrade. I didn't get the seat I booked online for an additional fee. The staff member behind the counter did not speak English nor Filipino. On our way back same thing happened the seat I booked was not given to us. This time the staff member admitted their lack of upgrades in the computer system and worked on changing our seats fast and was apologetic. Never had an on time flight with PAL. The only thing good about it is the cabin crews. They are very nice. Mine and my husband's TV did not work.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,4.0,no,,GUM-MNL-LAO and back. Mediocre Airline. No inflight entertainment No Lounge access at GUM and LAO. Nothing that makes this airline stand-out from the rest.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,,,4.0,yes,8,Nice flight from Manila to Cebu. Plane was very new and the staff very friendly. All in all a perfect flight for this short distance!
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,yes,10,Great service from Manila to Toronto. Meals are tasty lounge is not that elegant but it is clean. Onboard seats are relaxing. Would definitely fly again.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,,,3.0,no,,Manila - Puerto Princesa - Manila (domestic travel). 5 day trip: delayed 3 hours on both legs. Poor communication lack of explanations and terrible customer service. The standard of this is airline is far below that of a budget airline and I will avoid flying with PR in future. A highly disorganised domestic carrier to be avoided.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,3.0,yes,6,Hong Kong to Manila in January 2013 on an A330. Upon arrival in Hong Kong the plane was delayed so we went out of Hong Kong approx 30 mins late. The Service was slow and my selection of food was not available. Also they apparently didn't have any Coke available. Upon arrival in Manila I couldn't help notice that the cabin staff were still cleaning up in the galley just a few minutes before our touch down in Manila. As a European I'm used to that the cabin is usually ready for arrival at least 15 minutes before touch down. There was no personal monitors however for a 2 hour flight that's not an issue for me. They did show some entertainment on a common screen but I didn't watch it. The messages from the captain were good and easy to understand.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5.0,yes,8,Return Vancouver - Manila return on Boeing777. Online booking got me a good seat in the front - not what I call the second class business class back one compartment same as on the Airbus 340. The 777 is not as new as I expected but much better than the tired old 340s. Seats are a bit complicated to figure out with all the controls. Pitch is excellent with lots of room and I had nobody beside me on both legs. This was good as there are no seat pockets to store books or any items. The 777 is better configured and has a nice AVOD system although the choices were somewhat limited in music and TV shows. On the return leg the system crashed at the half way point and never came back on. The 777 is about one hour faster than the 340 and makes the trip a bit faster which is a bonus. Food was okay and service very good and attentive. My last 340 flight last year the cabin crew disappeared after dinner service but on this flight they were always around. On time flights and spacious. Will travel again next year on the 777 for sure - good value.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4.0,yes,9,BKK-MLA. Nice flight with good service. The food was good and the flight attendants delightful. Not much inflight entertainment.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,4.0,no,7,MNL-YVR-LAS return. The flight attendants were generally pleasant and accommodating but slow. The food was good - 4 meals plus one snack for a 14-hour flight so more than sufficient. The seats are not very comfortable they do not support the back or neck well. Fine for short flights but not good for long trips. The seats in the middle rows have ample leg room though the seats by the windows are quite cramped. As for the in-flight entertainment - there is no provision for personal entertainment only a large LCD screen with poor image quality. The same movie was shown twice. Interior of the cabin is not very well-maintained. There were scuff marks the seat covers were not pristine the passenger pamphlets tattered and there was some rubbish left behind by the previous passengers. 3 of the 6 restrooms in Economy had clogged toilets and sinks.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4.0,yes,9,Nov 15 MNL to SIN economy class. The seats are okay and comfortable. The food is excellent and tasty. The cabin crew as always serve with a smile. Aircraft used was A320 and the seats were quite empty at the back of the plane (where I was seated). As to Inflight entertainment this is where I hope they can still further improve. The monitors are shared among the passengers so if you are seated above the monitor or too far then you might find it hard to watch. But at any rate overall the service is okay.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4.0,yes,9,Booked a one-way ticket from Manila to Melbourne. The last time I flew PAL was 4 years ago and I can say that there is a big improvement in terms of service. I only wish they'd start online check-ins. The in-flight entertainment as well as food and beverages were adequate.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,4.0,yes,8,I was forewarned about glitches at check-in due to a computer system upgrade so was prepared for the worst. An agent assisted passengers it was no consolation because check-in seemed to take forever with my frequent flyer number missing and likewise my pre-reserved seat. Commendation however should be given to the in-flight crew who did a superb job with their pleasant service attitude. Food was ample and delicious but where it lacked was in presentation. Midnight snacks offered after dinner which helped quell my hunger due to the long flight (flight skipped the Guam technical stop and so it became a long 14 hour non-stop flight LAX-MNL). Since I flew on a similar aircraft MNL-LAX 19 days earlier I was disappointed however that the legroom on this 747-400 was shorter than the aircraft I flew on earlier. Having been a regular flyer of Philippine Airlines I was pleasantly surprised at the enhancements experienced on over-all service on these flights.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,yes,9,Flew SFO-MNL-BKK. Aircraft 747 was adequate. Compared to top tier carriers Philippine Airlines Business Cabin is cheaper with enough legroom and great food. Staff friendly and attentive. Generally I fly Thai or Singapore to BKK but Philippine Airlines offered the best quality of service for Business travelers for the cheapest fares in Business Class. Would recommend for those who want to save but still have a quality of service.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,4.0,yes,8,MNL-BKK-MNL. Wouldn't normally fly Business Class but found a bargain fare. Was assigned a seat in the former First Class cabin of an old A340 with seats and legroom a couple of notches better than the regular Business Class cabins. Seat showed its age but well maintained and comfortable; was able to lower it into an almost flat position and managed to have a very good nap. Staff attentive and their enthusiasm seemed quite genuine. Nothing fancy in the meal service but the food was tasty and plenty of it - ask for the excellent mango smoothie! Inflight entertainment was sub-par not even as good as economy in the top-tier airlines. Overall very satisfied and will gladly fly with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,10,I flew PAL for the first time on a trip to Manila and Bangkok from Honolulu. The service was good and food was tasty. Flight Attendants were courteous and friendly.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,10,YVR–MNL-YVR (Aug 26 Sep 10). The service was great. The flight attendants were always available to assist passengers and several times they go around to give water and snacks. They serve dinner and breakfast. The food is tasty and comparable with other Asian airlines. The B777-300 aircraft is spotless the legroom is ample the seat will recline and it has personal entertainment system with good selections of movies games and music. Overall PAL did a good job and I will fly with them again.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,10,BKK-MNL business class on the refurbished B747. Flight on time. Meals were tasty. Legroom was ample and seat reclined to around 160 degrees. Asked flight purser to reserve an item for me from their duty-free upon delivery and she gladly delivered it to me right after a few minutes even before take-off. AVOD was also working and offered several options.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,BXU-MNL-HKG-MNL. Basically on time all sectors. As all sectors were 2 hrs or less didn't really miss fancy entertainment system. Cabin crew were good as was the food.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,3,Flight 102 from Manila to LAX July 15 2012 returning home to LA from lovely trip to Thailand. We flew from Bangkok to Manila then Manila to LAX. First flight delayed by 5 hours which prevented us from taking the original second flight. The airline did a good job of trying to reach us about it ground staff in Bangkok did a good job of getting us onto a later flight and ground staff in Manila airport did a good superb job of expediting us from the first flight to the second which had been held for us and seven other people who had the same problem. It had been held an entire hour waiting for those last 9 passengers - with all other passengers on board and apparently no AC. Plane felt like a sauna when we boarded. From here it all goes down hill. This was the most uncomfortable plane I have ever been on. Very little legroom and the seats were unusually narrow so no elbow room. When the guy in front tilted his chair back it felt uncomfortable and intrusive. Food was average except for the fluffy cake desserts. Service was adequate some attendants were nice but others seemed apathetic. We would not choose Philippine Airlines again.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,The new Boeing 777 on the Australia routes (serving MEL and SYD from MNL) makes a huge difference as it has AVOD. Flights were full in economy in both directions with excellent punctuality coming back but half an hour late or so on the forward journey. Overall a good experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,My flight from Iloilo to Manila and on to Los Angeles was really good. The food was good but the inflight entertainment was pretty bad. However I think they are getting new inflight entertainment so I would recommend PAL.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,MNL-YVR-MNL. The service is impeccable. Check-in is a breeze. From ground crew to cabin crew they were hospitable and assist you all the time. Long Haul Business Class is just smooth for nearly 12 hours flight and the entertainment is indeed good. Food is good though it needs more presentation.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,3,Manila to Vancouver April 15 2012. Crowded flight-terminal hot and waiting area over flowing with passengers-long evasive pre-flight baggage check. Plane an old Airbus 340. Seats adequate. Entertainment system terrible with only three channels one so fuzzy could not watch it. Plane was hot and complained twice to no avail. Passenger to my left had a caregiver to attend to her and she blocked the aisle for 30 % of the flight. Staff were pleasant enough and food adequate. Prices have increased to the point where it is poor value for the money. I asked to be seated in the premium business section as I have been a Mabuhay member since 2005. I was refused and I know the section was almost empty. Will never fly PAL again to Canada.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,1,3 flight delays in one trip! HKG-Manila-Tagbilaran City Bohol. For the first flight when we arrived the boarding gate there was no aircraft at HKG for Manila. We waited an hour for departure and arrived in Manila one hour later than scheduled. We asked the crews and interestingly they said the connecting flight to Tagbilaran city would wait for us. After we landed we rushed to transfer desk and were informed that the connecting flight had already departed. Subsequently the airline scheduled us for an early flight the next morning. Arranged shuttle to and from hotel. Return flight from Tagbilaran City to Manila delayed 20mins. When we reached the boarding gate for connecting flight back HKG we almost missed the flight with only 8 mins to spare. No one helped us through the domestic terminal to the international airport. However the flight back HKG was delayed again. Overall total: 25% on time rate!
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,2,I am waiting for my international flight as we speak and I have never been on such a disorganized airline! After passing several gates and several metal detectors and waiting in several lines I wanted to sit relax eat and wander around and shop until my flight. Unfortunately that is not happening because we had to go through an additional line baggage screening pat down and talk to more people at their kiosk! We could not have our water that we just bought inside the gate area and now we are stuck in a roped off area at our gate unable to go out and have lunch or a drink of water! I am so frustrated if only they had checked all of our stuff properly at the gate entrance there would not be this problem of waiting and not being able to leave. This is the first time using Philippine Airlines and I will not be using them again.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,9,CEB-MNL I was excited to try their Mabuhay Class onboard their brand new B777-300ER. I had a great time with them. Check-in was a breeze and boarding was smooth for business class. Seat was very comfortable and I could fly that seat for 16 hours with no discomfort. The B777 features an AVOD. Food was average though it was a pasta meal they served on business class. Landing was smooth as always. I will definitely fly them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,1,Manila to Vancouver. The seat was ok not too crowded nice screen on the seat back to watch movies etc. The female stewardesses were rude with no please or thank you. I had no blanket when I asked the stewardess she told me if it wasn't on my seat it was too bad as there were no more. Aircraft was good  service staff need to be brought up to standards!
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,2,Good food could have done with more liquid refreshment baby bassinet on floor meaning no legroom in bulkhead row reasonable AVOD IFE no airshow (map) on entire plane on return journey. Terrible terminal at MNL for arrivals (1hr wait for immigration 1.5 hr wait for baggage) terrible terminal at MNL for departures (cannot buy liquids airside despite going through 2x security lines little to eat few places to sit aircon broken down). I've flown with Cebu Pacific and PAL before and used all 3 terminals at MNL but this is by far the worst experience so far in so many ways.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,MNL to Tag Bohol. Flight on time flight attendants very professional and service was great. Quite expensive but I will definitely fly them again.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,9,Travelled PR several times already both on International and Domestic routes and on both J and Y class. Impressed that no flight was delayed. Their new safety video catches one's attention. Food is not the best but not the worst one either. PAL may be a bit expensive compare to other local airlines but you get what you paid for.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,7,Cotabato (RPMC) to Manila (RPLL). I was not impressed nor disappointed. Flight delayed 45 minutes. The service was fine. The cabin crew were very professional very informative displays however their inflight snack was a let down. Aircraft was an Airbus A319. Although there was enough leg room the space is still so limited that you cannot go to the washroom without disturbing other passengers. My return flight to Cotabato was a little bit better. Delayed only 20 minutes the plane was Airbus A320 the snack was a little better considering they served coffee that day and the cabin crew professional as always. However the cabin was too hot.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,7,MNL-PEK-MNL on an airbus 320. New clean with good legroom even in economy. No personal AVOD only overhead screens but a good movie selection. Both flights on time and inflight catering was good with ice cream served. Flight attendants very professional.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,5,Hostesses were great the plane was clean and the food average. The entertainment was below standard on the flight from Melbourne to Manila I could only see a screen 8 rows in front of me in the next section. They need to lift their game to get more westerners to fly with them. If you want the whole package fly Singapore or New Zealand.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,6,BKK-MNL-KLO return O/N in Manila on outbound trip. First leg non-refurbished 747-400 A319 on flights to and from KLO and A330 return to BKK. All flights were delayed IFE was on overhead monitors and bulkhead screen. Seat comfort was okay service was professional. Vegetarian Meal was tasty and drinks snacks and ice cream were served. Some passengers weren't given their meal preference as it had run out and were given what was left. Overall experience was not bad but not great either. I flew PAL for the scheduling and destinations and would fly with them again based on price and routing.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,,Cancelled flight from Cebu to Narita and didn't tell the passengers until after 8 hours waiting in the terminal. Never offered any compensation. Plane left the following day like nothing happened and everything was normal. A truly non-caring airline towards customers.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,yes,4,MNL-CEB-MNL. No problems with check-in and security in Manila. NAIA Terminal 2 was a bit spartan but much nicer compared to the dreaded old NAIA 1. Boarding this non-AVOD A330 (filthy inside and out) and departing 30 minutes behind schedule. No blankets or pillows offered. No service except for some peanuts/crackers and coffee/tea/water. Safety video not played and a live manual demo was done. Overhead screens not functioning not even the airshow. Inflight magazine missing from all Economy Class seats. Seats fairly comfortable legroom much better than Cebu Pacific but lesser than Korean Air. Carpets and footrest are filthy. Cebu airport is in a bad state though check-in was not a hassle. Return flight on A330 equipment change from a 747. Same complaints concerning the overhead bins and food/drinks however this time overhead screens were functioning but only airshow was shown and a live safety demo was done in lieu of airing a safety video. In short mediocre (but not poor) experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,6,Generally good service and comfortable flight purchased ticket on Philippine Airlines where the website stated it included a meal. This was a small packet of peanuts and soft drink! This does not represent good value when compared to the other budget airlines operating in the Philippines. Flights are often delayed cancelled or simply amalgamated with flights of their sister airline Phil Air Express.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,9,SGD-MNL. Check-in was fast and the ground crew were friendly. The plane took of with a 10 min delay. The food was really good and were provided with blankets for the night flight.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,6,LAX-MNL-CEB-MNL-LAX. Flight to MAN from LAX was very uneventful food was passable refurbished 747-400. Comfortable seats good friendly service. MAN-CEB on a refurbished 747-400 good service again although they do not let you use your cell phone while waiting for pushback. Return trip from CEB-MAN used the new 777 it was spacious seats were comfortable and aircraft was clean. MNL-LAX plane delayed 30 mins in MAN 747 was not refurbished stuffing coming out of seats plane had to divert to Sapporo Japan to fix ventilation system but the staff were friendly in helping us with the problem.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,Departing for Narita on B777. Smooth check-in. Nice plane. Clean cabin but the seating scheme is awkward! Less choices of magazines. Nice food and attendants however music and movies need updating.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,,Aircraft interior was aged and in serious need of upgrade. Inflight entertainment system was old screens were colourless and almost impossible to see. Inflight safety instruction via said screens could not be seen from where I was sitting. Cabin temperature was hot and humid complaints to cabin staff were ignored. Food quality and service was very bad for an international carrier. Service is lax and uninterested.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,5,PVG-MNL. Nothing great and nothing bad. Typical Philippine airline equipment problem my foot rest had been broken for a while. Entertainment was by a large screen and poor choices of entertainment. It seems it is the little things that dog this airline in addition to the chaos of going to MNL airport.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,9,Sydney to Manila return flight Manila-Melbourne-Sydney. Plane delayed in Sydney due to a problem loading cargo. Aircraft on both trips A340 no personal screens but radio was great and entertainment on overhead screens decent. Plane comfortable and spacious compared to A330. Food was good. More than enough food on return trip. Cabin and lavatory very clean. Staff friendly. Inflight magazine interesting plus exclusive terminal in Manila is convenient. Both flights were pleasant.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,SGP-MNL-LAX. All except one flight was delayed. Did not really like the A320. A bit to small and only had overhead screens. Boeing 747 was a lot better. Interior was new and had personal TV screens. Flight to LAX even took off 10 mins early. Overall I think PAL should just refurbish their airbus A320's to the ones like the Boeing 747. Terminal 2 should also be expanded and renovated.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,3,I flew to Manila and return to Australia on the 25 Jan. On my trip back to Australia we left Manila at 9 am and arrived Sydney at 8 pm - we had one main meal all day and a snack before we landed Sydney. I paid $2000 for my return airfares to Manila and I ended up hungry. I think we pay enough airfares to be served a decent amount of food. There was also a mix up with my seat I checked in at 5 am only to find somebody else sitting in my seat however in the end staff sorted it out.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,6,MNL-CGK-MNL. Terminal 2 check-in was fine though Jakarta was very slow. On time departures and arrivals on all flights. Food and drinks choices were okay. All in all okay flights the price was nothing special.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,7,"HKG-MNL MNL-TAG and TAG-MNL. Chose B777-300ER service out of HKG. Seat width a bit limited due to layout but pitch is good. Seat pitch usual A320 layout on domestic flights which is tight in economy. IFE on 777 is good. Good choice for short flight. Overhead screens on domestic sectors. FA's the usual PAL staff. Some (very) friendly and some ""only"" professional. Could do with consistency on the friendly side. Flights during service provider transition period. But hot meal available on international leg. Choice and quality was good. Better than CX that only serve a bun. No internet check-in available. Overall value for money."
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,7,SIN-MNL-LAX. SIN to MNL on A320 - 5 hours no personal IFE (only drop-down overhead LCD TV) only breads and drinks were available FA's were hiding for majority of the time. Seat was okay nothing special about this flight. MNL to LAX: it was the old un-refurbished 747-400. Ground staff were helpful but the security check line took forever. Even though I had to wait for about 10 hrs in the airport they only gave us two food vouchers. In the 744 no personal IFE they only put the map on the big LCD projector seat was okay meal was not attractive but it was delicious however they served it a bit late. FA was attentive bathroom and cabin were not that clean but still okay. I chose Philippine Airlines because I got very cheap tickets ($ 700 for SIN-LAX return trip).
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,2,Called and reserved window seat and that also fully reclined. I got a window seat just infront of emergency exit. The seat did not recline. Flight was supposed to be non-stop but stopped in Hawaii for over 1 hour to off load and receive passengers. Checked my ticket and printed itinerary it all said non-stop. Good thing for me I had no connecting flight I had to meet in limited time. On the return reserved window seat that reclined however seems they changed the plane from a 747-400 to something that looked like it could only hop from island to island. I had 2 choices and chose the lesser of two evils that still required me to get out of my seat no less than 12 times to allow people to go to and from the rest room and visit friends. There was no stop at Hawaii on the return trip. Seats not made for long haul and very uncomfortable after only 1 hour. Service was mediocre. Food was ok.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,1,Manila to Jakarta on A320. Crew lack courtesy asking passenger to pass on meals to their seat mates. Crew would pass on blankets headphones and even meal boxes on top of people's heads and sometimes a row away from the recipient. Food is awful and is not served in paper boxes. Coffee is now served in styrofoam which is environmentally unfriendly. PAL has downgraded its meal service. I think PAL should now be identified as a budget airline rather than a 3 star airline even if their fares are almost the same as other 5 star airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,7,LAS-MNL MNL-HKG HKG-LAS. Average trip all but one flight arrived on time. Food is so-so. Flight from HKG- MNL loaded and ready 15 mins early but due to ATC delays left almost 1 hr late. Crew were informative and apologetic. Extra $50 for Economy Plus seat worth it on LAS-MNL segment. Transfer from HKG flight in Manila to LAS flight is a test of your patience no direct gate to gate access. You go to the Transfer Desk they take your passport and boarding pass confirm they have located your luggage. Escort you upstairs to passport control through a metal detector and patdown then to the gate for a final passport inspection. Only then are you allowed to proceed to the boarding gate. All this for a same airline flight transfer. We were then an hour late leaving MNL. No seatback IVOD and screens were hard to see.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,2,Not a fan. Have now made 4 business class trips from LAX-MNL or SFO-MNL. B747s in Business Class are OK but the Airbus is old and the business class seats uncomfortable and sub-standard. The food is horrible. Can't give it a good rating.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,3,CGK-MNL-FUK. The seat was old the plane was dirty with water flowing from the lavatory. There's no pillow or blanket left for me no explanation just they left me freezing. The food is okay on my transit time at NAIA they gave passengers a coupon for breakfast but they don't give any information as to where we can use it. Shocked that there was no personal TV and the headset do not work well.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,8,MNL-CEB-MNL. From MNL check-in was quick and easy until we get to the waiting area of Terminal 2 which was packed with people early in the morning which was understandable considering it was peak season. We were delayed about 20-30 mins. On boarding the A330-300 the seat was fairly comfortable although I think the legroom was a little small. The cabin crew were alright the cabin temperature good enough. On the return check- in was quick and easy delayed again for 30 mins. Before boarding one of PAL's newest B777-300ER the cabin ambience was good and everything felt good the seats were new and comfortable legroom roomy good IFE system this plane is more comfortable than the older A330. Cabin crew were nice and accommodating the second flight was the real value for our money.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,9,MNL-SYD return. I was expecting a newer/refurbished plane but unfortunately it was an old one. Food was acceptable nothing special. Toilets were clean. Flights a few minutes delayed. What won me over however were the hospitable flight attendants. Smiling and courteous.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,9,MNL-PPS on Business Class. Pleasantly surprised when they replaced the aircraft to the A330 for this domestic flight (instead of the A320). Good service with full breakfast in Mabuhay Class. Flight attendants excellent and focused on attending to passengers needs.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,,TPE-MNL-VAN. The food is awful seats are old worn out and cramped (Airbus A340). Service is poor with stewardesses and ground staff dismissive if you can get their attention. Shared TV with few screens. They now charge $50 for an exit row seat. If you need to transfer in Manila be warned: the transfer process involves a lot of pointless hanging around.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,no,4,If you're flying to Manila you can avoid the awful international terminal by flying Philippine Airlines (PAL). In the past 3 months I have flown twice a month on PAL and over 70% of the time they are late. It's only when you're checked in and sitting in the lounge that the inevitable delays are announced. Even 4 hr delays appear to take PAL by surprise. The aircraft are ok cabins a little shabby.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,SFO-MNL. Flight over was not refurbished plane old video monitors broken and one of our seats wouldn't recline however they did change our seats. Food is good but for a westerner would like to see more choices other than traditional plates. Even special meals are geared toward Asian cultures. Went to PAL office in Manilla to complain about being sold a ticket under false advertisement when website shows updated planes. Staff called me after visit to office to tell me the plane on the return would be an updated plane. On the return the seats were electric lie flats great pillows and blankets and the same FA's were on both legs. The FA's have always been professional personable and eager to make your trip enjoyable. Definitely worth the extra money for a long trip.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,9,LAX-SIN via MNL. The LAX-MNL had a 50 min fuel stop in HNL. The flight left LAX late and arrived HNL late but the delay was made up for on the HNL-MNL leg. Boarding was the usual LAX chaos. The mabuhay (business) class seating on the LAX-MNL 744 flight was the airline's new seat which is a sloped 170 degree recliner. The seat was a bit firm due to the newness but comfortable and I was able to get a bit of sleep. The IFE was on par with Delta and United i.e. nothing special. The food was very mediocre but the cabin service was outstanding. The MNL-SIN leg was operated by a 320 with standard short haul business class product. The seats were adequate for a 3.5 hr flight. The food was marginally better than the LAX-MNL leg but cabin service was again outstanding. Overall PR offers very good value considering that their business class fares were significantly cheaper than the competition on the LAX-SIN route.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,1,SFO to MNL Roundtrip. Flying to Manila the sinks in the lavatory was clogged and dirty water was overflowing. The security tape around the toilet had peeled off. The service was substandard. When processing through Manila Airport to return back to SFO three security check points failed to detect two bottles of water bottle of gel lighters and a small pocket knife I used while fishing. The flight back was substandard - 14 hours of no entertainment because both our screens wouldn't work. The flight attendants didn't care and their subsequent customer service support was very poor.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,yes,6,Jakarta to Manila en route Singapore using A320. Seats worn out with audio that does not function. Toilet seems to be run down and not well maintained. Food is good but needs improvement in quantity and quality. Attendants food service is extremely slow. PAL's price is no longer competitive or cheaper compared to other airlines serving the route such as SQ but the latter's service is far better than Philippine Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,5,MNL-SGP. Was told flight has been delayed till 1800h then was again told flight has been delayed and was finally told at 1845h that flight has been cancelled. The staff was of no help at all and could not answer any questions being asked by passengers. No explanation was given for the cancellation. PAL could have done better in handling such situation.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,MNL-YVR-MNL B777-300ER. Service and inflight entertainment great. Each economy seat has it's own AVOD. Food was good.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,,MNL-SFO-MNL. Service extremely poor Manila to San Francisco travelling with a child. We were charged US$100 for requesting bassinet seats for our child and the lady beside us travelling with babies wasn't charged at all! We then discovered no bassinets were available. We completed a formal complaint on the plane regarding the overcharge and no response from Philippine Airlines has been forthcoming. On the way back from San Francisco to Manila we were only charged $US50 for seats with a bassinet. The policy isn't consistent! Terminal two in manila travelling to SFO was just appalling - the lines were not organised.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,MNL-TAG-MNL. Flights on time. Check-in quick and very friendly in MNL not always the case. Cabin crew good but still the same pattern. Men and elder lady FAs friendly. Some of the younger ladies more interested in their appearance than being there for passengers. Snacks fine and choice of water coffee and tea. No OJ anymore but second runs. All in all a good experience for the price paid.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,MNL–SIN–MNL. Arrived on time but spend quite some time since there is a long line in the check-in counter good enough I got a window-seat. Inflight entertainment is average - A340-300 and not the Boeing B777 with AVOD. Inflight meal is tasty and good enough for a 3.5 hours flight. Flight attendants hospitable and helpful. Flight back the same long line in the check-in meal was fantastic.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,4,SYD-MNL-SYD B777 is quite new and IFE was good enough for a 7-hour flight although the movie channel on MNL-SYD was unavailable for the first two hours. SYD-MNL food was average flight attendant in our cabin section was friendly. MNL-SYD plane actually left on time but staff was rude and abrupt with service. It was more the female staff who looked like they were afraid their make-up would crack if they smiled.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,7,MNL-SIN return economy. Check in at MNL terminal 2 was slow but moving considering the number of flights departing and the limited ground crew available. Traveling with 3 kids we were allowed to board early Crew on both legs (same ones) very friendly and chatting with passengers and helping with carry on baggage to facilitate boarding. An hour before landing my youngest had severe motion sickness and the flight attendants were quick to help me clean up the mess and freshen the air. Food however was terrible both legs.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,7,I had limited expectations for my flight from LAX-Manila. Yes the cabin interior is a bit tired Business seat was not flat food won't blow anyone away and AVOD had limited selections but it wasn't bad. We made the scheduled intermediate stop in Hawaii to add fuel and then another 11 hours to Manila from there. The service was fine and FA's were friendly enough. All in all I would say that it wasn't bad and if you would rather get there a little faster then this is an OK option.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,9,HKG-MNL Economy class. The flight wasn't delayed (I seem to remember this being a regular occurence at Manila airport). The cabin crew were friendly and no problem when I requested an emergency exit seat. The ticket price was great so no complaints.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,9,YVR-LAS-YVR A340. A lot of legroom and space on A340. Clean restrooms good food choices for the 2.5 hour transborder flights. IFE only showed the airshow. FA's very nice quick service. At YVR the airport displayed the gate area wrong so the ground staff came looking for us instead of using the PA's. Very nice as they lead us to the gate directly.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,MNL-TPE-MNL Used this airline for the 3rd time this year in international flights and more than 5 in domestic flights and the service remained the same. Friendly service from ground staff and cabin crew seat pitch adequate check-in service a breeze inflight entertainment average. The inflight catering is getting more mediocre than before taste sometimes bland and choices limited.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,7,Cebu to Boracay RT. Used PAL Express/Airphils. Both flights on a Q300. Very comfortable seats. Flights all left on-time. FAs were very friendly. No food or drinks which was a negative. Not even BOB! Cabin was super warm A/C broke. Overall not bad for a short flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,4,Kathmandu to Hong Kong. It is the cheapest anyone can have in this route but so are the facilities. The cabin crew are friendly the seats are old and not comfortable there is no entertainment during the flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,SYD-MNL given aisle seat and pretty comfortable on A330. Food wasn't too bad. MNL-MEL nice ground staff bag had 5kgs over allowance on a fully booked flight and was checked in. Onboard food was disappointing.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,7,Manila to Narita flight on their new 777 good legroom on economy equipped with the latest in flight entertainment personal AVOD. Food was good and they gave ice cream and cakes for dessert. Return flight on older A330 no personal IFE food also good. Cabin crew professional and service was average to good. Overall good value for what you paid for compared to Delta who is operating also on the same route (direct).
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,10,MNL-SYD. Check-in swift B777-300ER with a clean interior. Cabin Crew professional attentive to safety and delivered service with a smile. Call bells were promptly answered. The dinner was delicious. Y Class touches included footrests small amenity kit with eye shades newspapers offered USB access at each seat easy to use IFE with great audio and video choices and cabin announcements were kept to a minimum by the crew resulting in minimal disruption for the night flight. The only setback was the cabin temperature which was kept very cold. Would certainly fly PAL again as they provided a friendly service which was value for money.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,9,CGY-MNL. Check-in very fast and agent friendly. A319 seats very comfortable legroom aso good. FAs friendly - 4 FAs serving the economy section. Peanuts and cookies served. IFE is drop- down LCDs airshow map then a tv show.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,yes,6,RUH-MNL. B747-400 is not refurbished interior of aircraft showing its age. Seats are not comfortable overhead bin are shaking inflight entertainment is very poor. FA friendly and professional food excellent. The advantage is direct flight from Riyadh to Manila. I hope PAL will use new aircraft on this route - it should be equipped with better inflight entertainment and comfortable seats.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,3,KTM-HKG. Food was good service was nice. Cabin crew would promptly attend to you when you buzz them. Ticket was cheap compared to other airlines flying KTM to HKG. All in all would fly again with them if they keep their on-time schedule.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,Manila to Melbourne business class in new 777 and was very pleased by the experience. Only problem was arriving early and having to wait for quarantine officers to arrive. The seats lack privacy but comfortable (not lie flat) good service and good IFE. Food average.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,MNL-ILO-CEB-MNL in economy class. Check-in was fast and efficient. Offered coffee tea juices and some peanuts and biscuits during these short flights which I think reasonably ok. Newer planes and friendly service from the attentive cabin crew.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,9,(HGK-MNL) One way business class. Surprising good experience. check in was fast business class lounge was excellent. Plenty of food drinks periodicals. Excellent service in flight. Too bad the little things hurt PAL. Seat was not fully operational. Luggage was the first on the carousel. I have had good experience with PAL in Biz class and will continue to use them into Manila.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,7,SFO-MNL-SIN businessrefurbished 747-400 with Recaro seats. Service very good. Seats are not proper lie flat). I found it hard to sleep for long periods as I kept sliding down. Food was very good though wine service was odd. I had to select red or white wine before the meal and there didn't seem to be an option to switch between courses. Transfer in Manila was very weird. They weighed my hand luggage and I had to remove my laptop to show that it was under some weight limit (I had no questions or issues in SFO). Manila business class lounge is an utter joke. Mind you SFO lounge is not that much better.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,MNL-PPS-MNL. A320 outbound clean service friendly - only tea/coffee and nibbles but only one hour flight. US$100 return fare very reasonable. A330 on return also near new and excellent service again.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,MNL-SFO B747-400 business class had the new interior with new seating carpets and panels. The seats are angled lie flat type but much more comfortable than the old. Service was impeccable. Meals were very good. Only wine choices were red or white. Did not use the personal video as this was a night flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,5,BKK-MNL-BKK. I usually avoid PAL after a few bad experiences mainly around delays but both flights were one time. Cabin was full both times and meal service was fine with plenty of drinks rounds even in the middle of the night. IFE was broken on my seat both flights but other than that the A320 was modern clean and comfortable. I still prefer the budget airlines for regional routes around Asia. Philippine Airlines are expensive and I'd rather have the money in my pocket than a meal a movie and mabuhay miles.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,Manila-Kalibo-Manila Business Class. Domestic Business Class check in was quick. Domestic Business Class lounge with attentive waiters. Limited food selection but the soup was very good. My wife and I received attentive service as we were the only passengers in business class. Pre-flight orange juice offered but inflight sandwiches and some fruits was unappetizing. Check in at Kalibo Airport was chaotic although there were only about 50 passengers on the line. Again no priority boarding for business class passengers. Business Class cabin full on this flight. FAs attentive and friendly. Pre-flight orange juice offered. Inflight meal was again a dissapointment. A320 seats in business class for both flights are comfortable but showing their age.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,BKK-MNL return in Business. In BKK the lounge is Thai Royal Silk which is good quality. A320 new and everything worked including AVOD with a good selection. Business seat similar to US domestic first class - big seat but not much recline. Food was OK and service was attentive and personal no complaints.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,,BKK-MNL. Flight crew was lacking. Whilst some were making an effort one was completely unprofessional and was rude. Whatever happened to PAL Smiles and Filipino hospitality? I guess they're only reserved for foreign passengers. Everyone else in Business Class might as well sit in Economy because they get Economy service.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,5,Business Class from Manila to Cebu and back. Philippine Airlines utilizes its A330 for the Cebu route making the flight quick and relaxing. Disappointing were the meals in-flight - not as good as it used to be. Good thing they serve their trusty old Arroz Caldo in all their Mabuhay lounges. A well stocked bar free WiFi and reading materials made the wait at these lounges pleasant. Flight attendants remain young for the domestic routes and service was still friendly. PTV's in the A330 need to be replaced as they were all not functioning properly and did not have enough channels to choose from. Lavatories were clean. Arriving at both airports was smooth and Mabuhay Class passengers get their luggage before everyone else.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,yes,6,YVR-MNL-YVR in economy class A340-300. Planes were old seat not comfortable and pitch must have been 30-31 inches. Older FA was rude but younger ones were polite. They seem to be in a rush serving dinne as soon as take off. An hour after dinner I needed water but no FA in sight - waited for 10 mins then pressed call button. FA didn't come until 15 mins later and was rude - seems like I bothered them. An hour later I walked down the aisle to the business class area and took a peak. There was no passenger in there all I saw was FAs sitting and some were sleeping. Now the lack of service started to make sense.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,7,HKG-MNL-HKG 320/330 Check in at HKG and Manila went smoothly so was the boarding and Immigration. Onboard food was good and the service was better with the female crew then the male crew. All flights was on time and aircraft in good shape.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,7,MNL-TPE-MNL in Economy class. Check-in at NAIA Terminal 2 a breeze. A320 new food was served immediately and good enough for a 2-hour flight while inflight entertainment was average. Flight attendants hospitable. On the return leg again check-in a breeze the plane this time is quite old Airbus A320. Inflight entertainment needs to be updated.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,3,SFO-MNL. Business class was showing its age and lack comfort. Meals average with poor presentation. The crew were literally non existent and when present did not smile.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,6,MNL-BKK return Business class. Tickets were not that cheap compared to TG so I question the value of putting up with slow clumsy service old seats and bad food. MNL-BKK leg started well with pre take of drinks and hot towels. Food orders were taken and meals were served properly. Food quality was mediocre at best. BKK-MNL was disappointing. No pre take off drinks or towels. Food orders taken but service was slow while they appeared rushed. Lots of spilling and plates falling on the floor. Food was inedible. For a little more money TG would be a world of difference for the same route.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,no,2,KLO-MNL return flight was my worst experience. Flight attendants not friendly at all not even smiling. Also they let the passengers put the baggage in the overhead compartments even when the aircraft is taxing to the runway they'll ask you to remove your seatbelt and stand-up to put that baggage. The announcements are simple and not detailed compared to the other local airlines. MNL-NRT by Philippine airlines and that was another a worst experience. My seat was broken and cannot be reclined.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,MNL-ZAM return. Fairly new A320 well-maintained tight seat pitch but adequate. Flights on time with good information from flight deck. Cabin crew efficient: on domestic flights only tea/coffee and nibbles are offered. Generally a good in-flight experience. On the ground check-in staff are strict on weight - expect to pay if you have in excess of 15kg hold baggage for domestic flights. Also have local currency to pay the 200 peso departure tax at all airports. Overall the flight experience compared very favourably with domestic and regional flying in UK and Europe.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,yes,7,BCD-MNL-BCD. A320 Plane was not the reffited one - AirAsia (a budget airline) have more comfortable seats and leg room. Crew nice and chatty to some passengers but to the rest polite only. Majority of PAL crew need more training in following filipino hospitality. Some are robotic or rude some also back-stab the airline to passengers. The only difference with Economy Light is that you get assigned the most back seats and no peanuts and skyflakes.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,TPE-LAX via MNL in business. All flights on time cabin clean food good and staff professional. Bathrooms kept clean. Only letdowns were the inflight entertainment system and the lounge in Manila (it looks more like a dormitory lounge than what should be the airline's flagship lounge). Very good value for money.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,1,Philippines Airlines Business Class - there is space which you'd expect but the cabin was horrible and in my return Manila-Honolulu flight I changed seats 4 times to find a seat that worked correctly or a TV screen that would hold itself up. The plane was very old and to be honest a bit scary. I hope they maintain the engines better than they do the cabin. I fly business class on flights over 7 hours and this was the worst experience I have ever had. This airline is brutal with excess luggage - even 1Kg is charged (on this sector) US$150 -this is what they tried to charge me for my surfboard coming back from Honolulu. The confusing part for me is they didn't charge me to go over with it so I was shocked when they tried to charge me at Honolulu. I talked my way out of it and I could see the person had heard it all before as she tired of saying the same thing.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,6,MNL-Kalibo-MNL and MNL-HKG. Domestic service usual PAL service. Noticed that some ground staff and cabin crew members tend to be friendlier to Caucasian travellers than Pinoy people. Check- in quick and baggage delivery on both legs alright. MNL-HKG: PAL has cut on the meal as no longer any bread on the tray. Service efficient in the PAL manner. One thing PAL has to address is their ground staff. They make you feel they do you a favour by checking you in. Although travelling on two tickets (party of 3 people) as I only needed a one way ticket we checked in together. She managed to sit us apart. We had to return to the check in counter to get seats assigned next to each other. All in all a 3 star airline that could be more if they would take more attention to details. An upgrade of NAIA2 facilities would do well as well i.e. domestic terminal flights are allocated to check in counters in a way no one understands and they are written down on a paper printout. Noticed that number of FAs onboard international flights is very high though one does not notice it service wise.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,LAX-MNL/MNL-LAX. Philippine Airlines new Business Class product which I was quite pleased with. The cabin was clean modern and fully staffed. They have the new angled lie flat seats which are quite nice. Entertainment system pretty good. The dinner service was excellent. The only glitch is the wine list - only two choices. The service in general was warm friendly and sincere. The over all in flight product is good and a great value for your money. However reservations and check in can be touched up a bit.
,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,8,YVR-SIN-YVR in Business Class. Older A340's non stop Vancouver- Manila and new A320's on the Manila - Singapore. A340 is showing its age and business class seating is old style (their 747's have been refurbished to the new biz style but not the A340) the service on board was attentive and professional. The food was very good and well presented. A few drink runs would have been appreciated without having to press the call button. Very good lounges (shared) were provided in both Vancouver and Singapore while the Philippine Airlines Mabuhay Lounge in Manila was available during the transit stop. The Manila lounge does let the product down as it is nowhere as nice as the others. Service and food on the regional flight between Manila and Singapore was as good as long haul. Luggage both ways was handled in priority manner. Overall a very satisfactory product especially for the price PAL charge for their business when compared to some alternatives.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,4,KTM-BKK Flight in March 2009 as it was only half the price of Thai. Booking Check-in and Boarding went surprisingly without problem or delay. B757 is pretty old but clean inside. The staff provided a good service with a hot meal and passengers are provided with the Thai immigration papers. The inflight entertainment is outside the window as you see lots of the Himalayas for the first 40 mins after departure.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,,BKK-KTM economy. B-757 pleasant and clean. This was the cheapest option BKK-KTM and our expectations were low. We were surprised! Very friendly and serviceminded cabin staff in traditional local dresses. Good language skills and plenty of information from the captain and FA. Good local food. Arrival on time despite delay from BKK. No baggage problems and high level of service in KTM intl airport. An overall positive experience in spite of lack of IFE. I would definitely choose Royal Nepal Airlines again and have recommended others to fly them.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,,HKG-KTM. On the whole not bad left on time Cabin crew friendly. Plane a bit dated magazine was fairly informative. The best thing was the food hot fresh and tasty.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,,I am a Nepalese and well used to the awful standards of Nepal Airlines formerly Royal Nepal Airlines. If you are thinking of flying by Nepal Airlines don't ! Pay the extra and find another carrier. They have been operating their international services with two ancient Boeing 757s and both were grounded in early May resulting in the cancellation of all their international flights. These long delays and cancellations have happened to me several times in the past and I now pay the extra money and fly by Thai Airways on the same route. If you are lucky enough to take off the meals and wines are good and the crews are efficient enough and do speak English regardless of any previous comments on this site. I want to be proud of my national carrier but at the moment it is a complete shambles and I advise everybody not to fly on this airline.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,,I had the misfortune of making a booking on Royal Nepal Airlines from Kathmandu to Delhi. Little did I know that this was the worst airline I had ever encountered. I had a connecting flight at Delhi. On the morning of my departure I arrived at the airport only to discover that the flight had been cancelled. I was told to return to Kathmandu as the offices opened at 10am. Only after we myself and a few other passengers refused to go away did the ground staff make a plan to get us on an alternative flight with Sahara Airlines. On arriving at Delhi there was absolutely no Royal Nepal Airlines staff to meet us to try and arrange alternative flights or even provide support in any way. It cost me about $700 to make alternative arrangements as I had missed my connecting flight. Never use Royal Nepal Airlines they are absolutely useless.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,,KTM-HKG Business Class. Arriving at the airport we were faced with huge lines to get in as all baagage had to be x-rayed prior to check in. No agent present at the business class check in counter so my wife and I proceeded to the economy check in. Only one person in front. The agent was friendly and soon gave us our boarding passes with the Economy Class name crossed out and Business Class written by hand - nice. Flight was delayed due to late arrival of aircraft - not an unusual occurrence with Royal Nepal - most people are just thankful the flight's not cancelled. Flight departed an hour and a half late though we arrived just 20 minutes past our scheduled arrival time. On board there were 2 FA for the 9 people sitting up front (including 2 relief pilots). Meals were fine and service was friendly. No inflight entertainment - only international news magazines and newspapers were available. FAs came around frequently to check if everything was ok. Overall an ok experience - the staff usually try their best but are let down by shoddy management ageing planes and poor infrastructure at the airport.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,,Granted this airlines has lot of problems I disagree with the comment that airline crew speak little to no English. Their English is quite good actually. In fact better than lot of airlines in South East Asia.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,,I would agree with everyone in terms of Royal Nepal Airlines and its timings and delays. However those are not the only problems this airline faces. It has only two aircrafts (the 757-200 and the 757-200C) which have no form of entertainment onboard the cabin crew only speak Nepali Hindi and very little or no English. And they know no other language which is quite important considering most tourists are from Japan and France who will definitely have a lot to complain about. Being Nepali I have had to fly this airline thrice and all the flights turned out to be as bad as the last one. The airline personnel in Delhi for RNAC is the worst I've ever come across as well. All these problems are probably due to corruption.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,,Royal Nepal Airlines - you cannot depend upon its timing and the airline should take care of time.
