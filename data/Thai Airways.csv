✅ Trip Verified ,A320-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Chiangmai,August 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"   We had a very good experience with Thai Airways staff during our trip from Bangkok to Chiangmai (TG 164). My wife had accident before flight and was unable to walk normally. During check-in at Suvarnabhumi airport, the young male staff at check-in counter was very kind and helpful. He tried to find the front row seat to move my wife from the back row seat but was unable to do so because the flight was fully booked. Therefore, he arranged wheelchair service for my wife to the gate. Unfortunately, this flight would depart from bus gate not normal gate with Jet bridge and my wife was unable to walk up by stair to airplane. Thai Airways staff at the gate were very helpful and kind enough to prepare the Lift bus to take my wife to the plane’s side door and also prepare special wheelchair that can move in aisle of the plane as we were seat in Row 54. The cabin staff were very attentive and helpful as well. The flight was good, arrived a little late due to heavy traffic at airport of departure. The service by cabin staff was very good and friendly indeed. They served us with snack (green curry bun - very tasty) and a bottle of mineral water. We really appreciated excellent service by Thai Airways staff both ground and flight crew."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Heathrow to Melbourne via Bangkok,July 2024,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,1,yes,6,"  LHR - BKK. Not a bad flight. Flew the other way last month and the plane felt more quiet and comfortable than this one. I ordered a special meal because of allergies, but they either gave it to someone else or didn't have it on board, so I ended up having to have a kids meal. I'm a big guy and was left hungry. No snacks on the flight or water handed out. Really frustrating when they dont on long hauls. Also discriminating that I have to pay for an exit seat because of my excessive height. I'll start an online petition soon so tall people hopefully won't have to pay anymore to be as comfortable as other people on aeroplanes. I used to get them for nothing, but now airlines charge for those seats, just to make more money (after Covid). We shouldn't have to pay! Second meal on the flight was also insufficient. Entertainment lacks too, quality of films is poor and the amount too. Same movies as 6 weeks ago, not sure how often they're changed. Luckily I had Netflix on my phone or I'd of been very bored. TV shows very basic and not much range of English speaking ones too. Staff are great, cleanliness of the plane too. BKK - MEL. Very comfortable seat. OK entertainment, but could be more variety for English speaking people. Food was great. They didn't have the meal I requested, but they sorted me out and I was very happy. Same entertainment on TA for the last 6 weeks, so if you do a return flight with them choose what you watch carefully, as there's a limited amount of shows and movies. Great staff as always, and always clean and tidy in the bathrooms. When at BKK I was given the wrong seat (I'd paid for exit row as im very tall), they said I couldn't have it unless I paid again, which was very frustrating. Eventually after 45minutes at the counter and showing them all my documents, they changed it. A bit ridiculous really considering I had proof I'd paid for the seat(s). There were many empty ones anyway. Good flight overall. I booked last minute and paid a lot for it. I was shown only a few empty seats, however, there were a lot upon boarding. Slightly misleading. That's why Im giving 1 star for value for money."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Perth,July 2024,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,4.0,2,no,6,  A round trip PER-BKK . Both flights were delayed without explanation. The business class seats are at the lower level of quality .If you are seated in a window seat you have to step over an adjoining passenger to reach the aisle. The seats are old and narrow and very uncomfortable for sleep and on my seat the light did not work . The Screen is very small and is situated on the back of the seat in front. The food from Perth was of a good standard but from Bangkok there was no European breakfast available and the Coffee and bread that were offered were cold. All in all a far cry from the old Thai experience. BKK remains one of the least passenger friendly airports and the walk from the plane to immigration was a tad under a kilometre. The good news was that the baggage that was labelled priority actually did arrive as priority and that is a rare occurrence these days . I would not fly on a longer segment with Thai until they upgraded their planes.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Copenhagen to Bangkok,May 2024,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,3,no,3," They damaged my luggaged in several places. Pierre is a good quality luggage and it was the third time I used it. The weight did not exceed 25 kgs so, it could not have been a heavy luggage. I made a complaint and it took 3 weeks for them to reply asking me to send pictures of the damage. I sent the pictures the same day. Then, didn't hear from them like 2 weeks again. Then, they replied for the second time and asked me to take the luggage to the repair shop and they will reimburse the expense. I went to the repair shop with my luggage and the expert on the luggage said that the cost to repair will not be cheap and suggested it is rather better to buy a new luggage or put a duct tape. I don't want to put a duct tape on my nice luggage and replied to Thai Airways on 6th june and they have not replied me until today (21st July). Definitely not flying with them again and will definitely not recommend anyone."
Not Verified ,A350-900,Business,Business Class,Sydney to Bangkok,July 2024,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,4, Took Thai business class first time to Bangkok. From SYD normally I take Qatar or Qantas! Was over 7 kg weight limit due to tight allowance compared to others they charged me $450 extra! Top service in air& food but $450 extra for 7 kg bus class ticket was too much! No more Thai for me!
Not Verified ,A350,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Hong Kong,January 2024,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4,yes,7,  The staff are friendly and the seat is comfortable. The air ticket is a bit expensive. There are TV and many delicious foods to eat. This is the best airlines I have travelled.
Not Verified ,Boeing 777 300ER,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Bangkok,July 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,"   Flight was great and comfortable seat layout was also great, Thai Airways has a 3-3-3 seat layout. I was impressed by the legroom! 32 inch (81 Cm), it gives a feeling that THAI actually cares about experience. Overall food was good. You had 2 options I had chicken with rise the other was mashed beteatos. Inflight entertainment was fine but could be updated. Cabin crew was Super friendly and hard working. Overall the flight was smooth as Silk!"
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Jakarta ,June 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,10,"  Bangkok Suvarnabhumi to Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta onboard their Boeing 787-9 on my second time taking TG433. Check-in at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi was relatively smooth sailing, but considering Thailand is known as the ""Land of Smiles"", I think the check-in agent could have been just a bit friendlier and more smiley. That being said, the rest of the ground staff members lived up to that title. Boarding was done late, and once I stepped onboard, I was welcomed by the fresh, clean, and comfortable cabin with wonderful mood lighting. The crews even set the light to do some rainbow-themed light show onboard. My seat, 57K, was very comfortable, user-friendly, and had plenty of features. The only possible drawback was that the seat slid forward when reclined, but for me, it wasn't a problem. The take-off was late, but afterwards, despite some turbulence, meal service commenced. There were two options: an omelet with chicken sausage and a chicken stew with rice and vegetables. I opted for the latter, which was presented nicely and tasted delicious. It reminded me of what I would usually have in some Asian restaurant. The In-Flight Entertainment was very responsive and had a customizable, beautiful layout. It wasn't too bad on the content side as well; however, more contents could have been added, especially the Western selections. The flight attendants of this flight truly lived up to the Royal Orchid branding. They were all hardworking, friendly, attentive, caring, and cheerful, although they were sometimes rushed when it came to explaining the menu. What I liked about them was that they strictly enforced the no-lavatory policy during turbulence but were also polite in enforcing it. The flight crews also gave the passengers enough time to prepare for the turbulence, with announcements warning passengers that a cloud-covered area was coming. They also put the seatbelt sign on long before the turbulence and everyone complied. There were a couple of passengers who, perhaps by an honest mistake, disregarded the sign, and the crews remained polite while staying firm. Landing was only a few minutes late, and the bag did take a considerable amount of time to arrive. Overall, this flight was better than my previous TG433 flight, and that Royal Orchid branding just keeps on blooming. This flight just strengthened my trust in them."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Bangkok to Tokyo,March 2024,,,,,,,2,no,3,"  Used to fly quite a lot with Thai and was always happy with their service. However, so far never had to cancel. This time wasn’t sure I will need that flight so bought a refundable fare. When trying to cancel, realized that the airline makes this specially difficult to do as there is no way to do it yourself online nor clear instructions how to do it. My emails were not answered. After finally getting through via the phone was told that it will take 180 days not including holidays and weekends to process the refund. 5 months on and still waiting for my money. Never again Thai Airways, this is not a way to treat your customers."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to London via Bangkok,June 2024,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,1,yes,7,"  First leg MEL to BKK on an A350-900. Food was OK, nothing special, but adequate. Lack of snacks and drinks though which is disappointing, liquids should be regularly provided on long hauls. Seat was very comfortable though which was nice, very good recline. Entertainment sub-par from a big airline like TA, I was disappointed, a lot of the films were unknown to me and not 'good' movies, TV shows were barely watchable. Quiet and comfy journey, polite staff, overall a good flight, no complaints. Two people had medical problems, fainting, which I think was due to the heat inside the plane, it was very hot in my opinion. Usually I wrap up because it gets cold with the AC, but I had to strip off and I was still dripping with sweat. Maybe they had an issue with the system. Second leg was on a 777-300, which had a random seat layout. I was in 49H which felt was obstructing the aisle, I was in front of the curtain and there was only just enough room for the trolley to get past. When I booked the flight there were only a few seats left, however, the plane was only half full, which meant many lucky passengers got rows to themselves. I'm frustrated at that because I only had 2 seat options for extra leg room as I have to have one due to my excessive height, yet there were many exit seats empty which had more space than my seat. The TV was all sticky and dirty, covered in coffee and tar which I had to clean myself. Barely any water or drinks handed out on the 12.5hr trip which is frustrating. Seat was comfy though, great recline, food was better than the first leg. There seemed to be a leak from the AC near my seat and a lot of water was running down the bulkhead. Quiet flight, same entertainment as the first leg (not uncommon), but overall a good trip. Staff were friendly and helpful, which I always expect from TA. I paid a lot for the return flight, as I had to book last minute, and due to the amount of empty seats I'm scoring it low on value for money, I feel mislead because of what I was shown as seat availability."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to London Heathrow via Bangkok,June 2024,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,4.0,4,no,3," Travelled with an 11 week old baby whom we were charged $700 for, and were not given a bassinet on either flight. The staff in Perth informed us that Thai sell the bulkhead seats as premium legroom, and if the seats are booked by others, babies don’t get accommodated. This is totally unacceptable and dangerous: new parents are generally sleep deprived anyway, and shouldn’t be expected to stay awake and alert whilst holding a baby for over 24 hours. The staff in Thailand confirmed this policy and despite no other babies being on the flight we had no bassinet. Even worse, if the bulkhead seats weren’t already booked, we would need to pay the premium for the legroom seats (over $170 each seat), if we want to avoid the danger of holding the baby for the 24 hours of flying. Unbelievable penny pinching that is putting babies’ safety at risk."
Not Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Bangkok to Delhi,June 2024,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1,no,2,  Flight delay reason given short connection…… never heard of this. Get your timings right so that all these passengers are not waiting because of your scheduling issues.
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Osaka-Kansai  to Bangkok,May 2024,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4.0,2,no,7,"  Our return flight from Osaka was quite different from the outbound that we recently reviewed. Online check-in was done, immigration & security procedures went well. We cannot comment on the lounge that much because time was short due to our delayed airport train arrival from an accident with injury along the route. Boarding & seating, again in 1-2-1 configuration were fine. Welcome drinks and lunch menu service were fine. I chose a Thai meal, and the request was well taken. But later on, when it comes to the main dish, I was told that it wasn't available! I thus have to choose the western dish which is a steak. The steak is overcooked (well done texture) but tender enough. A choice of very good Laugen roll makes the meal forgivable. Wine was good. The overall teamwork, attention, service mind are above average. Again, as in the previous review, inconsistencies among flights are among THAI weaknesses to be competitive with other Star Alliance partners serving similar routes."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Osaka-Kansai ,May 2024,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,4.0,3,no,6,"  After several attempts, we (my wife & I) finally are able to get our miles redeemed and booked this flight before our loads of miles will expire. Check-in, immigration, & security checks are efficient. The lounge F & B items are mediocre. BTW, some of the male toilets & urinals were out of order. Boarding was efficient and seating in 1-2-1 configuration is fine. I'd need to request for the welcome drink, we also need to remind an attendant for the meal choice after being inadvertent passed by, but the in-flight manager/purser later came in to politely apologise. I chose a Japanese course for the lunch, but unfortunately there was no Sake to complement it. Am I wrong about this observation? Thus, I requested for a Sauvignon Blanc but was given a Chardonnay! The Japanese choice was very good, but rice was quite dry on the top perhaps from over reheating. After meal, I requested for an Espresso but was told that it wasn't available because someone forgot to load it and I was then given a black coffee in lieu of it. IFE was fine. In all, we are not impressed with this flight, and it wasn't THAI that we used to have very good impression. The team wasn't synchronised nor consistent. THAI needs to recognise these points and improve them to be competitive with other Star Alliance carriers in the region which we used to fly, and they seem spotless in their services."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Tokyo Haneda,April 2024,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,"   We flew Thai Airways again, this time from Bangkok to Tokyo (Haneda). The check-in and boarding was smooth. The flight was on time and arrived Haneda a little earlier. The seat was comfy and had very good legroom. The cabin crew were nice and friendly and provided excellent service. The food was good though not so delicious. Overall, it was very good flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787,Family Leisure,Business Class,Kansai to Bangkok,May 2024,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,2,no,3, Thai Airways is no longer what it used to be. The poor crew try their best to offer a gracious service but there are many things lacking which makes this airline lag behind and lose its previous glory. The aircraft was dated and the IFE was an utter shame. Most of the controls were not working and games were not working either. No Wifi on the flight. There was 1 meal only for a 6-hour flight and all the items had pork in them making it so difficult for someone who is not a pork eater.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Denpasar to Bangkok,May 2024,5.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,no,1,"  I asked for something to drink like tea, coffee, coke during and after meal three times but not delivered. Asked for water twice and served. Pathetic experience."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Melbourne,May 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,"  This experience could hardly be faulted. The transit lounge in Bangkok was very comfortable with a good selection of food and drink. (We initially went to a mini-lounge called a ""tea room"". The toilets there weren't functioning so we decamped to a main lounge just a minute's walk away.) Boarding was orderly and the cabin crew's warm welcome set the tone for the rest of the flight. Our seats by the window were very comfortable, with adequate storage, and food and drink were brought frequently. The Thai dishes were particularly tasty. The plane arrived 10 minutes early and our bags emerged on the carousel just as we got there to pick them up. A perfect end to a long series of flights."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350 / Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Sydney to Mumbai via Bangkok,April 2024,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2,no,5,  I flew Sydney to Bangkok and everything went off smoothly. But the recliner from Bangkok to Mumbai was again broken. This is a repeat of last time and is so not acceptable. They gave me a 5500 baht as compensation. Not flying with these guys again.
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Heathrow,April 2024,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,no,1,"  30 mins into flight the screens went blank along the row of three seats. I brought this to the attention of a flight attendant in the galley area – who was irritated but did offer to have a look as soon as possible. Waited 30 mins – nobody came to look at the screens. I asked another flight attendant who looked at the screens and said “I’ll get them reset”. Waited another hour - nothing happened. Asked yet another flight attendant who said “they will be reset”. I asked how long this might take – a shrug was the response. Over the next hour we asked attendants twice more about the progress with no further information being forthcoming – we had lost faith in the ‘it’s being reset’ comment. Now 2 hours 30 mins into the flight a ‘minor manager’ arrived to offer us “compensation” – a choice of ‘2500 Thai air miles’ or $100 off our next Thai Air flight. We explained that this was not compensation because as we were unlikely to fly to Thailand again the offer had no value to us. We asked to speak to the ‘manager’. After another 30 minutes and now about 3 hours into the flight the ‘flight manager’ arrived and explained that no other offer of compensation was available, but, she would take my email address and we would be contacted after the flight via email with an offer of compensation. The flight manager apologised for the failure of the systems and said that she understood how disappointed and inconvenienced we were by the equipment failure – this was the first apology received. As of now, 21 April, five days after the flight no contact has been made to my email address. I would like to point out that all power to the systems in our row of three seats was off. Obviously, we had no access to any of the ‘provided’ films or other entertainment/information. As we had no power to the row of seats it was not possible to ‘call’ an attendant; so our contact was achieved by repeatedly moving through the cabin to find an attendant. We had no lights to read from. This was a problem as the passenger in the window seat was trying to sleep so had shut the window. This passenger was woken up and provided with an eye mask and then opened the window so that it was just possible to read, but with difficulty. There was no power to charge phones – so whilst I was able to watch my phone for a while, this became impossible later in the flight. There was no air ventilation from above and at times the space was very stuffy and uncomfortable because of this. We would also like to point out the poor communication with flight attendants. Until the ‘flight manager’ spoke to us three hours into the flight none of the attendants had apologised or shown any sympathy. I felt like I was an inconvenience to the attendant and found their manner short and off-hand. We did appreciate the apology of the ‘flight manager’ and the offer to reach out and contact us after the flight – it is a shame that this did not actually happen. We remain very disappointed in the lack of facilities available to us on the flight and the manner in which our concerns were dealt with by staff. It was without doubt the worst long haul flight we have experienced in many years of travelling."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Bangkok via New York,October 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Thai cancelled the flight and put the passengers through hell, not having a clear plan set up for hosting us at hotels, etc (I had to take my own cab to a hotel that eventually we heard about, an hour or so after waiting at luggage). Then I was put on another flight via Singapore. The flight was about Oct 10, 2023, and per EU regulations, Thai Air owed us compensation. They would bounce me around during calls & emails and finally said an office in the USA had to provide the compensation. It is now 19 April 2024, and I have yet to hear or receive anything from them. I will never book with Thai again and suggest you strongly consider other options yourself. Their flights may be cheaper than others, but you get what you pay for. In fact, you don't even get what you pay for at a lower price."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Turkey,March 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1,no,1," This was a codeshare flight with Turkish Airlines. We tried to book seats before departing Bangkok, and could not. My husband and I ended up in the middle seat of 3 seat plane - behind each other. We ordered vegetarian food, and got inedible vegan food. Obviously Thai Airways does not know the difference between vegetarian and vegan. Cabin crew practically non existent after serving food, staying at the back. Entertainment poor selection. No blanket on my seat - had to ask my husband as he was not using his for the overnight flight. No amenity kit provided. Would not recommend Thai Airways."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Chiang Mai via Bangkok,November 2024,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I had to reschedule a flight. It was impossible to do this online. Getting hold of anyone in customer services is an absolute nightmare. The phones are hopeless. If you search around online you may be lucky to get an email address that someone will answer. It wasn’t  as if this was a cheap ticket. If you need any kind of money back, including for a flight cancellation, then after they have helped themselves to a sizeable slice of your pie, you may wait months without any updates or contact. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangalore to Bangkok ,March 2024,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2,no,1,"  It took the airport 1 hour plus to attend to me after i had forgotten my cabin bag at security screening. Consequently I missed the flight and they would neither provide a refund or reroute me to the next flight. I reported the forgotten baggage to immigration desk at 7:50 PM and was attended to by the airport staff at 9 PM for a flight at 9:35 PM. I had 35 minutes to redo the security check, claim the forgotten luggage and take the airport train to the gate - an impossible feat to achieve!"
✅ Trip Verified ,B777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Frankfurt,February 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,10," We flew Thai Airways again. This time from Bangkok to Frankfurt round trip. The first leg was day flight which we enjoyed very good service. The check-in was smooth and the aircrew onboard were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed a nice meal and drink served with efficient and fast service. During flight we also had snacks i.e. sandwich, fruit and soft drink. The flight was smooth and we arrived a little early than schedule. The second leg back to Bangkok was night flight. The check in which serviced by Lufthansa staff had some problem with my seat which was changed unnoticed but this was solved before our boarding. The service by aircrew on board was excellent eventhough the flight was fully booked. The food was very good and tasty both dinner and breakfast. Of course the crew privide some snacks during the flight which we were very much appreciated. We arrived on time. Excellent flight and service."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Istanbul,March 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Passengers embarking on what should have been a routine journey with Thai Airways  found themselves stranded in a vortex of incompetence. With a delay stretching five hours, the airline failed to provide customer service beyond the instruction to wait in limbo.  Neither sustenance nor refreshments were offered. Highly do not recommend."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Melbourne,February 2024,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,3,yes,7, Poor cabin service and ignorant staff.

Unbelievably dishonest. Cannot trust them any more.
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,First Class,Bangkok to Tokyo Narita,January 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4,yes,10,"  Thai First Class provides excellent service. The flight attendants were just that, very attentive. Food was of superior quality. The seat is large and comfortable. There are only two rows of 4 seats each in this cabin. As this was a morning flight I didn't sleep. At the airport, one is attended by an airline employee from check-in, through immigration and on to the first class lounge."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Bangkok,January 2024,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4,yes,7,"  Check in was slow due to some disorganised passengers ahead of us and one person who kept pushing in the line. The Indian check in agent did her job, but there was no warmth or friendliness from her. Then one of our bags was put behind the check in desk while the others went down the belt. I had to insist firmly that the bag be put on the belt and I then watched it move on as far as I could.  Unfortunately boarding is run by Air India staff and I am so glad that I cancelled our original flight with them. Boarding was a shambles and once we got down to another jetbridge, Air India staff were waiting insisting on searching people's hand baggage. I was asked stupid questions like if i had any scissors, lighters etc - my reply was no, but these would have been picked up by security screening if they were in our bags. Finally we got to the aircraft and had the Thai crew in sight, what a relief to see some friendly faces. Once in our seats I made myself as comfortable as possible as I was not feeling well. Unfortunately the aircraft was stuck on the taxiway for about 20 minutes waiting to take off most likely due to the incompetence of Indian Air Traffic Controllers, but the crew did their best to keep us informed. I tried to sleep and did not eat any food offered to me, but my family said that it was inedible and they weren't sure what it was - certainly not food that would have come from Thailand. The seat was very uncomfortable - hard seat bottom and it did not recline, I had a sore back when we arrived in Bangkok 3 hours later. I was disappointed that the crew closed off the window shades so you couldn't look out the windows. There was a limited variety of inflight entertainment available, but adequate for a 3 hour flight - not enough for a long haul flight. On arrival, we got off the aircraft pretty quickly and as usual ... all of our bags were waiting for us by the time we arrived at the baggage belt. Back to the start - as I mentioned earlier, I insisted on staff putting my bag on the belt, not leaving it behind the counter. I assume that If I had just walked off, then that bag probably would not have made it past the counter - and a little surprise for anyone who would have opened it - my son had vomited over his clothes on the way to the airport and we put them in that bag before we went to the check in counter. Basically - make sure that all tags and bar code labels are removed from your bags before checking them in and make sure that you actually see your bags on the belt and moving down the belt before you leave the check in counter. This will reduce the risk of you losing your bags. We have gotten 3/4 of our way around the world so far and have not yet had any luggage go missing."

Very good hard product, perfect in time, efficient check-in, lovely, friendly, caring crew, even their entertainment system has changed from below to good average and food was really satisfying. Even my flight from MUC to BKK one month before and my flights to and from CNX were convincing and the prices were not cheap, but very fair. I definitely recommend them again. Well done!"

Thai Airways International (THAI) operated today's flight. The biggest change in the operation concerns the business-class food. Thai Smile used to give us a choice of 2 tasty Thai meals (often one with rice and one with noodles). On today's flight, THAI offered no choice. The meal was mediocre Western food: macaroni & chicken in a bland tomato sauce. The dessert was a nondescript cake with a few flakes of coconut on top, versus Thai Smile's usual offering of something that included a lot of fruit. Please bring back Thai food! Both Thais and foreigners like it! "

Basically they are lying, they are now an airline without any credibility. Service is random and all round gone downhill. Have used them and EVA many times along with BA on this leg and sadly as BA have pulled out Thai service is now at rock bottom, no better than a budget airline trading on past glory!"

I paid $485 for Business thinking it might be worth a more comfortable ride, even if it’s only an hour. Mistake. The economy and Business seats are exactly the same. Exactly. No privacy. No seat comfort. Nothing. It’s a total rip off. You are crammed together with people with smelly naked feet and your legs rammed against the seat in front listening to people broadcasting soap operas from their phone. What a joke. I’d ask for a refund but Thai Air probably couldn’t even manage that. My advice: just fly economy and save yourself $300. Obviously, I should have known."

The flight TG404 was full from Singapore & arrived 20 minutes late from Thailand & left 20 minutes late but arrived 10 minutes late only at Suvarnabhumi Airport. Service was a bit slow at start but Cabin crew was able to serve all passengers & clear the cabin in the short time of the flight. Unlike in the past, there was no drinks offered first but instead the Meal was served followed by drinks! Seems most airlines are doing this these days. We are Vegetarians & had ordered AVML meals on both flights. The meals were loaded in Bangkok itself & was in general satisfactory. However both meals to & from Bangkok were identical, AVML meals are normally served with Plain Yoghurt, but this was lacking. The toilets were clean & adequate. The aircraft seemed a shade Old but was clean & well maintained. Overall journey by Thai Airways was satisfactory."

Travelled with my wife on this airline for our second time and although we had a bad flight with them first time we did not review and decided to give them another chance, a regrettable mistake! The seats were cramped together with minimum leg room on this A350-900, there was a three seat configuration across this narrow jet giving just about enough room on the aisles to squeeze the service trolley through. Throughout the nine hour flight, just two service appearances by the staff. There was no pre dinner beverages served, the food was practically inedible with limited choices and  hot and spicy. I have had back surgery in the past and in order to relieve the pain and discomfort of the cramped space I decided to stand up for a while adjacent to toilet area and was soon reprimanded by a rude air steward and told to return to my seat even though the seat belt sign was not on. The management of this airline really need to monitor the poor and unacceptable standards of their air crew and implement some in service training for them. This is my second overnight flight with Thai airways and it appears that their in flight crew sleep better than their paying customers! I will never fly with Thai airways again!"

When this occurs it is obvious that the repair will take long hours but the pilot decided to stall us inside the airplane for an hour or more. The flight is now further delayed when we could have boarded right after the pilot identified the problem. Thai airways did not bother to compensate nor even provide the passengers with refreshments and we were assigned to board the plane following a bus ride.  I will never travel Thai Airways again.  How are you going to compensate me the two hours I lost. Okay they gave refreshments before boarding, I don’t understand why before boarding? "

We waited for 12 hours to be rescheduled without food or water! We received a measly compensation of lounge use that too 4 hours before our departure which was at night! So during the day I had to wander around trying to find a space to sleep comfortably. Extremely appalling service! Would never recommend."

I have reserved three seats prior to flight but very disappointed to know during boarding that they have changed my seats when asked the reason staff said that seats are not reclining, very sad to check during flight that other passengers were sitting there comfortably without any issues. Moreover, staff was not very friendly who interact with us. Food was worse as well. Only thing I like was the timing, flights were on time."

There is no law that we should do this. This time we will do but even if you are pregnant there is no law that tells to help a pregnant person put the luggage on shelf. Both the staffs were so rude and he shouted in front of whole passengers. The law says not to help a pregnant woman travelling alone but what about moral ethics? If your own mother travels with luggage won’t you expect there would be someone to help her on her way? Totally disappointed and upset. Will never travel in Thai airways again

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Bangkok,July 2023,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1,no,2," Thai Airways used technology to replace various in flight and check in services without a correction/verification feature or providing human support for their technical error. Countless attempted contacts were made via phone calls and emails minutes after error was spotted, everyday for 2 consecutive weeks before trip took place. Assumed that I would be in the safe hand, but no, I was charged extra for no service provided and being held hostage for more payment at the airport check in counter by Thai airways operators. As Thai Airways operators claimed, they are not from the same department, they cannot offer a resolution, they do not know their system, and most unexpectedly they claimed they are not employees of Thai Airways! After hearing these from them, all I thought was to get out of that place immediately and never use them again. I made another payment again, repacked baggage, and dashed through the security clearance check points and the airport to my boarding with less than 1 hour as that operator held hostage to my check in bags. In all reasonable manners, airport manager was not empowered enough to manage the situation and their operators emotions; implemented technology should be well learned and supported if any system restrictions by the operators - obnoxious resistance result to failed implementation; and all passengers should be extended with a peace of mind in traveling, not being expected to pacify it's frustrating employees and dealt with their illiterate knowledge of its own system, and be able to answer why charging passenger when service was not provided to avoid the dispute and stay effective. I will avoid using Thai airways till a positive change observed. Unfortunately, from worse to catastrophic experience this time."

Above all the boarding staff were very rude when asked for the guidance. I wonder the way the staff yelled to go and stand in the line as if they are offering any free services! I really felt humiliated by the way I got treated. I wish the airlines will teach your staff to treat the passengers politely and with the deserved respect. In addition that how can the cabin crew forgot to provide life jacket for the infant in case of any emergency landing, thankfully nothing kind of that happened! Hope your airlines provide smooth journey experience next time. Looking forward for positive changes! "

Boeing 777. Positives: Received 3 meals over 2 flights and all the food was delicious especially the rice. This was as a surprise as didn’t have high expectations for their food. However their was a vegan passenger next to me who was only served fruit the whole flight. Negatives: The seat was uncomfortable and hard with no leg rest but can recline the chair. The cabin crew were no longer in their traditional Thai outfits. They were not that friendly but were present throughout the flight. The ground staff at Bangkok, were not up to the ""Land of Smiles"" name, and the crews seemed to lack friendliness although they remained professional and efficient. Didn’t use wifi on both flights so cannot comment on their connectivity. Cannot comment also on the in flight entertainment but no doubt there would have been choice.

The Tokyo-Bangkok leg was sublime: the crews, in Thai traditional uniforms, treated us like they were happy to have all passengers onboard this very special occasion. They were friendly, professional, and always present throughout the flight. The seat was comfortable, but they could have added some extra legroom since my leg touched the seat in front of me when sleeping in a relaxed/reclined position, and for the record, I am only 5 ft 6. Ground staff at Haneda were friendly and professional, as well. The positive trend was continued by the IFE system and the food I received on the flight. Not only did I receive two meals, but they were absolutely exquisite, although their rice could use a tad more seasoning to make it perfect. The IFE system on the A330 contained more selections than their 777s, with the same, good level of responsiveness and excellent layout. It was the Bangkok-Jakarta leg that brought the scores down a little bit. The ground staff at Bangkok, as usual, were not up to the ""Land of Smiles"" name, the crews seemed to lack friendliness although they remained professional and efficient, the seats were a tad too hard although had better legroom, and the in-flight entertainment was an old model that lacked responsiveness and often hung and crashed, although it had good selections and layout. The meal served on this flight, however, were just as delicious as my previous 3 Thai flights. Overall, in these two anniversary-edition flights, there were some downsides that need improvement, especially on the Bangkok-Jakarta leg, but the Thai touch has not completely vanished. I can see that they're slowly but surely going back to its former glory."

I was originally sceptical about this airline, but after trying these two flights, I was genuinely surprised by their service. The crews were absolutely friendly and one of them even went the extra mile to help me take pictures. Ground service at Jakarta and Narita was also fast, efficient, and friendly, but the ground staff at Bangkok were a disgrace to Thai's ""Land of Smiles"" label, hence bringing the rating down one star. Seat-wise, the Jakarta-Bangkok leg had the more comfortable seat, while the Bangkok-Narita one was on the inferior side, although it had a footrest installed. Meals on both legs were delicious beyond belief, and for the Bangkok-Narita leg, I was served two meals instead of just one that many carriers do nowadays. Their In-Flight Entertainment system was superb in terms of responsiveness, contents, and layout, although the IFE on the Bangkok-Narita leg was a tad laggy due to the age of the system. Face masks, at the time of my flight, were no longer mandatory. I used to be sceptical of Thai due to the recent reviews, but it turns out that they brought me a surprise of my life. Will definitely try them again. They are an absolute star!"

I specifically purchased a seat with extra legroom as I was traveling with an infant and needed a bassinet. My partner sat behind me. I was informed that I would not be provided a bassinet even though my child met the size requirements because they were 8 months old and not 6 months old. I was stuck in my seat with my baby and unable to even eat. The flight attendant was very rude and told us that if my partner wanted to sit in the empty seat next to me, he would have to pay $120 AUD for a paid seat. I would not have even purchased this seat if I knew I would not be provided a bassinet. As an alternative, the flight attendant offered us worse seats in the back rows, where my partner would also be seated separately. I had an inflatable bed for the baby, which the flight attendant also did not allow me to use. My child had to sit for 9 hours despite not even being able to sit yet and now has a distorted silhouette. I regret purchasing another premium economy flight with this airline before this experience, as it was the worst flight and airline experience of my life, and I will be pursuing legal action. Avoid this airline at all costs!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,denpasar to Karachi via Bangkok,April 2023,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Worst customer service of any airline I’ve flown. I booked a changeable ticket but when trying to change it, Thai Airways is making me jump through so many hoops my head is spinning! First, you cannot change online. You must email customer service. Customer service emails you after at least a day saying that you must contact the ticket office of your original destination. No working phone numbers for any ticket offices on their website or Google. The originating ticket office gave me a Thailand phone number to call (no toll free). They finally changed my ticket but said I would receive and email “a couple of days before departure “ to make a payment. The email arrived early in my spam folder and the link expired. I spent an hour on the phone requesting a new link. It took more than 24 hours for them to send a new link (because customer service and the ticketing department are separate and you cannot contact ticketing directly). I finally received the new link, but it’s rejecting every possible card I have and my family has. We’ve tried Visa card, Mastercard, and debit cards from 3 different banks in different names. All are rejected. The banks say no fraud alert has been triggered, the problem is with the merchant. Thai Airways refuses to take responsibility for their antiquated system and terrible technology. My flight leaves in 12 hours and I still don’t have a confirmed ticket! I will never fly Thai again."

Boarding needs to be more understandable. The Cabin Crew were outstanding on Customer Service, very polite, friendly. nothing was too much trouble for them, they all worked hard. Food was average, seats were a bit tight pitch, although it is new Aeroplane so I thought there would be more space with a 3x3x3 seat configuration as others Airlines 777 can have 3x4x3 seat configuration. At first the cabin was too hot, no personal A/C to adjust, not comfortable but later in the flight Aircon is better. The Inflight Entertainment was touch screen and very responsive but the content was average, music needs updating. I probably would not fly this direct flight again with Thai Air, better to use an Airline that stops halfway, you can stretch your legs have a break from flying at a Hub and get on another flight for the second part of the journey in my opinion but I thought I would give it a try to see the difference. The price for Thai Air is bit high for what you actually get. Date of experience: 31 March 2023."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to London Heathrow,March 2023,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,2,no,5,"  Check in was fine. Plane was clean and economy seating, fine. In flight entertainment was weak, films listed under New Releases were certainly not at all new. The visual images were poor - like a video that had been copied many times. The interface was very slow to respond. Staff pretty disengaged. Worst aspect was the food. Really bad. 2 hot meals were served but were mirror images of each other - chicken with rice or ‘seafood’ pasta (just prawns) for meal 1, then what looked suspiciously same ‘seafood’ recipe with rice or the same chicken recipe with pasta for 2nd meal, both with a tasteless piece of cake for pudding. Linguini in tomato sauce isn’t the ideal pasta to eat in the confined space of economy in a white t-shirt! Anyway, as the sauces was totally bland and uninteresting I didn’t bother to try. Chicken was thigh meat that hadn’t been cleared of pieces of bone. For the second meal the starter was prawns (prawn followed by prawn?) but the prawns were still frozen - returned to the staff and did not take them up on the offer of a replacement. Managed to avoid any tummy troubles touring around Vietnam - sadly, not the same when I got home after this flight. Food can make or break the experience of having to sit through a 16 hour flight. It broke mine. After the second meal, which was served half way through the flight, the staff handed out a round of sandwiches in ready sliced ‘plastic bread’ containing half a round of cheese, the other ‘ham’. There was no other filling and looked like they had been rescued from the bottom of a teenagers school bag. I could see that many people hadn’t eaten their main course. Later in the flight I did obtain a nice banana and some cashew nuts from the galley to keep me going. Flew to Asia with Vietnam Airlines - considerably better. Will avoid Thai in future."

Ground staff announced passengers in certain row to board, then failed to give anymore information so all started boarding - it was easy to board no queue. I found the flight too hot for half of the 11 hr flight in row 51.  The seat was uncomfortable and a upholstery was bit dated on this 10 yr old 777. There was no personal airvent to control. Food was not great and there was no menu either, only one choice of dish. Breakfast was not great either, lukewarm and uninspiring. The Inflight Entertainment was average.

Nothing was any different except baggage allowance & change ticket fees. Seats, food etc were the very same this was very disappointing. Anyway for our return flight my wife suggested that we change our seats to a bulk head in front because of more leg room. Although we paid through the nose they still wanted another GBP 78.80 each. I contacted Thai Airways about this on January 25th as I write February 26th no reply. I would advise anyone do not fly Thai because the service is second rate and prices are high."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,London to Bangkok,February 2023,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3,no,6,"  From great to not so good. The main issues have to do with communication. I've sent several emails, and not one has been followed up. This is especially bad because there is no one to phone in the UK. I tried calling Thailand and waited 20 minutes on international hold. When I tried to talk about the issue at the airport, they referred me to email & phone. Pretty bad. And beware, when changing your flight, you will need to pay the cost to change your flight (of course). Plus, if you paid for a seat upgrade, you will not get the original upgrade cost back when you change flights, so you will have to pay twice. It doesn't say that anywhere I could find, and no one will reply to emails or answer the phone."

Since we were ROP gold members, we could use the priority counter, which has been relocated to row H at Suvarnabhumi airport, it used to be at row B. Check in was smooth, & since we were flying to Japan, the agent asked if we had filled out Japan Pass - which made us clear immigration and customs really quickly in Nagoya. During the evening, The Royal Orchid Prestige lounge was extremely crowded, however we did find a corner to ourselves far from the main food area, but close to the bar & Halal food area which had fewer options. There was more than enough food and we weren't hungry when the flight took off - so we could get more sleep. I also used a shower suite, where L'occitane liquid soap and shampoo were provided. Boarding was an absolute mess, the crew was late & some passengers did not get their documents properly checked. This was made worse by the fact that gate C1 had very little seating, and lots of passengers ended up sitting on the floor waiting for boarding. We had paid extra to get extra-legroom seats (about 50 USD each) and they were worth it. The purser suggested that I move to the empty exit row seats in the second cabin so that my mum and brother could have a bit more space and comfort. This made the flight much more comfortable for them. I hate short overnight flights, and a departure time of 00:05 wasn't great - no alternatives either. Most of the passengers were asleep before the flight even took off, but I had stayed awake to get a bloody mary from the crew - who bought me one from the galley. Pre-pandemic, Thai Airways had a policy that they would have to serve their gold frequent fliers first. I am very glad that they kept this policy & I was asked whether I would like Omelette with sausage or Shrimp Pad Thai. I chose the Shrimp Pad Thai - which was very tasty & flavourful. I jokingly asked if I could get a cappuccino - which is normally only available for business class passengers. The FA said that she would try to get one for me - which she did, & I asked to be woken up for the meal service. 2 hours prior to landing in Nagoya after some tossing and turning, I was politely awoken & had my breakfast placed on my tray. The crew were all very nice on both flights. On the return flight we flew out from Sapporo/Chitose. The contract lounge in Sapporo had little in the way of amenities or food. Boarding was much better organised on this flight, and we had our meal orders taken after being seated, stewed chicken with mash potatoes or spicy fish curry with rice. I tasted both on this flight and both were very tasty, albeit the fish used is pangas, which isn't that great. Thai used to serve seabass which tastes much better. The highlight of the meal was the cake - a simple vanilla sponge but really tasty. Before landing we were served a spinach pie, which was also tasty but I would've preferred chicken. There was a small issue I had with the crew, on this flight, I found out the tray table wasn't clean when I looked at it during boarding, & the purser walked through & told me to close it for departure - but I pointed out the wet table to her & she called one of the FAs to wipe it up. Entertainment is slightly lacking - they could do with a few more films. Thai is still a great carrier, maybe not as great as the pre-pandemic Thai Airways, I feel like they're 90% of what they used to be in 2019."

When I spoke with the Thai airways representative he agreed it was high but wasn’t able to help. I’m thankful we looked into this before as we were planning to bring an additional suitcase and pay at the airport, which apparently is closer to 60 pounds per kg. Anyone flying Thai Airways be very wary of packing additional weight."

We are still not sure on the process to book the bassinet seat and on based on what priority it can be booked. We are travelling with a 9 month old and we will have to sit with infant through out the flight. I know few airlines which provide bassinet for babies until 1 year old. We checked with customer care on the process to book the front row seat with leg space during our flight to Bangkok and they advised us to speak at the counter. At the counter they say the flight is full and asked us call and book before the flight. We somehow managed travelling to Bangkok which is a 9 hour flight with baby in our lap. We had some trouble when people In front of us push their seat back. On our return flight, we checked with them. Please note we consistently called them, no response, mailed them no response. We rang them again and the officer said she cannot book online and we call them some hours before. We did call and still we didn't get the seat. The lady in the counter said we should call and talk. End of story we didn't get seat and no staff is able to direct us on the process to book this seat. In Thai Airways only infants below 6 months can avail the facility of bassinet. I am not sure I saw babies or parents with babies in that seat. In some place they say if we pay we can get the seat. We are pretty disappointed with the service and expect parents with babies or toddlers (under 2 years get some preferences with regards to seat). "

After so many negative comments about food and service, I wanted to show my satisfaction and my gratitude for a good flight. I arrived at CDG Terminal 2E before 09:00 am, and to my surprise the check-in counters were open very early. CDG Terminal 2E is not my favorite Terminal in Paris, Thai Airways may moved back to the iconic Terminal 1 later, but at the present time they are still using the Air France Terminal. Check-in was fast, passport controls was easy, but the security lanes took over 30 minutes. Boarding was on time and efficient.  The return journey to Bangkok was full in Business class and Economy class. The cabin crew in my section were super attentive and very responsive to my demand. I was given a a written menu, not the same as the old Business class menu, but it is a step into a better direction. The catering from Paris was excellent and very tasty and portions were very large. I ordered the Thai dish. Mid-flight the cabin crews came around and served some Thai chocolate ice-cream, a nice touch. In the galley, drinks and snacks were available. The restroom were kept clean during the flight. I was pleased by the service provided and glad to experience the Royal Orchid Service that I knew. They are making an effort to improve their inflight service. If there is one area of improvement is IFE with more movies and more music. Thank you for a memorable return flight."

There was not a single seat left. The flight was punctual but what I wish to comment on was the friendliness and hard work of the cabin crew who never stopped working throughout the 10 hours of the flight. I went for regular walks and coffee pick me ups and they were always polite and helpful also to the many passengers who required attention. I enjoyed the meals and having travelled with other European carriers I can say that these crews are really on top of the game. In economy we obviously do not enjoy the perks of higher classes of seats. However the personal service was of the same high standard.

Attentive crew, more likely to be found with Thai on Asian flights than to Europe. Regrettably the quality of food has gone with Thai in the complete wrong direction. However, as prices of tickets are going up, and being a customer, I will start to look now for what really gives me value for money. No problem to get less if I pay less, but if I pay, even in Economy I want something and not what Thai currently delivers. I will be avoiding them."

The staff were fantastic and attentive. A menu was provided and the food, in particular the duck with curry sauce was lovely. We got 2 meals. The cabin was dimmed after the meal to allow people to sleep - this daytime route is always tricky in that you end up effectively having a 31 hour day. The films weren’t particularly great although I found a couple to watch and there was nothing like live TV or sport which some airlines provide. Toilets were kept clean throughout the flight. The hard product was ok, full flat bed, it pays to understand the alternate arrangement of seats close together or wide apart in the middle pair and aisle or window biased on the single outer seats. It’s not the best out there but it isnt the worst either. Pricing is relatively expensive at the moment. I’d say the EVA hard product feels newer and fresher but the Thai Air staff work hard to level the field."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bengaluru to Luang Prabang via Bangkok,December 2022,1.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,3,"  Definitely not flying with the airline again.  I was unable to purchase my flight tickets directly from the airline as they would not accept any of my cards. I had to resort to booking via a third party website, which meant that I could not choose a weight of my luggage. Before check-in, I tried to purchase extra weight online with my booking reference number but I was unable to do so, not even during the online check-in, so I was okay with paying kore at the airport. At Bengaluru airport, I have been told that I am unable to make a payment by card nor cash, only UPI form of payment was possible. For that though, I would need an Indian bank account. I found it ridiculous…how can they offer just this form of payment on an international flight with international travellers. Thankfully, I have friends in India who were willing to make the payment for me but what about the others? Honestly, there is zero logic! Also, it took the staff to calculate the price like 10minutes…Oh and my receipt stipulated that I paid in cash. I honestly don’t know what would happen if I could not make the payment. Thai Airways is way too problematic for me and will try to avoid it at all costs in the future. But i have to say that the staff during the flight were nice and helpful. I don’t have anything negative to say about the service provided. However, it was a night flight so most of the passengers were sleeping. Also want to point out that seats were extremely uncomfortable and I was unable to sleep well. Thai Smile Airways, a budget airline under Thai Airways, was much better in terms of comfort."

Food out of Frankfurt very bad (seems to be a problem in eco with many Asian airlines flying out of there). The flight attendant in my sector wasn’t very responsive at the beginning of the flight (it took 30 mins to get a drink after food was handed out) but eventually “we warmed up” and finally got all I could ask for.

However our new tickets now have a layover in Bangkok for close to 2 hours (Which is the total flight time in the first place) Our only option is only to cancel the flight. But since this change came so late it was not possible to book other tickets. We asked to somehow be compensated, but the message was clear: even though we have made your trip significantly longer, we are unable to meet anyone of your requests. I find it very unsatisfactory that an airline have the power to just don't care about their customers, and refuse to help in any way.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phuket to Hong Kong via Bangkok,October 2022,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  On the 20th Oct I was checked in by ground staff, who was rude and uneducated about the updated vaccine policy for Hong Kong residents, for whom we don't need any vaccination proof to fly to Hong Kong, other than a health declaration of the negative RAT test result and a HK health department QR code for flight. But when confronted, this staff joined his supervisor together to claim that they confirm they won't be allowed to process issuing my connecting flight (TG638) from Bangkok to Hong Kong, unless I have a HK vaccination proof record. So they only issue the HKT-BKK ticket and insist I can confront with the ground staff at Bangkok if I am allowed to board my connecting flight in BKK (just one hour 5 minutes connecting time there). I got stranded in BKK due to the lack of this connecting flight boarding pass. When confronted at BKK Thai Airways ticket office, it took me some time to argue with the Manager of the Thai Smile Phuket Ground Staff to confirm it was their mistake and lack of updated information and following up. At last, I wasted another 6 hours in BKK and took another airline back home."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Copenhagen via Bangkok,June 2022,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,1,"  As my flight was when Thailand was in lockdown i tried to find information on what to do in Bangkok as we were stopping there, I tried finding information and I tried contacting Thai airways before leaving. Absolutely impossible. They never answer to emails and they never picked up the phone after dozens of attempts. Luckily if you're a bit savvy you can find the website. But for the layman, good luck, because Thai airways ain't gonna help you. We took 4 flights with Thai in total. Out of those, my seat was broken on two of them. When I let the onboard crew know, it was like I was speaking gibberish. No care factor at all.  Credit where credit is due, at least some of the crew were very nice and accommodating. During our flight back, my bag was absolutely smashed. It was peeling all over the place and a wheel had been knocked off. As well as my wife's brand new bag was also scratched to within an inch of its life. Unfortunately we made the mistake of not properly inspecting them before going to security at Sydney airport. Because it didn't matter however much I tried to contact Thai airways afterwards, they're just as impossible to contact. I even filled out their online form the day after. And when I finally got in contact with the Thai airways cargo email at Sydney airport I got to talk to someone. Regardless, just as fruitless as everything else with Thai airways so far. Claimed that I hadn't filled out the form and that I was out of luck. So essentially, because they're having whatever issues with their shitty website, that's my fault and my bag won't get fixed. Flying is usually never fun. But this experience has been the worst I've ever had by far. And the worst part? I would've come back,  if they had just replaced my $100 bag. But Thai would rather lose two customers permanently. Couldn't recommend them."

Boarding: security took half an hour but after it boarding seemed organised and it was smooth! Seat was very comfortable and a large amount of legroom. Add this with a 333 Config and an adjustable headrest and recline, it was very good for Economy class. Staff were very friendly and were greeting people nicely. Food was tender and delicious, probably one of the best economy meals I had ever had in a flight. IFE: Fair enough. The system was smooth and straightforward, but it had less shows and music on average compared with other airlines. Thai offered charged Wi-Fi at reasonable prices. Was fast enough for browsing or streaming. Definitely recommend!"

Friendly welcome, seat was standard business with pillow, blanket and amenity kit with slippers. Unfortunately, there were no pajamas. In the side socket were the earphones. There was no inflight magazine due to covid. Also there was no Menu but the crew came and explains what they can prepare for us and I made my selection. I asked for wine list but she said she will present them to me with the carriage. After while another member of the crew came with the warm towel. IFE was good, screen is big enough and the selection of the movies was a little outdated. There was no wifi option (due to aircraft?) After departure, service started. First arrived the nuts with appetizes and champagne. Then the first plate was a macaroni salad with chicken. My main dish was served which I had selected fish and she presented me the wines. I picked red (because I like, should pick white with fish). Two members of the crew came to bring the fruit with cheeses and I had to pick a red strong wine. Finally dessert with coffee and brandy was served. After that had to check the lavatory and get ready for nap. By the time I returned, my seat was turned to a bed and bedding was set for me. A bottle of water arrived to follow me to sleep. I played with the IFE and soon I was snoozed. One hour before arrival they start awakening the passengers to ready them for the second serving. It was tasty with flavor of Thailand. Another warm towel arrived and we were ready for landing. Everything was pleasant and relaxing. Great service. Excellent crew."

Pleasant experience with nice and clean Boeing 777. Seat had a decent legroom and the seating part was moving forward giving you an extra reclining feeling. Very comfortable, on the seat was a blanket and earphones, NO pillow. Pity they do not have inflight magazine due to covid, (same excuse to save money and weight, a lot of airlines are using the same excuse). IFE was good but a little outdated selection of movies. I found a couple movies to keep me busy. No welcome drink offered. After takeoff service started (two option) which was tasty with selection of wine, beer and drinks. No ice-cream for desert. During flight the crew was passing by with little bottles of water for the passengers. At the galley there were some sandwiches and drinks during the flight. No amenity kit and at the WC were toothbrushes and hand cream. One hour before landing the second meal was served also two options. Pleasant experience but could be better."

We arrive at the airport check in, through fast track as we are flying business, all pretty uneventful as you would expect on a premium ticket. We are flying from gate C8 and follow the signs to the Thai lounge at C Gates, a 600m walk, to find they are closed, so we walk the return journey 600m back to the lounge we passed 10 - 15 mins before, that is open at D gates. We ask why we weren’t told by the check in staff that only the lounge at D gates is open; apparently it has been shut for ages and they keep asking the check in staff to tell passengers but they don’t! Anyone at Thai airways heard of a sign? Simple 5 minute job! By the way lovely lounge, but the same awful TG service. Nothing changes. We then get to the gate to see a queue 50m long to board, no priority line for Business class passengers. Apparently they call them on first and then it is a free for all… So the business class passengers lucky enough to have made it to the lounge, who don’t arrive to be at the head of the queue wait in line, or have to push themselves to the front - embarrassing and awkward for them/us nothing changes! Beautiful lounge TG but nothing changes, still the same old awful service, lack of thought and care for your passengers! How can you still get it so wrong?"

The service in the Y class is kept to the bare minimum, cost cutting was apparent too in the catering area. However, they do still maintain good standards in service, and meal were decent enough despite smaller portion, on plastic cutlery. As a star alliance gold member, priority boarding, luggage delivery and excess luggage allowance were all delivered. Overall, it's still a good experience in their short haul flights, anything less than 3 hours."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Copenhagen to Bangkok,September 2022,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,2.0,2,no,2,"  Another airline whose reputation from the past is fading. The flight from Copenhagen to Bangkok was canceled shortly before boarding. Unfortunately, the passengers were not rebooked on other flights, but had to spend the night in a hotel in Copenhagen. The issue of vouchers for transfer and hotel accommodation was very chaotic. The flight was then operated again the next day with 1 hour delay to the scheduled departure time. Cabin crew was friendly but all other assets were below par. For example, there were no menus in business class, the amendment kit had very basic content, the IFE offered little selection of current films, liquid residue from the predecessor was still stuck to the side wall and the seat was already showing signs of wear. There was also no Wifi available. The food was all served on a tray with no tablecloth and the quality of the food was average. Gone are the days at Thai, when there was an orchid for every passenger and everything was done with a smile. Too bad. I will certainly not book business class with Thai in the near future."

Another male cabin crew was supposed to pass my bf the chicken rice, after the food was served my bf waited for a long time until another side of the crew was asking and passed to my bf instead. He did not apologise and ignored at least for any follow up and empathy for passengers. This is no customer service and low quality of cabin crew. "

At the airport, the counters were poorly organized, the worst part was the time of the registration. It took me more than two hours to register. In the end, when I was at the counter, the attendant told me I had to pay for my 6-8kg of extra luggage - almost 500$. I could not buy extra luggage online because it is down on the website if you don't fly domestically in Thailand. Also, I'm Russian, we don't have any working VISA and MasterCard cards anymore. We cannot pay for extra. The attendant did not propose I rearrange the luggage or reduce the amount of extra luggage. It was already almost 30 minutes to boarding - the attendants held me there. So, I had to pay to be able to board the plane - there was a very long line for the passport check. The flight itself was fine. Flight attendants were polite and provided me with sufficient help due to my situation. However I do not recommend Thai Airways, especially flying from India. They will take your money, and force you to exchange for rupees; the amount is ridiculous - I have never paid that much for the overweight. The amount should be reasonable. Also, the attendants should provide options for what to do in this situation and should not keep you at the counter when the boarding is almost on. I saw no politeness, no hospitality, no respect that day from Thai Airways at the airport. Also, I have filed a claim on the official website explaining everything in details - no response at all. As if I spoke to the thin air."

I don’t know if they were working with reduced staff? I would understand that dip in quality if that was the case but we are not travellers that press the buzzer (ever). We were not offered a drink with our meals, not offered tea or coffee except for once the entire flight. Meals were handed out with bottled water and that was the extent of it. I noticed the row in front and behind were offered beverages but this happened at every service that were not offered any beverages. It’s just a long way to go if they “forget” to serve you as it would seem in our case."

We had booked 2 seats together only to find out that the seat booking had been changed due to 4 business class seats being broken, so we sat behind each other. The plane was so old and even my seat had problems reclining. There was a time when getting on board you were greeted with a smile and champagne. It seems that the Thai staff have been told not to offer anything to customers - the air hostess made an excuse that due to COVID that we could no longer have champagne until after take off. Throughout the trip the staff were hiding, and very rarely came round to offer any snacks, drinks unless asked! Overall it seems that the staff are unmotivated and embarrassed by the state of Thai Airways. Thai seems to be in a very sad state - I have been a loyal customer for decades - now will be looking at Finnair and Emirates."

Insufficient information about this - a simple e-mail with all flight details - would not have seen the change, I only noticed it because of the ""GoTo app"" - as a result I had to stay in Bangkok for 13 hours - you also have to take care of the compensation yourself - everything very annoying.  Nicht mehr so toll. Hatte Flug mit Umsteigen - der 1. Flug (vom Rückflug) wurde um 11 !!! Stunden nach vorn verlegt.

The flight attendants were polite and friendly and the flight was on time. My bags were misplaced and arrived two days after I arrived. This is not a huge issue and apart from misplacing the bags in the first place, the service provided to have my bags located and delivered was reasonable. However the customer service after this was appalling. I quite simply required confirmation from the airline that my luggage was delayed so I could make an insurance claim. I sent over 10 emails and made over 15 phone calls (6 hours on hold) without receiving a single emails back and after having the line cut after being on hold multiple times. When I reached out on their facebook page I received a nasty response via the messenger app accusing me of 'spaming' them. All phone numbers they provided either rang out or went on hold and were eventually disconnected without anyone picking up. It has been 4 months and I still have not heard a thing from them."

I think these sort of things need to be sorted out. I realise Thai Airways are struggling at the moment but basic easy to fix issues like this should not happen. Entertainment system onboard has very limited selection but after all said and done you are there for travel not going to cinema. Hopefully this will improve. The aircraft are looking very tired and could do with a good spit and polish inside. Basically the standard is a fair way below pre pandemic times. Needs investment so it can fairly represent beautiful Thailand."

I can say there is no consistency with their product. Every flight has been completely different. For example all the other flights you had wine with your meal then a drink afterwards. Although they had wine on the trolley they wouldn’t let you have a glass. This time you was allowed a maximum of 2 beers. Which for a 12 hour it’s rather stringent. I found the flight attendants to be unfriendly and not willing to help. Food quality was ok. Movie choice not great. Still the direct route is convenient.

We weren't surprised but still disappointed by the poor standard of food served and by the little things such as packaged towelettes instead of real hot or cold towels. It seems a miracle that the airline is still able to operate. The IFE wasn't too bad especially if you're not a regular cinema goer. Dune was a welcome addition but the line hasn't changed much over the last few years. The service by the cabin crew was excellent as always. The BKK to CDG leg had the new seat configuration where everyone is at an angle. The seat is much harder but on this flight a mattress was provided. I think I prefer the other seat type. The business class lounge at BKK was disappointing. Our flight to CDG left at midnight leaving us with a 7 hour transit. No showers were available then or 7 weeks later! The chairs were comfy for a few hours but not for a long stopover. The food options however were far better than the inflight catering. There was no business class lounge available at CDG due to renovations but I suspect it's another cost cutting measure like the soft drinks only policy prior to take off and alcohol served only during meals. Our main complaint was the number of changes made to our original post Covid booking and the terrible customer service from their Sydney office. Numerous unanswered phone calls, messages and emails."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Bangkok,May 2022,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,1,no,2," London to Bangkok. I traveled with my wife who is Thai, I am British. Firstly I made a mistake with my booking and I understand that that was my fault but I was charged heavily. What was more frustrating was that I could not contact the airline personally by email as they did not respond. The telephone number supplied did not work either. To top that off my THAI wife got allocated 30kg of Luggage and me 20kg? We were sat together and checked in together and the check in staff just shrugged their shoulders and said ""We have no control over that"". I usually fly Korean Air (recommend) but this was my first of many trips to Thailand so I thought I would fly with the National carrier. Never again. No wonder they are going under when they need customers post covid I will say that the onboard staff were great though. The company is letting them down."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Manila via Bangkok,May 2022,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,4.0,2,no,1,"  Cannot contact them by phone for rebooking; you have to do it by email (UK) -- I have done this several times and sometimes they reply after 48 hours but sometimes it takes them 5 days. They have a phone number for their Manila operations but you only get a recorded message; their Manila airport number, which the recorded message said you could call on certain days, just kept ringing. I even phoned their Bangkok number from Manila -- and just got an automated message. They blame the pandemic for this but why are some airlines able to provide good customer service despite their staff still working from home? London-Bangkok-London flight used their new Boeing 777 (with first class cabin) but I could not see any difference in economy with their older Boeing 777 (Bangkok-Manila-Bangkok). Toilets were kept clean on all legs, and because it had fewer economy seats (3-3-3), there were hardly any queues for the toilets. Food is horrible. London-Bangkok-London leg: a 12-journey we were served only two meals, ie not a hot sandwich snack in between. We were not given a choice for breakfast: on both outbound and inbound flights, we were served the same thing -- chicken sausage, scrambled eggs and potatoes. For the dinner)I had green chicken curry -- it was not that good by Thailand standards but at least I could eat it. I am not a finicky eater, and I have come to expect airline food to not be delicious. I have flown Thai two years before and had a good experience with them (good food, service), which was why I chose to fly with them again.  The flight crew were attentive, but it would be better if they could serve the drinks as they serve the meal. At Thai, by the time the drinks trolley arrives, you have already finished eating your meal. Thank goodness they have bottled water that comes with the meal tray. I am not flying Thai again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Bangkok to Sydney,June 2022,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3,no,2,"  Not recommended. Thai Airways sells this as a direct flight but it lands in Phuket where you have to disembark, go through security again and wait another 45 min to reboard to Sydney. Add to this poor cabin service and annoyances like in flight entertainment being suspended 30 minutes before landing and I would not choose Thai Airways for future travel."

The plane was outdated, lavatory was very basic, food was  poor quality without choice, plastic cutlery.  Extremely low on staff, no one attended the request on multiple occasion. No wifi and basic entertainment. In summary Thai Airways service lack the basics. "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-8,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok,April 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,4,yes,8,"  It's been a few years since I last flew with Thai Airways. My impression of their business class had been subpar, in terms of food and hardware. In this trip they have redeemed themselves. The 787 business class has a 2x2x2 configuration, a little old school but fine nonetheless. What impressed me was the level of service and the improvement of food and drinks. On this short 2 hour flight, we were well fed (food was delicious and portion generous), and drinks were regularly topped up, it was a full flight too! My confidence with them has been restored."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo to Bangkok,May 2022,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,no,2,"  I booked a flight to Bangkok spontaneously (the next day) and only learned later that it's impossible to apply for the Thailand pass on such short notice.  The person from the Thai airways ticketing center did not mention this. When I arrived at the airport the next day my Thailand pass was still under review and the counter staff did not let me board the flight. She told me to wait and rebook the flight later if the pass is not approved in time. I waited at the counter and when the flight had left, the same person told me to call the ticketing hotline and rebook the flight. When I explained the situation to the ticketing center, they told me I have to pay an additional 220USD ""no-show"" penalty for ""missing"" my flight which the counter staff hasn't mentioned to me. The whole trip was very chaotic based on this lack of information and I'll avoid this airline in the future."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phuket to London,April 2022,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,4,no,6,"  The Boeing 787 looked shabby externally when it landed from Bangkok, with a very faded livery. Internally it was much the same and everything looked rather worn and unkempt, including some sticking tape holding part of the seat edge together on row 41. Washrooms were not what I would call clean. Food was so-so; two meals at start and approx. 3 hours out from London, plus a very odd tasting egg sandwich at about 6 hours in. Crew were friendly but not attentive; crew call button was never responded to on the three attempts I tried at various points throughout the flight. Mask wearing was not enforced despite several PA announcements. Garbage wasn't collected, nor were items such as blankets. In general I dislike the Dreamliner and try and avoid flying it (which is getting harder to do): 9 seats abreast feels a real squeeze in economy and the toilets are tiny and too few. The difference between the Thai 787 and the Emirates A380 and 777 on the outward journey was stark, both in terms of cabin comfort and service levels. Thai used to be great, but an obvious downgrade in service level, combined with operation of the 787 means a poorer travel experience. I'm wondering what their A380 offering is like?"
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chennai to Bangkok,April 2022,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,2,no,1," Thai Airways always had subpar operations but at least they had good food, relatively spacious cabin, and smiling (if not the most efficient) staff. After the pandemic, even the few remaining strengths have now disappeared. From my experience from my last interaction I can safely say that Thai Airways as we remember it is no more. It is now one of the worst airlines in Asia. This is why - my flight got delayed but no one at the check-in counter mentioned that and there was no status change when I checked online. After waiting 3.5 hours, the flight was delayed a further 3 hours. Again, no emails or texts - just the airport screen showing the update. Then the flight suddenly got cancelled. Again no communication from Thai in this regard. No Thai staff to be seen anywhere at the Chennai airport and we could not exit the security area so no way for us to contact Thai. I made three international calls from my mobile just to connect with Thai Airways in Bangkok. The saddest part was that their customer service people said they had no way to contact their staff in Chennai. That's when I knew Thai had hit bottom. Their local phone lines are literally disconnected and the staff ""helping"" me at the airport were wearing Air India uniforms. Only airline in the world which abruptly cancels their flight but their website even after 48 hours shows the flight took off and landed on time! If I get a refund I will be lucky."

Shortly after I booked the flight was cancelled by the airlines. I contacted them to request a refund, which was ""approved"" and I was told it would take 45-90 working days for a refund. It is now April 2022 and I have yet to receive my refund, despite following up multiple times with the airline. I don't understand why it would take over 5 months to refund my credit card."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300 ER,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Bangkok,March 2022,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,4,yes,7,"  This was my first time flying since COVID and I was a little disappointed. The aircraft was only just over 6 years old and wasn’t in the best kept condition. Economy was quite empty on this flight. You could see that the airline had spread passengers about which was great as you have to do a PCR test upon arrival. Food was lovely I must admit. If you wanted anything outside of service it was a long wait, although staff were pleasant. No WiFi, which I was surprised at. Don’t get me wrong it’s not the bee all and end all. The convenience on a direct flight is always a key factor when flying, but I did expect better. It wasn’t horrific, but just wasn’t what I’ve come to expect from Thai Airways."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Bangkok via Chennai,January 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  We booked our trip to fly to Chennai, India on 8th Jan 2922 and to return journey via Bangkok on 21st Jan. From Dec2021 we were contacted by Thai Airways infirming us of changing flight schedule multiple times, different versions in the morning which would be changed in the evening. Frustrated with these changes and uncertainty in their schedule we asked for cancellation. This was orally agreed. They also informed us refund will come through in 8 weeks time. We sent a cancellation request in email too. .. no response to that though. We have been chasing refund with no response, neither an email response or on phone. "

My original flight left Phnom Penh at 21.15 pm, arrived in Bangkok at 22.55pm and connected to the following long flight to Paris departing at 00.05 am. And now the proposed change means I am supposed to leave Phnom Penh at 9.40 am, meaning 12 hours before than planned and with the prospect of spending 14 hours in the Bangkok airport waiting for my next flight to Paris! As you can imagine, this is highly crazy because I won't be allowed to leave the airport given that Thailand has one of the most restrictive covid-related policies for travellers. I wrote straight away to Thai Airways' customer service seeking for a solution and for a week they have not answered my emails. This is not admissible, please be careful with your purchases with Thai Airways."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Delhi via Bangkok,December 2021,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  The worst Customer service ever. I understand my flight got cancelled multiple times and I was forced to stay in Thailand for 24 hours on my expenses because my mom was getting her surgery done and I had no choice but to do that to reach to my home country on time. On my return my ticket again got cancelled multiple times, I told the customer care to arrange something for me as I have to go back and start a new job and if I will not be back on tie, I will end up losing it but I got no response at all. I sent multiple emails to customer care to organise my refund on time so I can at least by myself another ticket but they sent no response. They finally acknowledged my email and said this is wrong department and send it to Sydney customer service instead of pro actively taking its responsibility.  It has been 2 long months, I would have sent them so many email for the return of the money but they have not acknowledged me.  I will never travel with THAI again for the unprofessional behavior they have shown. I am sure there will be many people out there suffering like me because of there laid back attitude or not taking customers seriously. I have never felt so frustrated and helpless."

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Milan to Frankfurt via Bangkok,February 2022,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,5.0,5,yes,9," I flew Thai before covid and with the threat of bankruptcy cancelled most flights to Europe. I was devastated when they stopped all flights. Although some European airlines I have used are generally good (flight crews), Thai has always stood out for me for the quality of their crew and service. And a big call out to the Milan Thai customer call centre who were the best and most efficient people I talked to. Fast response, polite and proactive unlike many others. This flight on 10th February from Malpensa to Frankfurt (Lufthansa) to Bangkok was superb. The crew were attentive, courteous, professional and worked as a team. The landing as my seat neighbor also stated was gentle just like its staff. Food and alcoholic drinks were limited in choice but this is a great airline that is starting to recover. Thank you for this great experience. I am glad you are back and wish you strength and success. I have just booked a flight back to Europe with you."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Copenhagen to Sydney via Bangkok,January 2022,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,3,no,5,"  My route was SYD-CPH via BKK return. With the exception of a tasty curry, every meal ranged from typical airline food (ie, quite awful) to inedible. One glass of wine with the meal was the only alcohol served.  Entertainment was hardly entertaining. Choice was very limited (eg Music channel consisted of 5 pod casts and one Thai Airways music selection). Movies were very old, no games or puzzles. The most entertaining screen was the live map which I viewed on-and-off for 19 hours. Service on first leg was very poor. Eg, when service manager was asked by a passenger if he had a pen for the disembarkation form he answered ""no"" and walked off. Other legs it was much better. No on-board duty free sales. Ground staff in CPH gave wrong information. Is this typical of Thai Airways or the new Covid airline?"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Phuket to Bangkok ,December 2021,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  2 years after bankruptcy and 2 years into COVID you would have thought TG would have taken the opportunity to address their customer service weaknesses… sadly not… flying fewer planes they are even worse than before, nothing has changed. It remains an airline run for the staff and not for the passengers. Check in was a car crash in a half built check in area. When we got to the gate, the usual performance, 1 person checking tickets, 4 people standing around looking important and a huge queue of fare paying customers going nowhere. I think it was their only international flight that evening and guess what we took off late -  nothing changes. On the aircraft, on the short hop to Phuket we weren’t offered a glass of water; interestingly the spare flight deck officer got a lovely meal, drink and attention from the crew,  people paying for the seat got nothing. The airline is awful and has made no attempt to improve itself, unless I am in an absolute emergency I will never fly with them again. "

I believe that what the Airline is doing is not logical nor it is credible. "
Not Verified ,Boeing 773,Business,Business Class,London to Bangkok,April 2021,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Honestly the worst flight (from booking through to landing) that I have ever had. Before flight needed to contact Thai Airways and all their phone lines are completely closed due to Covid. Only way to contact them is through email which they do not reply (still not received any reply after 6 weeks to an email sent before this flight) or Facebook messenger where they are unable to help with anything anyway. This fact alone should stop anyone booking with Thai Airways in the current Covid situation as if anything goes wrong that requires you to contact Thai Airways (which in the current situation is always a fairly high possibility) there is literally no way to contact them. As a comparison with my recent flight with Singapore Airlines they replied to emails within the hour, and phone calls within 2 minutes. Then the flight - Seats are the usual Thai Airways business class product. Nowhere near the best, but not bad and as expected. However for a 12 hour flight there was no inflight entertainment. Apparently due to risk of covid from people touching the screens. (Obviously that is completely different from people touching seats or trays). Far more important for safety should have been the used washbag that was still in my seat when I sat down, and the rubbish in my wife’s seat. Clearly Thai Airways cleaning measures during COVID are inferior to other airlines cleaning measures during normal times, let alone in the current situation. No WiFi. Didn't bother me as I rarely drink alcohol on planes, but for information purposes there is no alcohol available apparently due to Covid. Again for comparison Singapore Airlines inflight entertainment currently works fine. Clearly just a cost cutting measure from an airline in financial trouble. Which when paying a normal Business Class fare is just completely unacceptable. Poor quality food (economy class meal standard). Main served mostly cold. Of course being served on one tray is understandable in the situation, but what is not understandable is the pathetic quality. Again other airlines are still managing to serve good quality food. They frankly just seem to to be using COVID as an excuse to cut all costs and offer an appalling business product The only good thing that could be said about the whole experience is as usual the cabin crew were generally friendly when they were actually in the cabin. But that obviously does not make up for appalling food, no entertainment on a 12 hour Business Class Flight, no ability to contact anyone at the airline by phone to make changes to tickets (something that is actually more important during the current COVID situation, not less so), tired and worn seat, poor boarding procedures, uncompetitive carry on luggage for business class etc. Used to be a good airline (I have flown them many times before in First, Business and also Economy) but they have gone so far downhill I will never be flying them again unless I have a flight for which it is completely unavoidable. Would recommend people avoid them at all costs."

✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Family Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Rome,January 2020,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4,yes,10,"  Bangkok to Rome in January 2020.. I used my Royal Orchid Plus gold Frequent-flier upgrade to fly business class on this flight. I had reserved the meals onboard before checking in, as Thai have a small menu for business class fliers to choose from. Check in at Bangkok airport was very well appointed, with sit-down check in desks at Row A in Suvarnabhumi Airport. Even though they’re not part of the same alliance, they even checked my luggage through on Alitalia. Private security and immigration for biz/first is such a treat, i was through in seconds. Then you’re directly down an escalator to the Royal Orchid Lounge. It’s an amazing lounge, they even include a 30 minute free massage for biz passengers, and I recommend heading to the spa first thing before heading to the lounge to reserve your spa appointment. Boarding was done by bus and stairs, and we pushed back on time. Before pushback a flight attendant came around and greeted us by name. She confirmed my meal order and asked my mum what she would like for dinner. I found out from a friend flying to Brussels that all flights to Europe get the exact same choices when he sent me a picture of his dinner. Some interesting welcome drinks were bought to you, a choice of tamarind ice tea, champagne, and a Thai floral drink I cannot remember the name of. All flights had a very light load, and I  switched seats for sleeping/eating. The first course was foie gras terrine, followed by a Thai main course which I preordered, spicy shrimp coconut curry, served with a beef pho-style broth, and steamed veggies. It was just what I wanted. Comfort food. There was a small dessert before I dozed off. Before landing the flight attendant woke me up and promptly served a plate of cold cuts and cheese, but I wasn’t full so I asked for the Thai breakfast, boiled rice soup with Shrimp and pork meatballs.  On the return flight I had a veal dish for lunch, and Thai style omelette with boiled rice soup and chicken for breakfast, the veal dish was quite exquisite but the breakfast is easily described as comfort food for me. The new dishware is quite bleak. Service on the flights were immaculate. Very prompt as you should be on a late night flight, a full meal service finished an hour after takeoff. Day flights are a little less rushed. The flight attendants are courteous and professional. The seat is very comfortable and Thai provide a mattress cover which makes the bed  more comfortable. The footwell is also quite large. Ground service in Rome was very nice, the Alitalia lounge was very good. However I’d recommend taking a detour to the D gates and going to the Star Alliance Lounge in Fiumicino Airport. It’s got very nice views of the airport. Overall I cannot fault Thai Airways product."

I have a doctors certificate stating I am healthy and not showing symptoms, but this isn't enough and I'm not allowed on the flight. When I then ask for a refund, Thai charge me $150 to get my refund. This is completely ridiculous as I did not choose to cancel my flight, I was not allowed on the flight!

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Perth,April 2020,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Whilst on my holiday in Bangkok, Thai Airways changed my flight from 28.3.2020 00.01 am to 29.3.2020 7.20 am changing my flight from TG483 to TG481 with no consent and no prior communication. As soon as I received an e-mail notifying me about this change, I contacted Thai airways via e-mail stating we could not fly on the 29th so the flight would have to be moved to the 25th or the 27th. I sent this same e-mail to 4 different email addresses to not receive a reply for 4 days - ended up having a reply from the Sydney office. I explained the situation and asked for the 29th flight that we couldn’t take to be moved to an earlier date with a few options and again didn't receive a reply for a another few days! and the reply I received kept stating that Thai airways would be cancelling flights from 27th march onwards. If that were the case, why couldn’t Thai airways accommodate my request of simply changing the 29th flight to an earlier date? At this point I had to book and pay for another flight departing on the 25th. I had to also call the 24 hour line multiple times to have an automated message inform me the call will drop out after 15 minutes at the same time stating the wait time was 27 minutes, I had the hotel call to try and speak to someone who knew anything and could possibly help only to be hung up on and told 'I can help you', you need to contact the Perth office when I return to Australia '. To this day I still have no reply from any of my e-mails I sent trying to correct flights from the date of change on 18 March 2020 and I had relentlessly been trying. Such poor customer service and showed no care for rectifying any issues they have caused or even a response for clarity."

Comfortable seat, good friendly efficient cabin crew. Flight was smooth and uneventful. Cons - Entertainment was not as varied as some (could take lessons from Emirates, Qatar and EVA) with poor choice of music and almost all TV shows were American - don't Thai know there are very good TV shows made in other English speaking countries?. Food was tasty and hot but portions were small. No menu cards offered so, didn't know what was being served until cabin crew offered ""chicken or pork""? No mention of other items on the food tray. Mid flight sandwiches were kept in galley and not offered to seated passengers. At no point (other than meal times) did cabin crew come round offering drinks. Thai isn't a bad airline but, with simple attention to detail it could be so much better and only then would it be a real challenger to Emirates, Qatar or EVA. As it stands Thai lags behind the opposition."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Heathrow via Bangkok,February 2020,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,no,2,"  London to Manila via Bangkok. I had the reservation to fly back on 2nd February 2020. My flight on the 2nd of Feb 2020 from Manila to Bangkok was cancelled after several hours of delays. Passengers including me were allowed inside the aircraft and made to wait for a long time before it was cancelled. We were not given proper updates while we waited at the gate to board the aircraft. Only a ground staff when I asked personally, told me that there is a fuel leak and the engineers were working to fix the problem. The departure was scheduled for 1910 hours. At around 2100 hours, we were given a sandwich each and a drink. Then, for the next eight hours (0500 Hours on 3rd Feb 2020), I had not had another drink. We were made to wait for hours for the bus to take us to the hotel. Bus took over an hour to depart from the airport. After reaching the hotel, it took another hour or more to get us into the lobby of the hotel, as we were told to remain in the bus. Some people got out to buy snacks against your staff’s instructions.  At 0500 I got into my hotel room. Breakfast was open from 6am. We were told to check out of the rooms by 2pm and the flight was supposed to leave at 5pm. We waited until 3:30pm at the lobby of the hotel to be boarded on the bus. After boarding the bus, the driver sat doing nothing. After waiting for over 45 minutes, I asked the driver, what are you waiting for. He said, airline staff. Then he got out of the bus, walked to the reception, returned in 2 minutes and drove us to the airport. There were no airline staff and there were no more passengers waiting for transportation to go to the airport. We just sat in the bus for someone to give the driver directions as what to do next. The flight departed at 1910 hours (7:10PM) on the 3rd Feb 2020, 24 hours later than it was supposed to. Never once I saw a senior Thai Airways personnel. I saw a few ground crew who were inexperienced and some unruly passengers intimidated them by their rude behaviour. "

Flight was quite short for only 2 hours or less so it's understandable they serve food right after we took off. Food was good (I had chicken and my friend had prawn rice) though portion was a bit small. The dessert was quite good. The crew service was also quite great with friendliness and politeness (though misunderstanding may occur as some staff doesn't speak good English). We boarded a Boeing 777 so obviously seating was quite good. probably cuz of the flu season there're not so many passengers so it felt very spacious. A bonus point for the crew was that they knew about this and try to separate individual passengers far away from each other to get more comfort. Seat can be reclined quite easy, no major technical fault. IFE is quite up-to-date with basic movies package and also game. Though in some seats the IFE may not work. Great experience overall. Thai airways has proven me that they're a good airline just like how people think about them. If possible I'd like to fly with them again whenever going for another Bangkok adventure or even better a transit to another place."

The business cabin was old, seats worn-out, minuscule screens. A seating arrangment without an inch of privacy (vis a vis the alley and fellow travellers) if you were allocated odd number sats. To make it short, an old cabin that looks really outdated compared to its peers such as Qatar, Emirates, Etihad or Oman Air. Service & cabin crew are friendly, corteous and efficient. On the other hand, wines are second rated, and again, the selection can't stand comparison with mentioned newer competition. Same for the food, not bad, but not really appealing - a bit too much frozen/heated dinner from your supermaket frozen section. ""Of course"" no onboard wifi, 20 years ago Thai Airways was the asian excellency or close to, today competition makes it look a bit cheap and under retrofitted to new standards. Don't get me wrong, will fly again but only if fare is really good. Will prefer MEA airlines when possible & convenient (at least this flight was non-stop)."

Needed to fly to Melbourne from Bangkok with Thai but unfortunately due to an official advice, tried to delay the flight for 10 days due to the coronavirus concerns of the university. When tried to change the departure date by 10 days due to this reason (asked for no additional charge due to the health emergency), they asked to pay for this one way return flight to pay additional 25% of the total flight price (both legs) - this is just unacceptable to make profit on a health crisis!

The service onboard was rushed on a 11 hours 45 minutes flight. We are traveling with Thai air during the virus outbreak so all crew have mask on but When you have mask on, passengers cant see your smile. The crew I encountered were arrogant to me.  The seats are good for me but they need to upgrade the screen though. The touchscreen display is not responsive, the contents are good.

Initial routing was from Guangzhou China. Had huge problems in Hanoi airport as my flights to-from China were suspended due to Corona, so I had to rebook tickets in last Minute at check-in counters in Hanoi. Fortunately, competent Thai Airways staff and station manager helped me through as my ticket, which involved other airlines beyond BKK, was complicated and furthermore issued by a non-responsive OTA. Eventually, I paid cash 179 USD for a complicated ticket change which was OK despite I then accepted a downgrade from business to economy class. Inboard, food was fabulous to my taste (grilled snapper with rice mixture), and I managed to get 4 portions as there were plenty leftovers - many people don’t like fish. Other, tasty dish was creamy stewed chicken, also very good. Drinks provided and plenty, alcoholic as well though these were very hidden, not displayed on trolleys, and only discretely handed out. Bus gating in Bangkok from aircraft to terminal was an anti-climax of and otherwise very good trip."

All in all, I would definitely fly this airline again. In fact, I'm going to actively try to book it over others when I'm going back to Thailand or its neighbors assuming the price difference is minimal. Check in was smooth in Manila airport despite a decent sized queue and not too early-just on time arrival in the terminal. Boarding and sitting was pretty organized. The plane was well maintained and I enjoyed the leg room considering I bought a fare that was around the price of a budget flier. The crew was not just efficient in service but very helpful in the passengers' needs. Meals were enjoyable and I actually finished the rice. (I usually skip it and just eat the main itself). IEM was alright, a bit above average I would say. You can tell they update it. My one hiccup is it was pain to reach customer service(at least in the Philippines) before my flight as I had wanted to make adjustments. For whatever reason, I find Thai Airways to have a certain character and charm to it in every step, I guess just like their home country. From their very accommodating crew to the plane itself. A very underrated flagship."

The experience was below average. Firstly the Royal silk lounge was crowded poor service a really poor range of food including slices of pizzas baked last week it seems; Sandwiches that must’ve been prepacked before Christmas and a poor range of drinks. The aircraft itself was a Boeing 747 from the 80s we still had much of the regional equipment including those old red blue green projectors and pulldown screens! Boarding was chaotic with lines all over the place and to check-in staff for around 400 people that each checked your passport before anyone so boarding time to look in excess of 40 minutes. Why Thai would use a 747 to fly just an hour and a little bit more to a domestic location is beyond me. The plane was very tired and really poor entertainment system. There were no headsets and staff said because it was a short flight they would not be providing headsets. We were not offered any alcohol just water ice tea or orange juice. The Steward seems so early and unhappy not the characteristic expectations of Thai airlines. Yes I understand this is a short flight but all that was offered was one choice of meal which was salmon on white bread with wasabi and a side salad. Too bad if you were vegetarian or didn’t like salmon, my partner could not eat anything on this flight because of that choice. No explanation about why that might not of been a few more choices. You think Thai Airways would make it up with some really good service? Know the stewards were a little bit surly and not very happy about doing this service. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to London,January 2020,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,,5.0,2,no,3,"  My wife and I travelled business class on Thai Airways flight Bangkok to London on Friday 24 January. Despite being a daytime flight leaving Bangkok at 13.20, soon after a nice lunch the window blinds were lowered and cabin lights turn off. When questioned, the excuse from the crew member was ‘some people want to rest’. This ignored the fact that clearly most people didn’t - as could be seen from their active tv screens. And those who did could have used an eye mask rather than have such an unreasonable experience on everyone else.  I understand they do the same on the reverse leg, but thankfully we escaped making the discovery. Other than to bring hot towels and give out bags of popcorn, the crew did no more than serve two meals. The rest of the time they hid behind curtains with there being one period of some 4 hours when no one passed through the cabin. And at no point did we receive proactive attention or even have an engaging conversation that would have made us feel welcome and valued. The seats were somewhat narrow, with less than satisfactory control of the recline feature and here was no optional mattress. Having travelled between London and Bangkok every year for the past 8 years, we had decided to try Thai Airways for a change and with positive expectations. Sadly our experience was the very opposite. "

The flights on A350 and B787 equipment were very pleasant, with friendly cabin crew, a smooth check-in process, comfortable lounges, and much tastier vegetarian meals than are usually served in the air. All flights operated on time. The aircraft were clean and the seats comfortable, though it's worth noting that the B787 used on regional services has 2-2-2 seating in Business, compared with 1-2-1 on the A350 used for longhaul services. On the downside, we had bus transfers in Bangkok on the outward journey, and the boarding process at Bangkok was chaotic both times, with no clear queue for Business Class passengers among all the people milling around in the departure lounge. Also, on the older B777 aircraft between Bangkok and Kolkata the IFE was not working at all and the seats were hard and uncomfortable. This was partly compensated for by the friendly crew service and good food. Overall we enjoyed flying with Thai and would happily do it again."

I am a frequent international flyer and this was my first flight for more than ten years with Thai Airways. The service on both legs was exceptional and better than a number of other airlines I have flown this year, the seat was very comfortable, the meals were superb, the entertainment was better than most but not quite as good as some. There was a couple of hours layover in Bangkok, a long hike through the airport and an even longer queue for transiting passengers. However, the business class lounge was very comfortable and the food was good (although by this stage I wasn't really hungry). I would happily fly always with Thai if only the schedule for the return journey was better. I am writing this review because Thai didn't appear in the top 20 airlines for Skytrax review in 2019 and I think that Thai is much better than some of those airlines in the top 20."

So I was thrilled to see that our first leg on our flight from Mumbai to Chiang Mai via Bangkok was onboard a Thai Airways 747-400. Not only does Thailand have a reputation for friendliness, their airline has always been up there somewhere in the top 20. They say you should never go back to childhood memories, like where you grew up. The same goes for aircraft. The “Queen” that took us from India to Thailand was a tired old lady. The seats hadn’t been cleaned in ages and some were broken. The monitors in the seatbacks were still original equipment. The staff, on the other hand, were amazing. From the moment we arrived at check-in to final farewell on disembarkation – it was smiles, smiles and more smiles. If this review were on service alone it would be 10 thumbs up. But then the food was served – a bitter disappointment. Our connecting flight (Bangkok to Chiang Mai) onboard one of Thai Airways’ newer A330s was a refreshing change. Everything worked, the staff were great and luckily the flight was too short for a meal, other than a light snack (which was okay). 4 Thumbs Up"

It was delicious. The flight attendants were friendly and attentive and offered drinks before and after the dinner service. The seat is a fully reclining full flat seat which would be very useful for long haul flights. The inflight entertainment system is adequate with a modest selection of Western movies and Thai documentaries. There was inflight wifi but I didn’t use it.

I was told by a flight attendant on my previous flight up to Bangkok that the Bangkok - Chiangmai Business Class is invariably always full. The aircraft operating this route is an old A330-300 arranged in a 2-2-2 configuration with recliner seat. For domestic and short haul routes within Southeast Asia, it doesn’t really matter much. As it was a short flight of 1 hour, lunch service started immediately after attaining cruising altitude. Even though the cabin crew were hard pressed to complete service within a short time, they were pleasant and always smiling. A hot lunch of Pad Thai omelette was served on this flight. As soon as I finished eating, it was time to land in Bangkok. Overall, for a short domestic flight, Thai Airways’ Business Class product was excellent - far better than intra-Europe flights on European airlines."

Flew on Thai Airways again for my return trip to Singapore. As with the previous flight, it was operated by a nearly 20 years old Boeing 777-300, however, the aircraft was the ""Royal Barge Suphannahong"", HS-TKF, which was very beautiful. Although the interior was the same as on other Thai 777-300s, it was very well maintained and very clean, the seat itself was very comfortable, no complaints there. Once again, the IFE selection was very generous and very good for a 5hr+ flight, never mind one that was the only 2hrs! As with the previous flight, the cabin crew were extremely warm and made us feel welcome and well-treated - definitely worthy of the branding that Thai gives its cabin service, ""Royal Orchid Service"". Dinner was served on this flight, and it was plentiful, well presented, and the quality was also good - a special dessert was even provided to commemorate Thailand's ""Loy Krathong Day"". Despite traffic congestion encountered due to the many planes taking off before my flight, the pilots managed to make up for lost time en route and we arrived only a few minutes behind schedule. Overall, it was a very excellent experience given the price, and I would definitely recommend Thai Airways to anyone who wants to fly to Bangkok for their price point and onboard service."

Flew on Thai Airways on my recent retreat to Bangkok. Aircraft used was a Boeing 777-300, which has been in service for over 20 years; however the aircraft was well-maintained by Thai Airways and the cabin was very clean, the seat showed no signs of its age (apart from the IFE which was very small, but with a generous selection it was certainly very reasonable for a 2hr+ flight and suitable even on longer ones due to the selection). Cabin crew were very friendly and warm, greeting every passenger with a smile and the service provided was very warm and made us feel like privileged guests - definitely suiting of the cabin service that Thai appropriately named ""Royal Orchid Service"". However, the food served in flight was quite poor in quality and I felt it could definitely be improved on. The flight took off and landed on time, no problems, taxi in and taxi out were both very fast. Overall, it was definitely an excellent flight, despite the food served which was a letdown, and I would definitely choose Thai again for its price and their service."

The configuration in Business Class is 2-3-2. It would appear to be very cramped for business class but this is the regional business class configuration for the short two-hour flight to Bangkok. The seat is an angled flat seat. Leg room was very generous and your legs do not have to go under a small footwell like in some types of seats. Upon boarding, the flight attendants served welcome drinks. I had the signature Thai Tamarind Tea which was nice. Shortly after take off, breakfast was served. I had the Thai option - Tom Yam chicken rice. Being a short flight, the meal was served on a tray. The inflight entertainment system has adequate selection for this short flight. Headphones provided were not noise cancelling headphones but plastic over ear headphones. After the meal service, it was time to descend into Bangkok.

They seem to bring out the starters in a random order and with no drinks trolley I was left sitting with the starter and no drink to match. If you decide to wait for a drink it means that they’ve already put your main on so in my case it was served cold. The cheese was nice but served with oranges, melons and grapefruit but no grapes. There was port on the trolley but they weren’t inclined to open it until I asked and then served it in a thimble.

We get the message that our ticket was a promotion ticket (we never noticed this) and that no seats are available in other flight. When we check the correct flight, we still find seats available. Then they come with the excuse that it's not the same class. We are not talking about difference between business or economy. Apparently, Thai Airways also divide the economy in different classes with each letter of the alphabet. When we look closer, we see that every day the tickets are divided in different classes which makes it impossible to switch to another day in same class. Instead of helping us for the mistake, customer support keeps hiding behind the 'there are no tickets in same class' or proposes very high cost for cancellation of half the ticket price per person. Even when we are offering to pay the difference in price or a reasonable fee, the answer stays that they can't help us. As every day has different classes, Thai Airways makes it impossible to switch.

My experience with Thai Airways couldn't have been more disappointing (food-wise) on both 'to and from' flights. My flight had a layover in Bangkok, which means I took 4 planes and 4 meals in total. The food was so awful, no taste at all! The chicken tasted like plastic, the curry was horrible, as were the vegetables. The food was so bad, I refused 2 meals on my 12hr flight from Bangkok to Brussels! The cabin crew came only twice to serve water on the 12hrs flight. With the very dry air blowing from the A/C, this was very shocking. Inflight entertainment is very poor. The choice is very restricted. The Airbus A350 was pretty uncomfortable. The seats have almost no knee room. I'm 183cm. You have to be very lucky that the passenger up front doesn't recline his seat, or else, you're pretty screwed. Long live the money making industry."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Milan,October 2019,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I would like to acknowledge Thai Airways for an excellent flight from Bangkok to Milan Malpensa. They show that flying in economy can still be a great experience: excellent attention to service, the best and most complete meals and drinks in flight. Its what flying could be about for many travelers. This is the second international flight in one year I have done and they are keeping the standards.  No flight delays, no lost baggage. Well done Thai."

I would like to state that I used Thai Airways hearing that they were a good airline to fly with. Service was standard and drinks were given sparingly. Crew were not very friendly and overall I would have rather flown with another carrier. A380 aircraft no air vents and the cabins were warm. Pretty rubbish flight and wouldn’t used them again. Wouldn’t recommend.

Tired looking crew that certainly do not know what a smile even is. Crew could not serve dinner quick enough - almost felt like it was thrown at us. Ran out of salty snacks prior to this, and crew member said he would come back with more, but never did so many did not even get this. Breakfast was inedible - both myself and my husband didn't eat our bland white looking breakfast. No drinks served through night on 10.5 hour flight. Movie choice terrible and connectivity no better. Did not perform important pre-landing check, a lady opposite us had her laptop out throughout landing and they did not check seat belts or anything. This is pretty basic and essential. Gave Thai Airways 2 tries and both flights very lacklustre service. We are frequent flyers, but will not fly them again."

Good points: Highly attentive crew, excellent food and service - free-flowing alcohol for fellow fliers - and very smooth transit at Bangkok with a dedicated immigration lane, my bags checked through the Chiang Mai. The seating on the Airbus from Perth was disappointingly cramped, the leg room poor compared to budget airlines - not so for Boeing 777 on the internal flight, the aircraft long-in-the-tooth and looking it. lacking at-seat power supplies."

I had a good experience with flights within Thailand with Thai Airways but this flight was very disappointing. I understand that the flight was fully booked and staff could be stressed with but the staff should understand that being friendly and polite is as same important as the security of flight guests.  The stewardess offered me 2 types of meal - pork and chicken. I choose chicken but got pork instead, without any excuse."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vientiane to Bangkok,August 2019,4.0,2.0,1.0,,,4.0,3,yes,4,"  Vientiane to Bangkok on Thai Airways evening departure. The flight this evening was operated by HS-TER, a nine year old Airbus A330 named U Thong. As usual I had filled in my API information and checked in online. On arrival at VTE, I headed straight for the Internet check-in counter. Ground staff were on hand directing passengers. There was already a line up. However when we approached the head of the line, a senior ground service staff directed us to the Royal Silk check-in counter and processed us quite efficiently. She was warm and friendly. Security check and immigration wasn't too long (perks of a small airport) and we were at the gate with about an hour and a half to spare. At about 7:40 PM we were advised that the incoming aircraft was delayed out of BKK, due to which departure was delayed by 20 minutes, making the new departure time 8:50 PM. Boarding at 08:40 PM was chaotic with no designated order or series as is the norm with wide-body aircraft. Mind you, there was an announcement of boarding by row numbers, but the staff at the gate didn't seem to be too bothered. There was a dedicated line for loyalty program elite tiers and business class passengers. The welcome on board was friendly, but hardly the warmth one associates with Thai Airways. The seat was the standard economy on A330, equipped with a personal television. On this short haul sector the in-flight entertainment was deactivated and the only display was the rather outdated flight map. The seat pocket contained a copy of Sawasdee, Vision (the in-flight entertainment listing), duty free shopping guide and a promotional document from the Thai government. The flight was delayed further and we finally took off 36 minutes late. The service on board was lacklustre. The crew were neither friendly nor warm. The quality of cuisine served was unimpressive. Naturally, I compared it to the Thai Smile aircraft that I took for the inward bound flight and the food was below average. The meal on offer was a cheesy mushroom calzone with too much of the pastry accompanied by a rather shoddy choux cream custard and a bottle of water. This was followed by the crew making a trip down the aisle with orange juice and tea/coffee. They played the Thai Immigration video which mandated that one must complete the TM6 form provided by the airline. Needless to say, the crew waited until the last minute to start distributing these even though we were on the tarmac in VTE for quite some time. Eventually after they handed out the form, the crew member approached me to stow my tray table for landing. I couldn't help but respond with, ""If you wanted to secure the cabin, you might have handed these out a bit earlier."" I am  of the opinion that Thai Smile is the better product on this route."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Brussels,June 2019,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2,no,4," On June 23th 2019 I took flight TG 934 from Bangkok Suvarnabhumi to Brussels having a full flex ticket. When the staff brought the aperitive we didnt receive any salty snack. At lunchtime the air hostess asked what I would like to drink. I answered that I would like a glass of white wine with the starter and a glass of red wine with the main dish so she wouldn't have to pass by 2 times. It was publicly refused in a rude haughty diminishing way, replying that that I could only have one drink at the time. Thai Airways appear to have overstaffed, overaged unmotivated workers, nepotism, lack off busines vision, poor marketing stategy, poor financial managment. Last year I already experienced a similar situation thinking it was a singular incident. But it seems to become recurrent. Privatisation seems unavoidable."

I really enjoyed flying the new A350, despite that a few things made my flight experience unpleasant. Crew was nice but it felt like they were unorganized. I was asked if I ordered a special meal twice, and the FA said that someone ordered a special meal to my seat, 59C but the seat wasn’t even booked, I  sat there because I changed my seat before takeoff, my original seat was 59K. Overall the flight was ok.  I booked 6 Flights for this year and have been flying on 2 of them. My other flight from Frankfurt to Bangkok on 30th of July this year was ok, despite me having to change my seat with one passenger sitting next to me, which I booked long before the flight. I hope that my next 4 Flights will be more pleasant."

Thai Airways indeed a 5 star airlines with great cabin service. It all started from the airport lounge service. They provide 30 minutes free massage just across the hall from the lounge. This is something special I have never experienced before. My flight was delayed a little bit.  There are free shower for business passengers too. On the plane the cabin crew were super friendly. I didn't try the first meal because it was very late. I had breakfast before landing. It was very good, fresh fruits and yogurt! If there is one thing I'd like to pick, the plane is little old. Overall, I had excellent experience with Thai Airways."

The only negative point of flying with Thai is the transit at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok. Not comfortable at all, poor duty free and no smoking area."

Then after take off, lunch was served. I pre ordered a beef fillet and grilled salmon for my wife. Both were great. Staff service pampered the guest all during the flight. The only thing I haven’t found at high level was the IFE. There are 5 star airlines that are not meeting this quality."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 773 / A350,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kansai to Melbourne via Bangkok,July 2019,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,5,yes,10,"  Kansai to Melbourne via Bangkok. The aircraft on the first sector (Osaka - Bangkok) was switched on the day of travel from an A380 to a B773ER. Despite the change to a smaller aircraft I was still given my seating preference and there was zero problem with my special meal. Seat pitch on both aircraft (773 to Bangkok and A350) to Melbourne was as good as economy seating gets nowadays, and thankfully the seating on the 773 was 9 across and not the 10 across many airlines have installed. Safety checks were made before departure and landing, and there were announcements before any turbulence, which turned out to be mild. Service on both sectors was exemplary, the crew were smiling and helpful through out despite both flights being nearly full. People have criticised the IFE for lack of choice, but in its favour I’ve found it to be reliable, and I generally find plenty to enjoy in the world music and world movies sections. A meal and a snack were served on the shorter (five hour) flight to Bangkok, and supper and breakfast were served on the flight to Australia. The food was of a reasonable standard, there was a full drinks service before lunch and dinner and in addition there were nice little touches, like the crew offering extra croissants at breakfast. On the overnight flight to Australia I was able to sleep but was aware of several water/juice runs during the night. On both flights, especially towards the end of the longer Melbourne flight, the crew were focussed on keeping the washrooms clean and serviceable. It’s service as it should be, totally professional; my overall rating is 10/10 because I couldn’t ask for any more than was given."

Even the short, one hour flight from Bangkok to Chiang Mai was a reminder that not all in the aviation industry have succumbed to fleecing the customer for every last cent. It was a busy flight, but the cabin crew provided complimentary snacks, drinks, tea and coffee with habitual grace. The cabin itself felt spacious, seats were comfortable and leg room was better than most in economy."

✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Business,Business Class,Bangkok to Melbourne,July 2019,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5,yes,9,"  Bangkok to Melbourne. I recently travelled around the world on a UA/LH/TG ticket and can honestly say that Thai are the best of these 3 airlines. How Lufthansa warrants 5 stars whilst TG gets 4 and UA a measly 3 is beyond me. The service, seating and menus on Thai are much better than both airlines and they offer individual pods on the A350, whereas LH and UA still have the older style seating where one has to climb over their neighbour to reach the aisle. It's great to see that Thai is now ranked in the top ten, but they deserve a far higher score given their recent improvements."

✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Bangkok,February 2019,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,4,yes,7,"  Frankfurt to Bangkok. As we were on the train to Frankfurt, we get an email saying the flight is canceled. This was because of the incoming flight did not leave Bangkok. We were able to check-in and have our bags tagged anyway. They have arranged for accommodation at a hotel at the airport, including dinner and breakfast. Next day another plane arrived and we managed to depart with a considerable delay. The flight was uneventful and the service on board was very good.  But after clearing immigrations in Bangkok, we could not find our luggage. So we went to Lost & Found to announce it. They could not tell us what happened and where is the luggage. Anyway, we gave them our contact details and went to our hotel. About one day later they called us and brought the luggage to the hotel. After all this trouble we decided to make a claim under the EU regulation for the delayed arrival. The communication with them had to happen in writing using letters. So the entire process was long and even though they had all our data in their systems, they still requested extra documents to be submitted. Finally, we have managed to get the requested compensation. So the overall experience was not bad, but I would have expected better treatment from this company."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Nagoya to Bangkok,September 2018,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10," Nagoya to Bangkok. I feel that the way an airline could be judged well is the way they handle a situation which is out of their control. Typhoon Jebi had struck Osaka three days into a five day holiday, which left Osaka Kansai airport flooded and all flights there were cancelled. We were scheduled to leave Osaka on the 6th of September. The night before, I asked my parents to call Thai Airways (as they were in Bangkok) at an odd hour, and the agent on the phone re-booked us through Nagoya without any additional charge. We did, however, have to pay for the high-speed rail tickets for the journey to Nagoya. Thai Airways had also upsized the aircraft from a Boeing 787-8 to a Boeing 777-300 High-Density configuration. This meant that we did not get the brand new B787, but we understood the situation. Despite being rebooked on that flight last-minute, at check in we were given exit row seats, and we even had an empty seat between us. Due to a meeting my friend was supposed to attend the day after we were originally supposed to arrive, we chose a very odd flight time. Leaving at Half past midnight and arriving at half past four am in the morning. Nagoya Airport is extremely desolate at this time of night, and no duty-free chocolates were being sold, a huge disappointment as that is a must whenever leaving Japan. The flight was boarded extremely quickly, even though the plane was almost full, and we took off 30 minutes before the scheduled departure time. After takeoff, the crew literally ran through the cabin with cold sandwiches and drinks. I did not mind this at all. The service was rushed so everyone could get some much-needed sleep. I fell asleep shortly after and then was woken up by the crew wheeling the breakfast cart near my seat. I noticed they just looked around and served passengers when they woke up. I saw that everyone was definitely fed. The seat on this 19-year-old Boeing 777-300 was comfortable, an old plush seat that was slightly worn, but still had TVs at every seat but I can't comment on legroom as I had an exit row. If you're flying the newer B777-300ER, there is no bulging slide at the exit doors, but this older plane still had a slide. I did not mind it. We arrived an entire hour early, at which point Suvarnabhumi airport is as deserted as can be. In the end, this was a crisis made a lot better. They did the right thing as this was an act of god yet they still took as much responsibility as they could. The only thing I am slightly disappointed about was the fact that we weren't compensated for the high-speed rail tickets. I am a regular user of Thai Airways, and would absolutely not worry about anything at all as they deal with crises as smooth as silk."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Milan to Bangkok,July 2019,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,3.0,5,yes,10,"  Milan to Bangkok was a joyful experience after having flown in to Europe via Finnair that was the direct opposite. The Thai Airways meal service was good, snacks and drinks - including alcholol that you had to pay for in Premium economy on the other airline was free. Staff were fabulous. In economy they still care about you."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350 / A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Guangzhou to London via Bangkok,June 2019,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,5,yes,9,"  I flew from Guangzhou to Heathrow with a brief layover in Bangkok Suvarnabhumi. Thai Airways was excellent overall with the food being possibly the best airline food I have tasted, generous legroom, reliable and high quality entertainment, a pleasant interior and ambiance and friendly and professional staff. Also the flight attendants were generous with free drinks including alcohol plus the snack boxes at each galley provided a pleasant touch. The only negatives were the wifi was hard to long into and queues in Suvarnabhumi Airport's transit area being too long due to checkpoints being too small, although the latter is the fault of the Thai Airports' Authority not Thai Airways. I therefore strongly recommend Thai Airways to all fliers."

The western breakfast was good, but only one option for breakfast (I miss an asian option). The cutlery was of disposal materials and not metal like before. They have also dropped real glass, salt and pepper on your meal tray. The female flight attendant at my row, was grumpy and never smiled. She did her work but no more than that. I miss Thai Airways from the past, but I guess that the nice service has gone for good due to savings."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Hong Kong,June 2019,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,3,no,3,"  Bangkok to Hong Kong. This flight got off to a bad start. Not having flown TG business class for almost a decade, I got out of my taxi at Gate 1 on the east side of the terminal as advised by the airport sign. Searching for business class bag drop, I could only see domestic counters. I noticed a signboard saying international was actually at counters H/J. Once I got there, another sign said only economy, not business. So back I trooped to discover biz class is rather hidden to the left of the domestic counters! Bag drop, security and fast track Immigration were speedy, but with the departure gate being at the opposite west end of the airport, there was then the ghastly long hike through one massively long shopping mall with no people movers to make it easier.  The TG lounge had no croissants, sandwiches with only white bread and a sickly sweet ersatz orange juice. At least the espresso was enjoyable. Boarding at Gate E1 is a bus gate. Although the bus I took was clearly marked “Business and First Class Passengers”, I later discovered only two other biz passengers were on it. All the seats and most of the standing room were taken by economy passengers. There then followed a 10-minute bus ride back all the way along the airport and round to the domestic section which was exactly where I had started before the hike. Why it is not possible for passengers to board from a gate on the East side seems incomprehensible and just makes flying TG short haul so frustrating. After hauling bags up ramp steps I finally made it on board. Service on the A330 was attentive, but having chosen the western lunch, the salmon, although it looked nice enough, was utterly tasteless. I have had more tasty meals in economy on some other Asian carriers. My other issue with is the appalling IFE listing. No explanation or timings for the video offerings. The music listing is bizarre. Want some classical music? How about something by Schumann? Well that listing is “Robert Schumann” as the composer and then “Robert Schumann” again as the work. No detail of what Schumann work one might hear. The flight departed and arrived on time. On the return trip, the aircraft was parked at a bus gate. Half way to the terminal, the bus stopped allegedly to let an aircraft pass. Only there was no aircraft. So we stood there packed like sardines for more than 5 minutes for no reason. Unlikely I will be on TG again soon."

It's only when you travel long distances in Economy in spacious aeroplanes like the A380 and Boeing 747-400 that I realise how poky and cramped the A350/787 is. The LHR-BKK sectors were in the A380 and we secured window seats on the top deck (well worth the slight price premium). BKK to DPS was in the Boeing 747, and we got the sought-after two seaters near the back of the plane. Seats were pretty comfy in all cases with acres of space, and the provision of food and drink was quite generous in all sectors. All flights were on time and boarding/exiting was efficient. I see the other LHR-BKK flight is in a 777, and it cannot be long before THAI retire the 744's, so the days of doing Europe to Bali in such style are no doubt numbered, so my advice is to choose Thai and do it while you still can."

There was an aircraft change from an A350 to a B777-300ER, so I was slightly disappointed. Check in at 4:45 am meant only one star gold counter was open, and a line soon formed. The royal silk lounge at concourse E was adequate but felt slightly crammed. Priority boarding was honoured and I chose an exit row for this flight, however there was no window! Avoid row 40 on the 777. The seat is good, although it is a slimline design the padding is very supportive and there is even an option to adjust the lumbar support. After takeoff, meals were served, and on flights to Japan, the Japanese breakfast is much preferable to the omelette and sausage option. Before landing a chinese takeaway box style snack is served. Inside was some rice with stir-fried chicken on top. This is much more creative than a hot sandwich or wrap! Entertainment in the month of April was not the best, however I think this has changed from month to month. Arrival at Kansai Airport is efficient and fast, we were on a train to Osaka within 15 minutes, including picking up our luggage. Our return flight was slightly disappointing. Normally we always choose the upper deck on the A380, but there weren't any window seats left, so we chose the bulkhead row on the lower deck. Check in was quite a disaster. We stood behind a long queue, puzzled if it's the business class queue or the economy class queue. The staff quickly came and gave us an answer, but within 10 minutes we were attended to at the check in desk. They did not check through my bag to my final destination, Trat as that was on a codeshare flight with Bangkok Airways. The flight was delayed, so by the time I got to the Bangkok Airways check in counters the flight was a minute away from closing. By the time I had gotten to the ANA lounge, I had realised that I had forgotten my bag at security. I walked to the gate, and they confirmed that my bag had been pulled over for a search and I had forgotten it there. 50 minutes before the flight was going to close for boarding, the assistant station manager took me through immigration again, up to security and retrieved my bag, and then we were back to the gate, at which point the priority line was empty. Thai Airways also took a little bit of inspiration from their Japanese competition by asking each aisle to board through different doors. The service on this flight was slow."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Kathmandu via Bangkok,May 2019,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,1,no,1,"  Perth to Kathmandu via Bangkok. I was traveling with an extra 20kg of luggage. Thai Airways charged me $55 / kg of extra baggage on my way to Nepal. How is this legal? I was stuck at the checkout counter, trying to figure out if it was cheaper to book a new flight on Singapore Air 2 hours before departure. I asked if I could buy another ticket, which was ~$300 USD, and they explained that it didn't work that way because their database can't handle duplicate name entries. Then I had to contemplate which pieces of luggage I could keep and which to throw away. So the cost of my trip tripled due to this baggage policy. When I got back to the US, I was unable to get anyone from customer service on the phone, and email responses were unhelpful and unsympathetic."

Finally get to Bangkok to see my connecting flight to Oslo has left. Thai schedules me on a new flight 24 hours later. I'm told to go to an hotel paid by Thai. I decide I want to take an earlyer flight the same morning. Finnair had a flight going out, but first I have to pick up my luggage. I wait for the luggage by the belt. But it doesn't arrive. I stand in line for the luggage desk. They can't find it and sends me to an Thai luggage service office at the same floor. They can't find my luggage but they can help me with a new ticket. They book me on a finnair to Oslo via Helsinki 08:55 same day and they will have my luggage. I'm good with that so I'm told to go down to 2nd floor, 5th exit, and someone from Thai will meet me there. There is no 5th exit on the 2nd floor. 1st floor has one so I go there. No one from Thai there. I go up to 4th floor to the ticket office. Wait 30 more minutes and they get a guy that follows me back down to 1st floor, 5th exit, and in to a minivan, off to the hotell. I sleep for 2 hours take a shower and head back to the airport to catch the finnair flight. I stand in the check-in line for over an hour. When I get to the desk there is a problem. They can't find my ticket. They say Thai has made a mistake and tells me to take this with Thai. I run to the Thai ticket office and they say the problem lies with finnair and that they have booked the ticket. I run back to  finnair check-in and they say Thai has made a mistake and that the flight is full. I go back to Thai ticket office, they don't know what to do so they call for someone in management. I wait in the ticket office for 55 min. A guy from a hotel shows up and sais everything is fine, come with me. This is where I get agitated. Absolutely nothing about this is fine. They tell me to go with the man and call a number they gave me. I get to the hotel and call the number. The man answering the phone cuts me off as I try to speak to him, he tells me that I have to go down to the reception and tell the them to call him up. When I ask why, he just repeats himself. So I go down to the reception and tell them to call the number. No one is answering. Turns out the Thai clerk had written down the wrong number.

I recommend Thai Airways.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Munich,May 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Bangkok to Munich. Worst experience ever. Flight was 43 mins late, so disappointing and frustrating. At the checkin I asked for a seat at the emergency exit, they told me to ask the staff at the gate. I did that, they said it was too late now, they have already given those seats to other people. I checked in 6 hours early so there's no way there were people asking for all of those seats before me. I was barely offered water or beverages in general. "

Auckland to Bangkok. Not a Thai smile in sight on our recent business class flight Auckland to Bangkok and a very poor and disorganised service experience. The whole trip was quite stressful The failure of crew to help one passenger find a correct seat - too busy chatting. Hot towels distributed twice before take off which already gave a clue as to how disorganised the crew were . Told ""run out of champagne"" after one glass as aperitif. Rushed meal service, begun with 40 mins of take off and before the aperitif was finished - and this on a 12 hour daylight flight. Meal my companion ordered was later found to be not available. I was served the wrong meal - not the one I had ordered. Second service begun more than four hours out from landing - all cabin lights on for this, then blackout again after - and barely four hours after the first service ended. On requesting a second glass of white wine (Sancerre) told ""we've run out"". No-one passing with water at any time - had to go get it or use the call button. Only one person seemed to be on duty. at any one time. Requested water bottles - told run out of those too. Had to ask for landing cards. No eye mask in amenities kit - when I asked, was given the cheapest plastic/nylon one. No fast track card distributed for immigration - simply told you just show your boarding pass, but without any instruction that this is now in the main immigration area and not in the Fast track lane And this is Business class? Yes, it was a mileage ticket - but that should not be any excuse. An opportunity missed for Thai to gain an adherent. We travel three times a year from Thailand to France and multiple times a year to the Middle East. Back to Emirates for us!"
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300 ER,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Phuket,May 2019,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,4.0,5,yes,9,  Bangkok to Phuket. A very good option for a 1 hour journey. They used a 20 year old Boeing 777 with old style business class which is fine for a 1 hr trip though my seat was struggling to move and adjust whilst seated on it. The lounge at BKK domestic is very decent and so was the food on board.

We flew at noon, were served food and a drink quite quickly, all good. Unfortunately, as soon as trays were cleared we were told to close window blinds and lights were turned off. It was lunchtime! This is unacceptable. For the next few hours if you wanted a drink you had to go and find one (in the dark) This practice is fine on a night flight but not during the day."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Krabi to Shanghai via Bangkok,April 2019,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,5,yes,8,"  I took a flight Krabi to Shanghai, connecting to Bangkok-Suvarnabhumi airport. The aircraft from Krabi to Bangkok was an A330 and the aircraft for the Shanghai leg was an A350. The aircrafts were in a good condition. I enjoyed the Airbus A350 because the cabin was quieter during take off. The Check in was fine, despite that I had to claim my bags at the connection point because I had a booking on stand by meaning that I would fly if there's space available. Fortunatly I had plenty of time to do so. The onboard service was very good. A snack was provided on the domestic leg and a full hot meal was provided on the International leg. The crew was simply great and amazing. They seemed happy to serve passengers with smiles. It was not the first time that I took Thai Airways and this time I got to enjoyed one their newest aircrafts. The only downside is that they don't fly across the Pacific to North America anymore. I won't doubt to fly again with Thai Airways if I have a chance to return in Thailand."

The price of a paid ticket on this route was about $700, and I paid 27,500 miles plus $100 in taxes. I specifically chose flights which were on their long-haul aircraft. The check in was fast, and with their gold members, Thai ask if we are satisfied with our seat selection or would prefer otherwise. Lounge located after check in not the best, but certainly not the worst. It filled up gradually. There is a 30 minute complimentary foot or back massage for business class customers. This flight was full in business. I had seat 15K which was staggered away from the aisle. I received a warm welcome by name and was asked what I would like to drink. I settled with a mimosa, and their champagne (Vevue Cliquot) has become my favourite. The service on this flight was prompt. Meal choices on the outbound were 3 chicken dishes, Thai, Western or Chinese style. I chose the Thai style which was fried rice with chicken and chinese sausage. A very authentic Thai breakfast, but the choice puzzles me. I had preordered my inbound meal, and it was a beef tenderloin steak with grilled veg and potatoes, and the beef was very tender. The seat has got to be one of the best business class seats I have experienced. It is comfortable, with a 180 degree recline, foot room is large, and there are  storage areas around the seats. One thing to be improved is that the fabric is worn out and is due for replacement. The cabin crew on these flights are some of the most warm crew I've ever met. Everything was bought out on a tray and placed at your seat. I had some really nice conversations. It  is true Thai hospitality. Entertainment is good, but Thai don't have the widest selection. Thai have some serious competition with Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific, and Thai charges some ridiculously high fares for their business class. I've got another ticket on Thai booked, but unfortunately this time it's in economy. There are little things which make up for all the bad things."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to London,April 2019,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,5.0,3,no,2,"  Bangkok to London. I have flown Thai many times over the past 26 years and although the inflight entertainment has improved considerably the rest of the service gets worse. The cabin was so hot when we were boarding people were fanning themselves with anything they could find. It didn't get better after take off. I had words with a staff member and she did eventually get the temperature a lot cooler. Then hours into the journey the plane became a fridge. I would have thought technology on a modern aircraft could keep the temperature at a reasonable level. Also on this aircraft there are no personal air vents so you are reliant on the crew knowing what they are doing. When the seat in front fully reclines there is very little room. You have to recline your own seat to focus on the TV screen. Food is absolutely terrible on Thai. 90% of the passengers are European. Rice, Thai chicken sausages and a fried egg slapped on top might be fine for Thai customers  but everyone I could see barely touched their food. Thai must throw away so much food in one flight - the only food myself and my family enjoyed was a Kit Kat in my son's goody box that Thai gave him. Cabin crew haven't improved over the years. Still poor communicators. On a positive note, check in staff were very good and efficient at Bangkok."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-500,Business,Business Class,Bangkok to Dubai,April 2019,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,3,yes,7,"  Bangkok to Dubai. The pre departure facility for Thai Airways is very good as you have an exclusive check in area with its own security and immigration which is excellent. The escalator takes you directly into the lounge and business class passengers have a fee 30 minute spa session which is again excellent and very relaxing. There was a delay of an hour at the gate which was not managed efficiently. In the flight there was no wifi working and no interactive flight maps so it was frustrating not to know the details of your flight, and a total lack of information being relayed by the captain and not a word of apology for the delay or the reason. In any case, the flight was overall good and the crew service was good. The best part was the choice of Thai meal with soup, salad, main course and dessert- all Thai cuisine."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Sydney via Bangkok,March 2019,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  Delhi to Sydney via Bangkok. The transit period was 1 hour and 30 minutes at Bangkok. The flight was delayed from India by an hour and so. When I arrived to Bangkok there was a person with the board with just written gate number on it. I noticed the gate number and tried to find the way to it. After some time I get to know which way to go. Then there were no one who can quickly do security check as My flight is about to depart. By the time I arrived on gate my flight was already departed. I went to the ticket counter they said its my mistake that I couldn’t catch flight. And if I want to catch next flight then I need to pay $372 AUD. However the initial plan was delayed it was not my fault. Then nobody notified that flight is about to depart they just told the gate number. I don’t know the way to gate it was also not my fault. There was long queue in security check and for us there were no arrangements to clear the security check quickly and reach to the gate again it was not my fault. I had to spend whole 24 hours at airport. They didn’t provide any lounge or complementary food

New A350 is a good hard product with reasonably comfortable seat and ok IFE (selection quite limited but screen and system itself good and intuitive). Unfortunately service was mediocre at best. It was a late evening flight so was happy that they skipped a full meal and gave a goodie bag with a small sandwich and water instead for those who wanted to go straight to sleep. However, during the next three hours of the flight I didn’t see a single cabin crew to offer drinks to passengers. When I went to the galley to ask for some water and ask why not a single round of service was offered, the crew’s reply was that they were getting ready to serve breakfast. Surely it doesn’t take 4h to prep breakfast so that was a very lame excuse. TG was a far cry from a 4 or 5 star experience."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Melbourne,April 2019,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4,yes,7,"  Bangkok to Melbourne. Thai Airways deploys their newest aircraft the A350 for this popular route.It's red eye at 1 am going, but a very nice 3 pm returning. 1x2x1 flat beds, with aisle access for every seat. Mandarina duck or Lacoste basic toiletry kits are given. AKG noise canceling headphones are supplied, which is of high quality. On board wifi is available, and we are given a 20 MB free connection coupon, a nice gesture. Meal services for these long haul sectors score far better than their regional ones. Crew work diligently throughout the flights. The 1 pm arrival is perfect , as Melbourne airport is very quiet at that time, making through immigration and customs was a bliss. The fast track we were given was not necessary to be used at that time. It is interesting to note that, compare to TG on their regional route, it's like a different airlines when they are doing long haul. Based on my recent experience, I can pass up on their regional flights, but their long haul is still very good."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330 / B777-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Hong Kong to Bangkok,April 2019,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,3.0,3,no,5,"  Hong Kong to Bangkok. The service and aircraft quality of this regional sector keeps dropping. For this sector, the oldest aircraft type and seats are deployed. Service is patchy, forgetful (almost forgot to serve welcome drinks), extra blankets are stored above my overhead lockets, which meant no space for my cabin bags. Crew did not hide that he was not happy that I asked to have these bundles re-located, I believe it's my basic right to have the use of that space. The meal quality has sunken to another low, everything stacked onto one tray, very mediocre in taste, and small in portion. The main course plate was 3 spoons of rice, some veggie, few tiny pieces of grilled meat. Dessert for TG nowadays are all served on a glass, regardless whatever it is. They parked the aircraft in a far away outside bay in BKK, their home ground. One bus for biz class, another 2 for economy, and the ride was quite long.  Very sad to see my once-favourite (and quite outstanding) airlines has reduced to this, making it very hard for me to choose them again."

Staff at Phuket were very helpful with our check in as we had separate tickets with a different airline the same day. Flight itself was late about 45mins. Plane was quite spacious but very old and you can really see it. However many other airlines such as Bangkok airways offer more seating on smaller planes. Snack was a small calzone and served its purpose well. Quite normal experience without anything special apart from the great ground service.
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chiang Mai to Jakarta via Bangkok,March 2019,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,5,yes,8," 
Check in at Chiang Mai was quick and security and immigration was efficient. The BKK-CGK sector was good despite the flight being more or less full. THAI operates their 777s in a 3-3-3 configuration and hasn't crammed in an extra seat like many airlines so it feels quite spacious, even in economy. As you would expect on THAI, the cabin crew was very efficient and professional - not exactly super friendly - but they got the job done. It's only a 3-hour flight but they still do a proper drinks service before serving lunch. The food was fine - they ran out of one of the options and actually made an announcement to apologise for the inconvenience - never seen that before. Arrival at Soekarno Hatta was on time. I'm only silver status on THAI but still get priority baggage handling - despite the priority tag on my case it was among the last to come out which was a bit annoying. Overall, the flight was pretty good. No complaints really."

Appalling ground service (1 hour queue to checkin, people constantly cutting the line). Web checkin/seat selection didn’t work, so there was no alternative but to wait it out. Consequently ended up with a seat in the last row of economy (despite having a flexible economy ticket). Cabin crew seemed not to be able to cope with the fact that a large number of preselected vegetarian meals were missing (and started snapping at those passengers for whom the meals were intended). "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Brisbane,March 2019,,,,,,3.0,3,no,4,"  Due to fly Bangkok to Brisbane. Massive luggage allowance, fairly direct routes, a large choice for European destinations. Free stopovers available.

✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Bangkok,March 2019,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4.0,5,yes,8," Singapore to Bangkok. First impressions were not good: when booking online with Thai, after completing the process, an online error happened and no eticket was ever received. Nonetheless, excellent service recovery from Thai, without prompting: contacted me to execute and complete booking (unfortunately leaving off my pre-booked seats in the process). Check-in staff kindly identified me an aisle seat. Boarding was organised, and seats and IFE (in the new A350) were as good as you would expect from a brand new aircraft. Legroom was adequate and there was a seat rest, headphones were provided in the seat pocket. Crew were generally friendly and refreshment service commenced almost immediately on departure, the only strange part was that drinks were only offered on the second pass of the cabin, when you had mostly finished the meal. The quality of the meal was adequate rather than pleasant, but I would guess that most shorthaul meals are of equally dubious quality. Overall, a very good flight, no doubt partly tempered by the brand new (and quiet) A350-900, which is definitely a cut above the 787 for the slightly wider seating."

Lousy IFE, noise canceling headphones where broken. Even with volume all the way up I couldn’t hear the soundtrack of the movie, good thing it was a short flight. Food and beverages served are similar what you would get on other premium airlines economy class, inedible and not even mineral water. Makes you wonder how they are always losing money when they charge more than the competition when the hard products seem really cheap."

I am an American living in Bangkok and I have been a TG gold member for many years. The food is also often inedible and they have lost my veg food order so many times I've lost count. On this flight, they had a problem with the computer and sent me home (after 6 hours in the airport), refusing to search for alternate flights on other partners. Everyone I dealt with, including the manager, was rude. The next day they held the flight for some VIPs for so long that I missed my connection. As a Gold member the program is pretty worthless since the charges for using their miles are astronomical (sometimes more than a comparable flight would actually cost plus your lost miles) and they have mostly devalued the mileage earning, making it almost impossible to achieve gold status."

Munich to Hanoi via Bangkok. Fairly good experience for the first time flying with Thai. Nice, polite and attentive cabin crew. Cute and creative safety instruction video. For a short person, I find the seat is comfy. However, instead of finding provided food tasty, I think it is just so-so. Very boring in-flight entertainment, there is nothing interesting to watch. Overall, for the price of the ticket, I am satisfied with the service. I still would like to fly with Thai in future."

Flight arrived early in Melbourne. Would definitely fly again.

Flew on their recently refitted A330-300 and was excellent for a 6.5hr flight down to Perth. I had one of their ‘throne’ seats, with heaps of storage and seat was very comfortable. Service and catering were excellent. Only disappointment was after having flown economy with Thai the previous week, I found the range of movies was pretty much the same in business too. One of the best business classes in the world, but unfortunately I would still probably avoid Thai Airways only because of how horrible Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport is. Wifi was available on the flight but I didn’t use it."

Unfortunately staff was not explaining that we have a fast track at Immigration and security check. Then as our flight was canceled due to technical issues, happens. But letting eco, business and first into a super fully crowded bus after we had to leave the aircraft, was not very nice. Arrived back at the airport they offered the lounge and some more info soon. Nothing happened, we had to approach the desk. After 3 hours in total we had our luggage back. It was a disaster and to leave the unfriendly airport service, we had to go through the immigration again filling out the form again... no one explained. Super friendly at airplane, but horrible overall how we got treated as business passengers."

However, the declined within their soft product are visible. Fare price - Thai has the highest fare compared with its competitors like China Airlines and Eva Airways. Naturally, one would expect something better, sadly not. The (+) flight arrived half an hour late into Bangkok, despite having left Taipei an hour late. The crews were pleasant but uninspired. The (-) The aircraft seemed old and in poor condition. There was no USB port in economy class (compared with EVA). The seats were worn out and hard not to notice. The headphone socket was loose and intermittent on my seat, and the entertainment system kept freezing. The in-seat lights in my row kept turning on and off on its own. I could have sworn these were the doing ghosts. The food was similar to a budget airline. Basically both the condition of the aircraft and the service was disappointing. In conclusion - compare with its competitor Eva Airways and China Airline, Thai failed on price and soft products. It is definitely not the Thai I used to love."

The plane was fairly old and showing carpet ware in seat and floor inbound and outbound.  They boarded economy class passengers through the front door making it difficult to to serve pre-flight drinks and when they did you felt like you were in a goldfish bowl being gawked at as the passengers waited to move through. 50 minutes late in departing and no explanation! Inflight my wife in 14a dropped her seat back to relax and opened up a big gap which could not be moved so she had to be moved to a spare. The supper was unbelievable with the offer potato chips and 2 little bread rolls with something inside. They said full service breakfast, so when it came just a tray with everything lashed on (a small bowl with three bread items stacked - no service) and each of 4 flights we had you were served cereal in a glass, very poor for business class. When discussing these issues with the Purser it was everyone else’s fault. When we left Australia we were on a late night flight which was cancelled, I think I know why. Over 30 odd years I have travelled with Thai many times, there are plenty of better airlines particularly at the price they charge that look after you far better."

To start with I was really fed up with Thai Airways as they had altered my return flight times. We were supposed to fly at 16.10 but it was changed to 10.00. This meant we lost valuable time with our daughter and granddaughter. We also ended up with nearly an 8 hour wait at Bangkok instead of just over 3 hours. That said we found the Thai Airways experience good. Staff friendly and nothing too much trouble. We always book middle row isle seats but these had been altered, even though we’d booked them and paid extra. I told them this and they moved us to different seats. Not overly crazy on the food and entertainment wasn’t as good as Cathay Pacific but overall a good flight."

Having just flown Heathrow to Hong Kong with Virgin Upper Class you would think the 2 hour hop across to Bangkok with Thai Airways would be a somewhat underwhelming experience, the reality was anything but. As soon as we stepped into the Royal Silk cabin it was as though the weight of the world was lifted from our shoulders and we could begin our holiday in Thailand. The staff were fantastic and genuinely there to make you flight as pleasant as possible. The Virgin staff were ok but essentially it was all about them, the Thai Airways staff were there to look after you. The cabin staff on the return leg Bangkok to Hong Kong on Jan 5th in particular were quite superb and deserve special mention. The cabin feels spacious with aisle access for all seats and is arranged in a 1-2-1 pattern. Alternate window seats have slightly better window access and are set slightly in from the aisle. The seat converts to a full flat bed but we didn't put it to the test on such a short flight. The meal BKK to HKG was a lamb massaman and actually very edible, a selection of cheeses, additional crackers were gladly provided upon asking. A couple of deserts were offered and they insisted we try both as the flight was not full so there was enough to go round. Check in at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport was relaxed and courteous with a dedicated Royal Silk international drop off zone. There were even seats for you during the check in process. Didn't particularly use the in flight entertainment system, the rest of the family managed to squeeze in a film. No qualms about recommending this flight, lasting memory would be the staff, a credit to Thai Airways."

Everything expected of Thai is delivered, good service and good catering on board for this 2 hour flight. We experienced a slight delay due to some no shows and had to off load their luggage. Everything went smoothly once we took off. I must say cost cutting is really obvious with their catering, with much smaller serving and all courses onto one tray. The rice that came with my curry were not more than say, 4 tablespoons! This is one of the very few times when the flight still feeling a little hungry. Other than that, it was a great flight."

On Momondo I selected the 7:15pm  departure and was directed to  Thai Airways website where the first listing was the 7:20am flight. I selected this flight by mistake. Two hours later, I realized I had booked the wrong flight and I called the customer service centre. I was told that the tickets were non refundable and could not be changed for another flight. I find this policy unacceptable and results in poor customer service. I am sure that if Thai Airways wanted to make this change they could. I would like to pay to transfer and pay for the more expensive evening flight. "

The flight from KL to Bangkok was fantastic and crew were so friendly and smiling. Can feel their passion in serving the customer. Though it was a 2-hour flight, they managed to serve everything smoothly until landing. Second sector was from Bangkok to Osaka. Crew were like robot. Not even ask the passengers about their choice of meal and directly give passengers whatever the meal they are holding. Crew were not seen serving drinks during the mid of the flight. No warm towel prior to take off and landing. Inflight entertainment was passable. Seat is comfort. Third sector was from Osaka to Bangkok. Some crew were very rude. Rushing for the meal and expecting the passengers to finish it quickly. Even heard a enior crew raised her voice to at least three passengers, ""Finish? Bring this go there (finger point to the back galley) I won't come back again, understand!"" The flight was six-hour long and why don't give some time for the passengers to enjoy their meals slowly. No beverage serving / crew going round the cabin with drinks in the mid of the flight. Crew takes long time to answer call bell. The same goes to the last sector. Rushing to do their service and very impatient. Few times I observed the crew can't wait to push away the cart perhaps the passengers were still thinking of what the crew were saying or couldn't listen to it clearly. For money wise, yes it's cheaper than some other airlines. In terms of inflight entertainment, it's not as interesting as SQ, EK or CX. Lavatory doesn't provide any toiletries, only a bottle of cologne."

I've flown with Thai between Bangkok and Bali in the past on a Boeing 787 and a Boeing 777-300 and both offered good service whether in economy or business class. Presently Thai have a Boeing 747-400 plying the route, so it's clearly a far from new aircraft. That manifests itself in pretty basic in-flight entertainment options where picture and sound quality is a bit iffy. However for a flight of 3 hours 45 minutes, not only is business class offered, but on the aircraft on which I flew, first-class seats were sold as business class. Oodles of space (fully flat bed if you wanted it), and typically gracious and attentive Thai cabin crew. Dinner included really tasty Thai options and the purser personally thanked passengers for choosing to fly with Thai. Plane at gate 20 minutes ahead of schedule. A very pleasant flight, and not expensive."

There was even a complementary food and water service. Now granted the food was a small ham croissant and potato/veg salad, but when you are not expecting anything this was a treat. Flight was smooth and onetime, staff was very friendly and helpful. Actually wish the flight was longer so we could enjoy ourselves on board."

I haven’t been so satisfied with my experience for quite a while in economy. I recently got my gold card upgrade. Check in was very quick and attentive. I decided to use the Lufthansa lounge, and it was surprisingly well polished! Since I got my card upgrade I used their senator lounge which is better. Boarding was quick, only about 200 people on a 507 seat airplane! I booked the upper deck economy as always. As soon as “Boarding Complete” was announced on the PA, there were 13 people in a 58 seat cabin. That meant that everyone got either a row to themselves or an extra legroom seat. I chose the former, but couldn’t sleep. Oddly enough, nobody in that cabin got any sleep on an overnight flight. The crew on this flight were astounding. As there were only 13 pax, they went around taking meal orders during boarding, and instead of wheeling the cart to our seats, she just parked the cart near the exit and gave us our trays. I also particularly liked this crew member as she had a relaxing tone whenever she spoke. She was also one of the more senior crew so that made for a great flight. I have a habit of asking for seafood meals even though I’m not pescatarian, but what really annoyed me on this flight was the fact that I was served two bowls of chopped fruit as a side dish for my breakfast, and an identical bowl for dessert for dinner. After telling the crew this, they gave me a pumpkin spice pudding and vanilla ice cream from business class. One thing that is annoying (and most airlines have this issue) is the location of the shared power sockets. They’re right behind someone else’s calf half the time, or your calf. I would definitely prefer them to be in between the seats as there is no awkwardness in trying to get your phone charged. Thai’s seats on the A380 are one of the most comfortable economy seats out there in my opinion. Legroom is fine, and there is a large footrest that is highly appreciated on long flights. But the most comfortable economy seat goes to their 747. Massive 34’ pitch and a very wide seat as well. Too bad these aircraft are being phased out. Upon arrival, My baggage was one of the first fifty bags to come out, and baggage delivery speed wasn’t too bad. To conclude, I have had many happy flights with Thai, and have clearly gained trust with them. Their flights are seldom delayed except for late departures due to short turnaround times. But they still arrive on time! Speaking of which, on my outbound from Bangkok, they said that the delay was due to “late arrival of inbound aircraft” when clearly the plane arrived on schedule from Paris."

On the positive side the flight left on time and arrived a few minutes early. Apart from that things weren't so good. They ran out of beer during the initial drinks service, I don't know how they can run out so early into the flight. The aircraft seemed  old and in poor condition, many of the seats wouldn't recline, the foot rest was broken on the seat next to me, the headphone socket was loose and intermittent on my seat, and the entertainment system kept freezing. The first meal was decent but no choice for the second meal and no snack offered in between meals. They came round with drinks twice (apart from with the meal service). Basically both the condition of the aircraft and the service was disappointing."

Very nice aircraft with a biz class in a 1-2-1 configuration (same seat model as Iberia is providing on their long-range aircrafts). Seat comfort excellent, nice but a little rushed service (hot Asian breakfast), maybe due to the delayed departure of 45 minutes). Lounge at CNX is now (after renovations) back in the area after security control.

Nine of the twelve 1st class seats were occupied; nevertheless very quiet atmosphere. Flawless service, premium wine list (although smaller compared to competitors, ice cold vodka served with the caviar, wide and tasty range of Asian and Western food options (I was opting for the Asian dishes). Very comfortable seat and swiftly made bed and a lovely Thai styled pyjamas. Very little that Thai should review on service and hardware: 1) night temperature too high (guess a question to what temperature you are used too sleep); 2) WiFi connectivity limited to 20MB per flight (should be without limits or much higher limits) and 3) hard and software of the entertainment system not anymore up to competitors (screen too small and not enough responsive). Probably rather fault of FRA airport and not Thai airways: no greet and meet at the incoming connecting flight (as I was told due to a late change of arrival gate) and chaotic boarding procedures at B gates (mostly due to the restricted space there). In a summary a very nice but not yet perfect flight experience!"

I have wanted to fly Thai Airways for a long time and even though this was a short flight, it was a big let down. Tired old business class seats, angled and very uncomfortable in any position. A special meal not loaded, and with very little apologies. Was served a disgusting meal which consisted of 5 stale bread rolls and a packaged curry with no rice.

If passengers had insisted to fly, they must have waited until 11 pm. The airline didn’t suggest us to change to the next flight because of limited available seats. Fortunately, I ran to the booking office and changed to the next flight immediately. Many passengers decided to refund money and bought a new ticket from other airlines. Sadly, many passengers who didn’t know these solutions have to wait until 11 pm. Some passengers who changed flights couldn’t find their baggage because the airline told them there weren’t staffs. I have to check in again. Very long line and very slow because they cannot solve any passengers problems from this flight. I told call center but she told me that she cannot help because it is the ground staff duty. After I checked in, My seat number is 58A. When I was on board, there aren’t 58th row. Six passengers including me have no seats.  Air hostesses always smile when they show how to use inflight equipment only not during providing service onboard. And check in staff never smile as well."

Bangkok to Manila flight was just as smooth, we were served breakfast that was hearty. IFE was sufficient for a short flight (3 hours).

It made of a good material and be designed by Naraya - a famous Thai design souvenir brand. The entertainment system is just standard (good enough but not special). The touchscreen is a bit as lag but not too bad. The most wonderful thing is the catering. The snack was mixed nuts and dried fruits came with soft drinks or your favorite wines. I recommend tamarind iced tea (signature drink of TG). There are 3 choices of main course to be chosen. Certainly, Thai food must be selected. It was very very delicious. The cabin crew who took care of me was a mid-age lady. She was very polite and service-minded. She always asks for my need and offers many things along the route.

I apologized and assured her that I won't include the staff. One of the stewardess was serving the second round of drinks and just passed by me. So I had to ask her for a cup of drink, so I can reserve it for meal time which they were also about to serve. The same stewardess who advised me about my filming was serving the meal in our section, where she asked me if I wanted to have ""fish"" or ""chicken"". I opted for a fish, however, there is no more available in her trolley. And so, she told me that she will just get one in the galley. And I  waited and waited, I didn't call her attention at first because I was under the impression that she will serve me my fish, after she is done serving everyone. Until such time, she was serving coffee, that I had to ask for my fish.  She then gave me my fish and sincerely apologized for the lapse."

Checking in at Sydney they had one person only serving economy passengers. Seeing there would be 250+ economy passengers it certainly took awhile to get to the front of the line. They did eventually have 3 staff as I got closer to the front of the que, but they sure took there time getting through the economy passengers. Getting on the plane was great they boarded from back to front, the only high light on my journey. We leave the gate and get to the end of the runway to hear an announcement from the captain that we are returning to the gate as there is a tech issue. He tells us it should take 20mins, it takes an hour.  The service on board was very average. Very slow and when the meal cart came along I asked for beef as I didn't want the chicken to be told there is no option. Again, I understand and take the chicken. It was so hot with spices and curry I didn't finish it. The rest of the flight was just ok. Rarely saw the flight attendants. Very average IFE. I had a blanket on me and staff didn't check and see it I had my belt on. Also on both flights the cabin was so humid. I have never been on such a hot aircraft before. That's for both the 747 and A380. There are no air vents on either aircraft. The seats felt so uncomfortable that your backside hurts. When we arrived at Bangkok we didn't go to a terminal and had to climb down stairs in the rain and get on buses to transfer to terminal.  All in all I would not choose Thai again. From there lack of cabin service to a flight delay (on the way home they changed us to another 747 in Bangkok as the first one was grounded due to another tech issue and we fly home on the 747 we arrived on with the tech issue in Sydney, we had to again climb up stairs, thankfully no rain this time)."

After having checked in for my flight from Lahore to Bangkok, I was waiting at the gate for the departure. Shortly before the scheduled departure time of 11:40pm an announcement was made informing passengers that the flight departure time had been delayed until 1:30am. At this time no explanation was given as to why this was happening (or if it was it wasn’t communicated in English). After the announcement I spoke to a Thai ground staff member and she told me that the flight had been delayed due to bad weather and had been rerouted to Amritsar, India. I understand that adverse weather occurs from time to time and that all airlines are governed by strict rules regarding how many hours the pilot and cabin crew are allowed to fly. I was however angry and disappointed at how the situation was handled by ground staff. Updates in the form of passenger announcements were minimal. Instead passengers had to search for Thai representatives to find out what was going on. Information was inconsistent and misleading: the plane was delayed due to bad weather; we would be leaving soon; we would not be leaving soon; the plane was delayed due a technical issue; the plan was delayed due to administrative problems in Amritsar. The lack of accurate information just added to the feelings of uncertainty and confusion. The main Thai Airways representative dealing with the situation was out of his depth. At many times during the evening he was surrounded by a mob of angry and confused passengers desperate to know what was going on. The representative tried to maintain his composure but at times raised his voice, including at me, this was extremely unprofessional. The real problems began when the flight was eventually cancelled, and the airline begrudgingly arranged accommodation for the passengers. There was no clear procedure, and nobody knew what was going on. Thai Airways took a situation that was very stressful and made it even more so. There was no clear procedure. Instead staff were constantly on their mobile phones telling customers to “wait a few minutes.” This continued for a couple of hours. Ironically it was the passengers, not the Thai Airways staff, who were most supportive of each other. Everyone was so confused. It really was survival of the fittest. People didn’t know where to go, and some instances gave up altogether. This chaos could have been so easily curtailed in so many ways: information on the loudspeaker system; a point person to explain the procedure; staff holding signs. In all my many years of travelling this was by far the worst experience. It was one of the worst nights of my life."

This was my first time flying with Thai Airways. And I'm really satisfied with their service, and value for my money."

The first leg from Manila to Bangkok was excellent, I preordered Seafood Meal which is the best option to go with as you get your meal the first before anybody else. The service was great, I always ordered 2 gin tonic and was never refused. Just the service I like, warm, hearty service. Then the second leg from Bangkok to Vienna was disappointing. Only mediocre service when service at all, staff was not present. When asked for a drink I got a response that only one alcoholic drink per time. Maybe because it was a red eye flight there was not the always present service.  Seafood meal just awesome, shrimp based both times. Also the smoked salmon entrée wasn't disappointing. There were many cabin crew and when I asked for a drink I even had to go back to the kitchen with them instead of getting it served while watching a movie.  However, a 4 star experience all in all because the flights were on time and the entertainment system was very good."

Food is way better and suits my taste better than going to Hanoi via other airlines. IFE new hollywood movies were there, which was really nice, but just the aircraft was older so the touchscreen did not respond really well but they are replacing it with Boeing 787 which is really beautiful aircraft.

Thai Airways Royal Silk in 777-200 is relatively old although the service is great providing everything Business Class passengers need. The food is great, Samrab Thai which is Salmon with coconut sauce and rice. The Royal Silk check-in counters had a very minimal number of persons and the check-in process is quick. Expedited immigration for Thai Airways premium travellers is a big thumbs up. The lounge offers decent amount of food selection. The IFE system can be improved though it is fine for a 3 hour flight"

Massive economy class which thankfully on the outward leg was about three quarters full leaving a spare seat beside me in the middle row aisle seat. So grateful that the considerate lady in front of me didn't recline her seat the whole flight. The return journey was not as good. Night flight so looking forward to some rest before my 07:00 arrival at Heathrow. Unfortunately a full flight. The row of 4 in front of me was occupied by a mother, father and two small children who thought it would be great to simulate a camping holiday by draping the supplied blankets across the tops of the seats and supplying their offspring with led torches which they persisted in shining throughout the night keeping all other passengers awake. They reclined all 4 seats meaning it was impossible to use the tray table for eating or viewing the screens. They ignored any polite request to create room for eating. Why do 3-4 year olds need fully reclined seats for 12 hours - just inconsiderate to the rest of the passengers. "

Compared to our outbound leg reviewed previously, the 1st sector on an aging Boeing 747  was a trip of a bygone era. It brought back memories on what is was like flying 40 years ago – with service to match! What a difference the cabin crew can make. Boarding in Munich was orderly. We were seated in row 68JK. After take-off , drinks were offered quickly followed by tasty  meals. The very personable Cabin Crew in our area of the aircraft continually made an appearance offering water and drinks. Nothing was too much of a problem. Seats were comfortable and with generous leg-room. There were about 80 seats vacant on this flight so my wife was able to stretch out and get some sleep. Special praise to a female cabin crew member and to male who I thought that their in-flight service was exemplary – and restored my faith in Thai Airways and wanting to travel with them again - after a less than favorable flight reviewed earlier. Flight departed on time, arrived early and was very smooth. We departed the aircraft feeling valued customers. The overnight sector TG 475 BKK/ SYD on a 747 and seated in a similar area was again a most pleasant flight where we had great views of the lights of some major cities, was able to get some sleep and the meals were sufficient and tasty. Flying on the B747 is rapidly coming to an end. It will be a sad day when these comfortable aircraft with ample seat pitch disappear from our skies."

SYD-MXP BOEING 747-4 / A350–900. Flight on B747 seated in bulkhead seats to BKK although nothing special – was a pleasant flight. Good legroom, edible food and attentive cabin crew. I remember that boarding in Sydney was a little ‘chaotic’. Flight TG 940 was on a A350-900 from BKK to MXP and was something I was looking forward to flying on for the 1st time. Can’t understand all the hype about this aircraft. I thought it was noisy (even compared to a aging 747), the seats in row 61 were decidedly uncomfortable offering very little under thigh support, I could feel the seat frame through the hard cushion, entertainment system not user friendly and problematic. Frankly, we were glad to get out of the seats in Milan. Thai meals tried to appease the Italians on board and were a dismal failure - not Thai food nor anything else. My Thai wife was in tears in not being able to eat the food on offer on her national airline. I was hungry during the night and went to the galley to ask for a snack - no snacks or fruit. Cabin crew less than impressive – I noted that before take-off - when instructed to arm doors and ‘cross check’ – that 2 of the crew I could see did not cross check. Cabin crew made themself scarce during the night – not coming around to give out water or juice. They never asked passengers anywhere that I could see - to put their seat back upright during meal times - necessitating us requesting those in front to do so . Seat belt sign on during turbulence but people still wandered off to the toilet without crew intervention. The 2nd sector of this trip was memorable for all the wrong reasons as it was and not what we were expecting from Thai. At least we departed and arrived safely on-time."

Both flights departed on time. 1-2-1 layout on both aircraft. The seats were comfortable and extended into fully flat beds. The mattress was an added bonus that added to the comfort of the 'bed'. The cabin on the first flight (CPH-BKK) was a little too warm. The service was outstanding and the menu choices were extensive and excellent. However, I did not eat the breakfast on the first flight due to a lack of appetite. The A350 was the superior of the two aircraft. It was much newer and it had a more spacious layout with a higher ceiling. It had lower humidity and quieter engine noise. The mood lighting was more relaxing. The free WIFI voucher (for the first 100mb) given out on the A350 (BKK-MEL) proved to be useless as it kept on going round and round in circles. It asked me to keep on logging in to the plane's WIFI even though I was already logged in. I gave up and watched a couple of movies. The IFE on both flights worked well but choices were limited. Overall, two excellent flights and good value for money. The lounge in Bangkok was excellent and the shower was greatly appreciated. I will fly with Thai again."

I had to catch this specific flight so I ran as hard as I could and managed to transfer within 15 mins. The plane shut the door as soon as I got on board and departed. Upon arrival, my baggage was left behind in Bangkok. Next flight was ~9 hours time. The staff in Bangkok provided false information. If I had missed this flight I would have had to spend the night in Bangkok. Bag was suppose to arrive at the place I was residing at 9:00pm (14 hours after arriving in Seoul).

I had never flown long-haul before so had some reservations beforehand but I found it a better experience than I expected. I'm fairly tall but I had enough legroom in both planes. The cabin crew were efficient and we got served plenty of food and drink which was of a high quality. In-flight entertainment was good - I watched 5 movies and a number of TV shows. No problems with our baggage either. We had a 2 night stop-over in Bangkok on the return flight and I left my camera on board the plane. When we got back to Perth a couple of days later I phoned the local office of Thai Airways and they could not have been more helpful. They said they could see what they could do to help me recover my camera. They phoned me about a week later saying they were still looking, and then the next day phoned to say they had found it and would I like to pick it up from their Perth office or the airport. I chose the airport and got it back the next day. And I wasn't charged a cent!"

Bangkok - Munich plane was a bit older than the other flight. Crew members who served the area I was sitting, were a bit unfriendly. Asked if I could have a croissant for breakfast as my chosen meal was without (got just a scrambled egg with potatoes that I didn’t eat) after they finished serving all passengers. They looked at me and said Empty, but I could  see that they had croissants in the baskets left (I was sitting next to the kitchen). "

Part of the Turkish airlines ticket from Europe to New Zealand, this was quite disappointing. Thai is behind the industry standards when it comes to economy product : old entertainment with poor selection of films and small monitors, catering average with the cheapest plastic, no amenity. Despite not being very old their Boeing 772 look very tired. Cabin crew nice, however some crew quite robotic. A lot of better options now around to choose from. I really had better expectations. On a positive side: both flights on time."

Generally high quality of service, great business class amenity kits. Nice Bangkok business lounges with great shower experience.  On B787 Thai Airways saved on the video monitors so it is not adjusting to the front seat reclining position. It makes the overnight flight horrible in terms of the entertainment - you can't see the picture good enough. The transit from international to domestic flights in the Bangkok Airport is very crowded, long and disorganized. Inconsistency with crew. On Brisbane-Bangkok-Phuket-Bangkok sectors we had great crews with very attentive flight attendants but on a Bangkok-Brisbane sector crew have been inattentive, not friendly and not trying to be welcoming."

As soon as I reached Bangkok airport for changeover flight to Phuket, not a single staff was there to actually help me with the changeover or guide me regarding the next process which was visa on arrival, as it was my first international trip these guys kept telling me you will get assistance on ground. Though no one was present to guide. While returning back through the same airlines, again I landed at the same airport for changeover. Though ground staff was present this time, but she guided me in the wrong direction which created unnecessary confusion. On raising this issue with Thai Airways, he was so adamant and so rude that he said it's ok since you were able to make it. What if I would have missed my flight because of their staff inefficiencies? Staff on the flight were rude, just after one glass of whisky he ignored when asked to refil the glass. After more than 20 minutes on raising the issue to more than 3 staff, the glass got refilled. One of the worst airlines I have traveled through in recent times. Domestic airlines are far better in customer service than Thai Airways."

✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Tokyo NRT,April 2018,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,5,yes,10," Bangkok to Tokyo NRT. I chose Thai airways based on the aircraft type (a380) and price. I bought three tickets for my family, and we paid extra to sit in the upper deck. Check in was a complete nightmare, the queue at Bangkok airport spanned about 200 metres, luckily we already checked in online and the bag drop counter had a waiting time of only 10 min. Unfortunately the lady who attended to us was quite impolite and we had better experiences in the past. Boarding was an absolute nightmare, people just kept flowing in. Although we were the first of the economy passengers we didn’t get in quickly. The flight attendant at the main door is polite, and welcomes me onboard. I have to walk all the way to the back of the plane and then take the rear stairs. There is a huge amount of storage on the upper deck. You’ve got side bins, and the overhead bins aren’t like the 747 bins, they’re quite big. This flight to Tokyo was quite full, with the premium cabins having a 100% load factor. We took off, and service started with a cocktail snack and a drinks service. Strangely, on the upper deck, both aisles are served by the same cart, starting with the left side. Since it’s only 7 rows I didn’t mind. Breakfast was a choice of fish or omelette, I chose the fish and it was a very big portion of snapper accompanied by Japanese rice, which was very good. My seat mate didn’t finish her omelette entree, so it’s a hit or miss! The seat itself is comfortable, I had the front row so it was a comfortable flight. Entertainment wasn’t too good, choices are slightly lacking. WiFi is a rip off, as $34 for 100MB of data is way too expensive if you compare it to airlines like Finnair who charge less for the entire flight. An hour before landing, ice cream is distributed. We had one go around during landing, and after landing, I passed customs in a breeze, but the baggage claim wait was a nightmare. It took approximately 30 minutes for one bag. On the return trip, the bag drop looked so long, so we did something unusual: We went to the United counter and asked them to print boarding passes for us, And it worked! We did have to ditch a flip knife though, as we didn’t check any baggage. Boarding was really efficient as they sorted out the passengers by zone at the gate. This flight, I was surprised to know that the purser and three other flight attendants were from my previous outbound flight! Unfortunately, on this flight, I didn’t have a bulkhead seat, and it wasn’t as good as the first flight, but still okay, since I was on the upper deck. The food on this flight was pretty good, and service was similar to the outbound. The difference was that on this flight, there was a self serve drinks counter in the galley. On this flight, I decided to ask for some business class food, and they gave me two to try, and both were pretty delicious. They were also nice enough to plate the food like they would serve it to a business passenger! The landing in Bangkok was surprisingly loud as we may have landed on a groove. The captain of this flight was kind enough to be standing in front of the first class section and said goodbye to every passenger. This flight was very worth the money, as it was quite cheap, and I was able to book extra legroom seats free of charge. I already booked another flight with thai, and I’m hoping I could survive 12 hours in the same seat! I would highly recommend Thai if they are cheap."

Pilots kept us informed during the fight about the expected turbulence, and all the relevant information about my fight. The aircraft cabin was very clean and comfortable, amazing temperature (not too cold or too hot). Food was delicious, tasty and different options were available.

I have always been reluctant to fly Thai Airways in Business for a number of reasons, but this time has proven to be something different. The business class cabin crew introduced themselves to us and greeted us by name. The service has also become more personalised in many ways from no longer putting food on the tray all the way to frequently (almost every half hour) attending passengers who were not sleeping during those times where most of the passengers were asleep. Apart from an immensely improved soft product, the seats on this particular equipment is new. The seat reclined into a full flatbed where you can really get a sleep. Thai now provides you with one pillow, one extra pillow for lumbar support and an extra padding for sleeping. The IFE was also very responsive and the inflight WiFi which all business passengers were given 10MB trial for free was also quite fast. Overall, a pleasant surprise, over my last Business Class trip with Thai Airways 1.5 years ago. I am now really considering them for long haul flights again, given that the equipment is new."

PP750 for drinks [including alcohol] and snack type food. Free wifi. All in all a quiet oasis in a noisy uncomfortable terminal - recommend it. Told to go to gate and had to queue for over 30 minutes. Boarding was stop start. The IFE wasn't working. The food was really spicy and I couldn't eat it. Free wine and spirits. Eventually arrived 30 minutes late into Bangkok; bused to the main terminal. At least there is a benefit to that as not far to walk to immigration. Took advantage of the fast track service from BFS Premium Services.

I am puzzled why Thai airways have a habit of changing the aircraft closer to the flight date. This time the plane was down-graded from an A380 to a 747-400.  We had the unpleasant experience with this rude  male chief flight attendant. Our seats were 23A-B so we left our hand-carry items in the overhead compartment that was labelled as that. Then rude attendant telling us that we should be putting our belongings in the next compartment instead. The funny thing is that this compartment was not even labelled and how will we know that this compartment was meant for us? Relocating our belongings was not an issue for us but the tone of this attendant was off putting.  I thought cabin crews are meant to assist passengers when needed? Very bad to see such individuals as it really destroyed the whole flight experience for us.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Bangkok,March 2018,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,2,no,1,"  We chose to fly Thai Airways direct to BKK over the BA flight on the same route largely due to seeing the favourable reviews and ratings for economy class. With Thai tickets being slightly more expensive than BA at the time, we thought the extra cost would be worth it. It really wasn't. Our flight was delayed due to bad weather, which of course can happen, but the 1 hour we waited for our plane to depart we were unable to access the entertainment. It didn't become available until about 30-40 minutes into the flight. None of the March entertainment that we'd seen advertised was available on our flight, and we were flying on the 17 March! We were disappointed to find no vegetarian meal available. We had not pre-ordered this, and there was no option to pre-order through the app. I have now tried reaching the airline through their live chat, but have received no replies to my request. We also had problems with the check in process at LHR and the bag drop queues were long and slow."

Tried to book my tickets with 2 different banks, 3 different cards and several times of trying, every time my payment was rejected. Therefore I couldn't book the promo ticket anymore on the return date that I chose first. I contacted my banks and they both said there was no problem on their side at the time of payment. Thai Airways doesn't take any responsibility in solving this problem although it is impossible that the payment problem was on our side."

I had a wonderful safe flight from Bangkok to Taipei. Crew members provided an excellent service. Pilots kept us informed during the fight especially because in Taipei the weather conditions were quite bad. The aircraft cabin was clean and comfortable, food was delicious, tasty and different options were available. Duty free products are many, cheap and nice: great opportunities for shopping. Seat is very comfortable, clean with lots of space for the legs. The flight was on time, inflight entertainment is very good, varied and interesting."

Fast check in at airport (given priority because of having a walking stick); didn't have the seat that I had previously reserved because it was a different aircraft but given the equivalent seat. Boarding started a little late but was efficient and fast. Flight was a little late leaving and with headwinds ended up being almost 30 minutes late into Bangkok. Luggage was available by the time I had cleared Immigration. Flight was uneventful, there was a reasonable selection of films. Lunch was served and there was a choice of meals. Cabin crew were friendly without being in your face."

While it was a perfectly adequate flight, from this (24 hours of flying) experience, Thai airways is 3 star, not 4 star. There was nothing bad about it, it's just that it wasn't good. The food was average, there was entertainment but not a huge range, the seats were fine but not that large, the one time I needed an attendant it took me five minutes to track one down. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Beijing to Bangkok,December 2017,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3,no,1,"  We flew to Beijing with Swiss and connected onto Thai Airways flight to Bangkok 90 mins later. Delayed luggage, our plane arrived in Bangkok at 11:05 AM. One Backpack with the clothes of me and my son was missing. No problem - that happens! So we bought some short trousers, swimming trunks, t-shirts and thongs for the day - till the luggage arrives (290 US$ for 6 items). The luggage arrives at night time. In Thai regulations you can read. ""Timely Delivery of Baggage THAI commits to make every reasonable effort to return any Mishandled (delayed) baggage hours within 24 Customers must report any missing baggage upon arrival and in writing in order for THAI to commence baggage tracking. If you have expenses Because of baggage delay and are eligible to receive compensation, we will compensate you for reasonable and Necessary out-of-pocket expenses."" We did all these things and now Thai airlines writes that they did the delivery what within 24 hours so They don't have to pay anything. We like Thai Airways, but we don't understand why they make a new regulation! "

This was the first time using I've used Thai Airways for many years as I usually travel with Emirates. Firstly the good. As a first class passenger you get a choice of Star Alliance lounges at the airport including Uniteds flagship Global alliance lounge. This IMHO is by far the best lounge. Boarding was a breeze and the FAs welcome you on board with offerings of Champagne (Dom Perignon) and other soft drinks. Whilst not an enclosed cabin such as Emirates or Etihad the position of the seating means you do have some privacy from other passengers. Service on board was very good though mechanical. I did have to ask for vodka to go with the caviar. On the airlines stated previously the FA would ask if you wanted it. First world problems! There is no dine on demand either. The screen isn't as big as Emirates and seems further away but the entertainment package was fairly good and kept me occupied for most of the flight. On landing at BKK there is a buggy waiting to take you the to the Diplomatic fast track immigration counter, once through you are met again by ground staff who will then get your bag from the carousel for you. The service was exceptional and more akin to that of a VIP passenger The bad. Not a lot really. I found the bed not particularly comfortable but then I'm picky and the onboard service isn't as polished as Emirates but given that Thai was a lot cheaper its certainly one of the better FC airlines. One major issue is that you get very little free WIFI (10meg if I remember correctly) and then have to pay a Kings ransom for more data. In today's connected age and given the cost of the flight I would of expected this to be offered free of charge as other middle-eastern airlines do.. On the whole I recommend Thai's FC offering."

The cabin crews are very helpful and nice. Thai airways always give you a welcome service on board, so polite and always smile. Foods was fine, warm and tasty. However, the aircraft is quite old. I search for the information about that aircraft and found that its age is around 20 year. However, there is no tear on the seats but you would find some stains on the seat. the leg room and seat width are standard for economy class. The entertainment display is a bit small and low-resolution display because it is an old aircraft. Everything is good. Strength : warm service, nice and helpful crews. Weak : pricey ticket fare, old aircraft"

Our dog can be temperamental with strangers, so it was critical for us to bring her as excess baggage on our flight when we were relocating from Thailand to Portugal. When we booked our flights, the booking agent at the Thai Airways Corporate offices told us that a dog up to 40kg (animal and crate) would be $750 USD to transport her as excess baggage to Europe. The agent’s quote was consistent with the Thai Airways Pet Travel policy found on their website. We arrived at Chiang Mai International Airport on Christmas Day with Tam, and all of our belongings approximately 2½ hours before our flight. We provided the ticketing agent with the printed reservation confirmation (including all of the updates) that had been provided to us by the booking agent at the Corporate Offices. When we checked in, we had other issues regarding our baggage and associated fees but that is secondary to what followed. We loaded Tam (crate and all) onto the luggage scale and the total weight was 39.8 kg. Shortly thereafter, the ticketing agent told us that Tam could not travel with us on our flight because she was over 32kg. This was in direct contradiction to what the Thai Airways website says, as well as our reservation confirmation that we made in person at Thai Airways Corporate office in Chiang Mai. There we stood at the Thai Airways counter on Christmas day, after months of preparation, checking and double-checking that we had complied with all of the travel and export requirements, ensuring that the 40kg. weight limit was allowed and documented on our booking confirmation, in total disbelief. We spent 2 hours at the ticketing counter dealing with an agent who seemed entirely indifferent about the circumstances. The only explanation that she was able to provide was “Bangkok not accept”. We had to ask for a supervisor and eventually the highest person in charge for Thai Airways at the airport. After speaking with the Supervisor and being told once again that Tam could not fly with us, the Duty Manager eventually came down and told us that the booking agent in the Corporate Offices should not have made the reservation for our dog. On 2 January, I sent a lengthy email to three Directors at Thai Airways describing our experience. Several days later I received an email confirmation from Thai Airways Customer Relations Dept. that they received my email and would be conducting an investigation into our situation. On 10 January, I sent a follow-up email about our case. On 12 January I received an email from the Chief of the Customer Relations Svc. Dept. regarding the investigation that they completed on our case. In the Chief’s response, she acknowledged that Thai Airways Staff at CNX was in the wrong and should have accepted our dog on our flight, but she indicated that because we were given additional baggage allowance (as a gesture of goodwill) that there was nothing further Thai Airways would do for us. On  12 January another email was directed to Customer Relations, the Chief,  Directors and  VP's. In it I expressed that while we appreciated the gesture, including the additional bags was a soft cost to Thai Airways and that it surely did not compensate for their error. I also highlighted that bringing Tam on our flight as excess baggage was the single most important factor in selecting Thai Airways. As 01/18 I have heard nothing further from Thai Airways."

Boarding at Bangkok was a bit disorganised and we departed one hour late due to 'short flight time' - the crew was efficient and polite but not particularly friendly and there was no attempt made to personalise the service. About 1 hour after take off a crew member asked me if I would change seats from 12A to 12K so that a family could sit together - I reluctantly agreed and the crew stood and watched as I made 4 trips through the galley with my drinks, nuts, books, gadgets, carry on luggage etc - not one offered to give me a hand. The catering was fine although nothing out of the ordinary. The seat was comfortable enough and there's plenty of space to spread out. The IFE is poor - way below what you'd get on SQ or Emirates - even Malaysia Airlines is better in this regard. They gave out a 5mb free wifi card - paid wifi is really expensive. Overall it was just OK."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Brisbane to Bangkok,January 2018,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,2.0,2,no,3,  Brisbane to Bangkok. Thai Airways is not a premium airline in my opinion.

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Incheon via Hong Kong ,December 2017,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,4.0,1,no,5," Flew Bangkok to Incheon via Hong Kong. Thai Airways is known for its service. I believe they certainly achieved the service. The cabin crew's service was beyond 'nice'. They were willing to help at any given time, and when I informed the crews that the restroom was a bit dirty, (because somebody decided to throw the toilet paper to the toilet and flush it) they rushed in to clean after saying 'thanks for informing us'. I really loved how they handled that issue without any frustration. Brilliant work ethics were shown there. The aircraft itself made me think like 'well, cabin crews deserve a better plane than this!'. Seat was very uncomfortable because of the metal box that was sitting under the seat in front of me - and my seat wasn't the only seat where I could see those fixed-metal boxes and I was (by the way, I'm not that tall, I'm only 1.78m) forced to spend the most of the flight with one leg stretched all the way, and another crammed in. Only positive I can think of is the fact that the seat formation was 3-3-3 instead of 3-4-3. However, the reason why I gave 1 star in seat comfort is because I would've given a 0 if this 777 was 3-4-3! That metal box is very annoying, so be sure to check your seat before you book your seat. IFE wasn't good. Not only were the contents missing, but display itself was a mess. My eyes started hurting after 2 minutes of movie watching, and I couldn't see anything from the movie properly. If I had an option to not have IFE and not have the prementioned iron box thing, I would probably choose not to have IFE. (It was that miserable). That's the reason why I gave a 1 in IFE. Food was good except for the fact that one option ran out. That's the mere reason why I gave four on that category. Well, I wouldn't recommend you to fly this airline if you have alternatives like Emirates, Singapore Airlines, etc if you're flying 777-300. If your flight is with the relatively newer fleet, then you might take a risk, but I wouldn't advise that, as Singapore and Asiana were cheaper that time, but I decided to take a risk and got the 773. To conclude, my flight to Incheon was not good. The service was perfect, but the fleet wasn't."

Priority immigration and security at Bangkok is a godsend. One drawback is that it is obvious Thai has cut back on their catering. I miss the sumptuous cheese platters. The  lounge they use in Taipei now is a real drag, very poor food and drink selection (not that their old lounge was any better)."

After take off a full dinner (with electrical candles) is served on this flight. Breakfast served on this flight before landing in FRA and you can choose your own breakfast in the evening. The seats for business class are very comfy since you get full leg room width which give you much more freedom in movement during sleep. The screen is huge (approx. 17 inch). The remote control is a tough screen type. There are 2 type of seating at TG for the A380. The new one is slightly better with better remote control. Some how the floor is very noisy during the night when staff are moving around. The amenity kit is okay. The headphone set for long haul is a noise cancelling type and is very good.

There's no way to communicate with THAI after 5pm and on week ends and when calling the New Zealand customer service they were not able to help me. I was redirected to Bangkok where they weren't able to help me. The only answer I got was to cancel the flight and buy a new one. I have never seen such lack of customer service.

This they announced 10 minutes past the official boarding time. So I left the lounge, which is temporarily before security, and was not in the mood to go back. The first and only announcement from the gate agent was that the flight was delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft.  Then no further announcements. Shortly before the new departure time projected on the screen, I could watch the crew leaving the the aircraft for a break. Still no information. On board the crew admitted that we were delayed due to incoming connecting passengers. The flight itself was eventless and the business cabin quite empty. Old layout with 170 degree recline, but comfortable for a short domestic flight. After all I was very sorry not to have take the Thai Smile flight in economy plus, as they are more punctual. You do not get any Star Alliance miles credited, but they are about 30%-35% cheaper. So this was probably my last flight with Thai Airways when flying domestic in Thailand. "

Thai is a good airline but is let down for Business travellers by the connecting airport in Bangkok. At the departure gate for my two outbound flights there was no separate security queue for premium passengers, and there was no separate boarding queue either (you have to fight your way to the front of the general boarding queue). The lounge I used at Bangkok was very crowded. The airport is poorly signposted and the strange layout means there are very long walks from gate to gate via the security checkpoint. Security staff, both at the security check-point and again at the departure lounge, didn't seem to have heard about the famous Thai Smile. On board I found the seats comfortable on all three aircraft types, though the B777 doesn't give you the same privacy as the A380 and A350. The crew were smiling, polite and friendly. My vegetarian meals were pleasant and varied. The flights operated on time. At the other boarding points (Melbourne and Narita) Thai uses the Air NZ and United lounges respectively, which were both more pleasant than Thai's own lounge at Bangkok, though at Narita the food and drink choices were limited. At Melbourne and Narita a priority boarding queue was in operation."

This flight was purchased between 3.30-4.00pm for a 720 pm take off on the in the same date of flight, the flight was delayed two times and thus caused me to miss my connecting flight on a different Jet Airways ticket to Mumbai. At the first onset of delay I notified the flight crew that I had a connecting flight and they assured me there would be no problem due to this 20 minute delay and I would be able to make my flight. Then there was a second delay and I got really nervous, I again went to speak with the flight crew at the boarding gate and one lady reacted very poorly shouting and ranting to cancel my flight because I would not be able to make it, this made me very nervous so I asked for the supervisor, she said I may not be able to make the connection but she would notify Jet Airways and the ground crew. When we landed 45 minutes late, no one was alerted to help.  The staff was completely unhelpful, eventually the duty manager came and he said it was my fault that I didn't have enough time to make the connecting flight. Jet Airways said Thai Airways needed to send an email about the delay and the problem could have been resolved. It was a horrible experience,."

Would not fly with Thai Airways again based on their low and inflexible baggage allowance. Despite numerous bags ahead of me being underweight I wasn’t allowed even a kilo extra weight.

Great aircraft with 1-2-1 configuration, comparable you find on Alitalia or Iberia. So seat very comfortable in any position. The only setback on that seat is the table that restricts you more than others in your possible seating positions. Awfully long boarding with busses at far away stand. Nevertheless they started just 30 minutes before take off time and as I had priority boarding I was one of the first on board. We were the leaving after an hour. They announced that the delay is due to the long ground transport procedure, but last entering passengers where connecting from international flights, which is shown with yellow stickers they need to wear to pass immigration at the end destination. So I guess the connecting passengers where us delaying in the end! Flight itself ok, but they did not distribute any headphones on the short flight (1h 10 min) so I could not really enjoy other entertainment than route map. Food and service on the flight good."

Their inflight entertainment is awesome. I've tried other few airlines in past few years but i prefer Thai Airways service and food, now i came back to Thai airways for good. The only one downside on my flight to Bangkok was that they ran out of thai food option. Their service got faster in a positive way. Their thai food on the way back was awesome, the portion got somehow in general smaller than few years ago. Unfortunately, their ground check-in service at Zurich airport was fast but somehow provided by a cold swiss lady without any charm unlike usual Thai airways service. "

What I experience let me think that Thai is on an upward slope. First, the plane didn't dock at the terminal-finger and 250+ passengers had to get down stairs, take a bus, get up again to get to the airport. I didn't mind, but seeing the fathers carrying the strollers and the mothers carrying the crying kids, and seeing the people having problems taking stairs, I thought it would have been easier to relocate the plane instead of relocate 250+ passengers. Once on board, apparently, things got delayed and the flight crew was pushing people to move quickly instead of helping passengers. The food was ok, not special, but they totally skewed up the vegetarian options. My seat was broken and extremely uncomfortable. And in order to get some water during the 9 hours daytime flight, I had to get to the galley. All in all my impression was, that this airline does not deserve the high rankings."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Bengaluru to Bangkok,November 2017,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,2.0,1,no,3," I have been flying Thai Airways for the past 20+ years and I have noticed quite a deterioration in quality and service levels especially to Asian and India routes. Ticket prices have increased markedly over the years and possibly now much higher than other carriers on the same routes. A Bengaluru to Bangkok return in business class is about THB40,000 (US$ 1250) which is exorbitant for a 3.5 hour flight. For this price, there is no Jetbridge services and passengers need to walk down stairs and bundle into a crowded bus that takes a very long time to reach the arrivals gate. The aircraft put into service is a bit old and worn. My main grouse is the price. I checked out a BKK-HKG flight recently and price on TG was about THB12500 while Cathay was THB8,000. What a difference!"
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-400,Business,Business Class,Munich to Osaka via Bangkok,November 2017,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1," Munich to Osaka via Bangkok. Avoid B747 Business Class where ever you can! First: it is a mystery to me how you can waste such a lot of space for such an uncomfortable seat. It is not angled lie flat or even flat at all. I wouldn’t care about an angle, but these seats are too short (I'm 1,86m) and have several angles, so at maximum you can lay back somehow, and the footrest isn’t stable, so whenever you move (even in turbulence) it will sort of “swing”. Secondly: service shows much effort but little result. For instance: There are attendants all over the cabin, but if you need any kind of refill (wine, coffee, water) you have to go to the galley and ask for it. Thirdly: the Lounge at BKK: completely overcrowded, had to wait for an hour to take a shower (which was a mould lover’s paradise), and don’t even think of the famous spa, if your transit time is below 5hrs. In a nutshell: outdated product, inefficient service, poor lounges, not worth the money. On their 747s I would not even call it a Business Class. A good premium eco will be a much better product and deal."
✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Sydney via Bangkok,November 2017,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,2,no,2,"  My wife and I decided to fly Thai Airways as we had flown with them a number of years before and had a good experience. On this occasion there were a few issues. The first leg from London Heathrow to Bangkok was excellent, flew an A380, great flight. The second leg from Bangkok to Sydney was on a clapped out 747, the flight itself was mediocre but the service was very poor. The major problem was on the last leg from Bangkok to London Heathrow, we were supposed to fly an A380 but apparently the plane was ""broken"", however, it seems the plane had been unavailable for at least 7-10 days prior without a replacement A380 being found. After a delayed take-off, which again appears to have been the case for more than a week, we shuddered home on a 777, must be the noisiest plane I have flown on in 40 years. I booked a long-haul flight on an A380 as I am very tall and the leg-room is usually good and the comfort is usually excellent. Not so the 777, my knees were in constant contact with the chair in front for a 12 hour flight. If I book an A380, I expect to fly one just like if I book a Mercedes I don't expect a Ford! No more Thai Airways for me."
✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Bangkok,October 2017,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,3,no,2,"  Singapore to Bangkok, it is more the normal than the exception that you are forced to take an airport bus from the plane to the terminal. Bangkok airport being Thai Airways home base you should expect that you would get premium service but not with Thai airways. You may be packed in an old bus like cattle. There is no customer service. Not worthy of Star alliance. as this is a low cost quality."

I was really excited as I had never flow Thai Airways business before. A 10 minute delay which was due to late arrival of aircraft can be ignored. However, overall not up to expectations for a business class flight . Attendants service was superb and serving of food and drinks was top notch. Being vegetarian had pre-ordered the Asian vegetarian meal. Food was about average. I am somewhat disappointed that even though non-vegetarians get a full 3 course meal comprising of salad/starters, mains, dessert and cheese tray why are vegetarians served a single tray of food. I am sure airlines have enough food experts to devise a lavish vegetarian meal for its business customers. Seats  very bad on 777-200 with little to no lumbar support and limited recline."
✅ Verified Review ,A380-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to London,December 2016,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,4,yes,10," I went back to visit my family in Thailand and got a one way ticket back to London with Thai Airways. I have been warned by many Thai friends that I would not receive a good service on this airline plus Thai Airways is always the most expensive. I decided to book because I wanted to experience 'the service' and I have hadn't flew with them for long time (my last flight with Thai Airways was in 2007, I was a little kid could not remember anything). I got a one way ticket for 25250 THB about = 580 GBP for one way. On the day I flew, I was almost the last one entering the airplane since I was enjoying my shopping time at BKK duty free but the air crew still welcomed me with a smiley face. Since I was one of the last onboard, I did not have space in over head cabin to put my carry on bags. The purser assisted very nicely. He took my bag to put in somewhere in the back and told me that he will take it back to me once the plane departed. He took another one to his room and suggested I do not put valuable items in either bag until I get it back. After the first meal (I did not eat much because I was not hungry, it was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning in Thailand). I was asleep for long time and once I got up another staff member asked if I was hungry or want anything else like a sandwich or something. It was totally different to what I have heard from other people so I did not expect this much better service to happen to me. The seat was new and comfortable. Once we arrived all the crew were sending passengers out of the plane with Thai style greetings. I don't know how can they do that after a 12-hour flight, really impressed."

Friendly staff, but they do not let you mix Thai and European meals. They refuse to serve you a European starter and a Thai main course. Totally stupid. Then i ordered the salmon with beurre blanc sauce, but here was no sauce; after I asked them i was replied that they forgot it. I ordered a white wine listed on the menu, but there was no white wine, the flight attendant replied that the catering also forgot it. My friend asked for another wine, same reply, When you consider that Thai is the most expensive airline from Paris, you expect more than that. One more round trip to use my miles and I will be done with this airline."

Used Fly Emirates Airline and our preferred Singapore Airlines. We always read reviews regarding airlines mainly about on-board service and leg room as my husband is quite tall 6’6”. We’ve chosen Thai Air this time despite mixed reviews regarding leg room. I can truly and honestly say what a pleasant surprise. Our flihgt from London do Bangkok was full. My husband chose the seat by the window. When we got seated he said straight away it is going to be fine, not to worry. What a relief. We both had enough leg room as well as seats were wide enough and very comfortable. On board service as well as food and drinks were brilliant. We’ve had a very comfortable journey and even more comfortable on the way back from Bangkok to London as there was an empty seat next to us. Even though me and my husband we stayed in our seats for the whole journey. Friendly and nice flight attendants, nothing was never a problem. Thank you very much for making our trip very comfortable and enjoyable."
✅ Verified Review ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Shanghai,October 2017,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,4,yes,8,"  Bangkok-Shanghai return. Boarding in Bangkok started very close to the scheduled departure time by which time the gate was crowded with passengers forming queues voluntarily. When boarding finally commenced, passengers were boarded according to classes and row numbers. The gate agents had the boarding process fully under control which was brisk and orderly. An earlier start to the boarding process will be more comfortable for passengers who just want to get settled in rather than stand around at the gate area. Cabin crew was on hand to welcome passengers on board and were present throughout the cabins during boarding. The cabin was clean and bright. It was nice having seats of 2 to 3 different colours randomly scattered throughout the economy cabin making it vibrant. The cabin crew first came round with a packet of snacks followed by a drinks service and then a meal service. 2 options are available for the main meal. I opted for the curry snapper which was good. At the end of the meal service, Chinese tea and green tea were served together with tea/coffee. It is always a treat to fly with THAI as it has consistently provided excellent F&B and a delightfully warm inflight service."

The cabin staff were excellent. They moved us to another noisy place and, the entertainment system didn't work. 9 hour overnight flight can't sleep, can't watch a movie. Return flight was supposed to be Yangon - Bangkok - Brisbane, but weather turned bad in Myanmar, all hot air balloon flights cancelled,  so we decided to go to Thailand. We did this with Bangkok Airways who were easy to deal with and terrific. However, to cancel the Thai Airways leg from Yangon to Bangkok would cost us a AUD300 each. That is a total rip off.

Later on, from BKK we flew on a B777-300 with also the new 1x2x1 flat bed, a full flight, but service did not suffer. It was still the same good service with a very good selection of 4 main courses (available for longer route) for dinner, plus desserts etc. Crew are present throughout the night flight with drinks and snacks etc. Managed a few hours of sleep and woke up to a delicious breakfast. Arrived on time and overall, very satisfied with my choice. Definitely value for money there."

Flying on the A350 was a great experience: Cabin extremely quiet, comfortable seats and very large IFE seatback screens. Excellent range of latest release movies and tv shows. Reclining the seat causes the seat to slide forward, which slightly reduces legroom. Personally I like this, as it means reclining doesn't trouble the person behind. Meals were ok, though not wonderful. The child meal we booked for our daughter (for both sectors) was delivered on the MXP-BKK sector but wasn't loaded on the BKK-MEL sector. Cabin crew on the A350 or at least the one crew member looking after our seat (33A-C) didn't smile once in the 10+ hours on board. She was quite abrupt at times during meal service, which is disappointing and very uncharacteristic for Thai crew. The crew on the second sector were much nicer. Friendly and professional at all times. TG 461 BKK-MEL was a 777. Noisier than the A350 with smaller IFE screens which had much less clarity. The 777 seats are comfortable, though the legroom wasn't as good as the A350. Again, the food was ok though not as good as Thai flights a couple of years ago. Overall a reasonable experience with both flights on-time."

Warm enduring service is what I really enjoyed on Thai. The cabin crew in business class are excellent and have tremendous experience; even offering light meal or drink options if you are not hungry! I love that Thai serves iced tea - they have a great sour iced tea as well. While the food was not anything to write home about, the service is from the heart. I was surprised they did not have chocolate on board. The hard product differed on each aircraft with the uncomfortable recliner seats on the Delhi-Bangkok-Delhi sector and a much better 1-2-1 lie-flat seat (still tight) on the Beijing sector. IFE was absent on the Delhi-Bangkok leg and there was a limited selection on other routes flown. Seats seemed worn out and tired. The loos were clean and fragrant with L'occitane amenities. Amenity kits were given out on all flights; again different ones on both sectors. Ground service is near absent - priority bags came last and as a business class passenger there are no priority benefits. Would recommend, although the Bangkok airport is a near nightmare during early morning transits due to insane line-ups, even if you are in J class!"

I booked this ticket specially to get a ride on the new A350 on my way to Bangkok. The flight was smooth and really quiet. The crew members are polite and very efficient, served a hot wrap, a bottle of water and coffee in such a short flight. Only issue is that the flight was delayed for about 40 minutes and no explanation was given. Also when flying domestic on this wide body jets expect remote parking and being bused to the terminal which in my case today added another 20 minutes to the delay. Despite the delay the rest was really good."

Instead the AB350 we had an old Boeing 747 from Bangkok to Auckland, and luckily I got a seat in the First compartment, their seat and especially flat bed were much better then the new seat on the A350. The big difference to carriers from the Middle East is the staff: one feels like home in Thailand, with very friendly and efficient staff with a Thai smile. In transit in Bangkok Airport I took a free massage (neck and shoulders for 30 minutes) which is free for business travellers at the Thai Spa, and was a very good refreshing experience."

I choose Thai food from Milan to Bangkok and Western food from Bangkok to Auckland, which was a mistake: I recommend to choose Thai food out of Bangkok and western food out of non Asia destinations. The Italian food served looked better then the Thai food out of Milan. The A350 is the latest aircraft of Thai and amazingly the seats on the newest aircraft of Thai are less comfortable then on the old B777; especially the flat bed on the A350 is less comfortable, has less space (length!) then ones on the B777. Everything on the A350 (including washrooms) looked smaller than the B777."

Thai Airways left my luggage on the way to my destination. They said it would be on the next flight. After persistent emails the only places I could get responses out of were the Bali airport luggage department and their twitter account. Both of which consistently knew nothing and send me away to contact other departments and email addresses. 6 days later they found a bag that matches mine. Upon confirmation it was clear the bag never left England. As I was no longer in Bali I requested the bag to not leave the country and be sent to a home address as sending it to Bali would cause it to be further lost. The next day I get an email saying ""good news"" we're sending it to Bali right now. To which I got a boat back and two hour drive, plus a hotel to get to the airport to find they decided to put it on the next one. Eventually I got the bag 16 hrs before my flight back to the UK. The whole thing cost me a fortune and I was one of several people this happened to on the flight. Further to this the flight was pretty poor with meal choices that ran out. "

I have flown on Thai Airways before, and was very happy, but there seems to have been a change in the quality of the overall service. On the flight to Bangkok, dinner was served, cold! Drinks were hard to come by. The seat was uncomfortable and there was a serious lack of leg room. The bottom of the magazine holder was damaged and the magazines kept sliding through. The tray table arm was damaged and the table listed to the left, with anything placed on the tray and table wanting to slide off. Then on the flight from Bangkok to Dubai, the tray table arm was also damaged and listed to the left, so drinks wanted to slide off. The magazine holder was damaged and magazines slid out.

Very efficient check in at all cities I flew with them. The priority customs and immigration process you get at Suvarnabhumi Bangkok Int'l in business class is a blessing. The business class cabin was spotless and in good condition. The cabin staff were as attentive as usual. The only complaint I would have is the state of the business lounge at Suvarnabhumi Airport. The lounge really is in need of an upgrade. For example, Thai Airways solution to a wall with water damage and wall paper peeling off was to place pot plants in front of the problem. A very Thai solution but doesn't really fix the issue. I must also admit that my last two occasions I have used this lounge the food has been surprisingly good. I have not always been able to say that."

Thai use wide bodies (a few different ones A350, 777, A330) a few times a day on their domestic BKK to Chiang Mai route which is about an hour long. Downside is you are bused to international side of airport and then walk up a stairway to the jetty vs relocating the airplane to the domestic side, stairs are little challenging if old. I opt for these vs narrow body ThaiSmile or other airlines as there is generally a lot of priority to ensure they are on-time within a small buffer zone of 20 minutes. Seats are good, 9 across in 777 versus the spacing saving in most carriers is evident. Service is rushed given the time, but coffee and small chicken snack. IFE was old but reasonable. Cabin crew are rapid paced which is fantastic, I'd love to see if they have same energy on international legs. I think the 9 across dated cabin would be much better internationally than 10 across, I'd sacrifice the extra 2"" IFE screen for the extra 1"" seat width. Minus a point for no beer available. Overall a great flight."

Seat was extremely comfortable and wide as TG still maintains 9-abreast seating on the 777. IFE screen a little subpar of other carriers such as Cathay Pacific as it wasn't responsive and often times would lag. Crew worked hard to provide snacks and several round of drinks during the 45-minutes flight. The snack was a Carbonara wrap with several choices of juice and mineral water to accompany. The wrap itself was delightful and appropriate of a size for the duration and timing of the flight. Arrived Chiang Mai on time and bags came out within 20 minutes of disembarking. Overall, a huge improvement from a couple of years earlier and wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again."

For being a short haul flight, Thai Airways has a great service. When most other airlines do not even provide drinks on short flights of about 1 hour, Thai offers colds drinks and a hot snack even in Economy class. Flight attendants are pleasant and courteous and the IFE on their Boeing 777 is great, although you have to bring along your own headphones as it is a domestic flight.

That is even when you are flying in / out of its home airport. For my flight from Hong Kong to Bangkok there were multiple gates a free but still Thai passengers have to take a bus. You should then think if you are in business class you would be in a business class bus. No - the sign on the bus says so, but the bus does not leave until completely packed. One word - cost savings over passenger comfort. If you make the effort to ask the Thai call center you will get a list of excuses from it is the control tower to the weather. No - it is Thai that deliberately decide to save cost and neglect their passengers. When my miles are used you have lost a long time customer for good."

Thai used to have fantastic leg room in economy, but now it's down to 32"" or 31"" seat pitch, OK but not really comfortable for someone 194cm tall, as I am. The Boeing 777-200 on the first leg was old but OK, the front economy cabin on the A380 on the second leg was curtained off from the rest of the aircraft and was a very quiet and comfortable area - not surprising given that this area is used by some airlines for first class. Food and service on both flights were very good (given that it's Y class after all) and the baggage allowance generous (40kg for me as a silver status Royal Orchid Program flyer). However, being offered almost identical two breakfasts on the same day (one on the inbound aircraft and one on the outbound aircraft five hours later) wasn't a great experience - at least I had a choice of main dish so could vary it slightly. The international transfer arrangements in BKK are a disgrace - the airport is really letting the airline down. I arrived in BKK on TG 462 at 6am and departed TG672 at 8.25am. I joined the transfer queue at around 6.20am and only got through security at around 7.25. A lot of the time was spent held back at a gate where desperate pax with tight connections were coming forward and begging to be allowed through but told by unsympathetic officials to go back into the queue. I had sufficient time to make my onward flight but the whole process was stressful and I think that BKK airport's bureaucratic incompetence really undermines a lot of the good work done by TG staff on long haul flights. For the most part, though, Thai provides a good experience in long haul economy."

Flying experience was exceptional. The first flight from Hong Kong to Bangkok was delayed for one hour due to the thunderstorm in Hong Kong. This shrunk my transfer time by one hour. However, ground staff at Bangkok airport friendly helped us and the connection was finally smooth. From Hong Kong to Bangkok I flewed on an old B747 but entertainment system was updated. Cabin crew was enthusiastic and hot towel was provided when boarding. From Bangkok to London I flewed on A380. Although legroom was tighter than that on B747, it provides more seat recline and I found it comfortable as well as a 190cm. Food was among the best, especially compared with airlines in China. Each meal consisted of hot food, dessert and salad. Freshly baked croissant was provided at breakfast. I will definitely fly with Thai again."

First long haul flight in a very long time on an Thai A380. Royal Silk Class is a 1-2-1 configuration, and I had a B seat (window side, but slightly separated from the wall). Comfortable seat, two window-side storage bins, plenty of space between the seat and the window to put your shoes and other stuff. What I like of the A380 seat is that you can slide the tray with your full dinner on it and easily move out of your seat. I am used to high quality service and excellent food in Royal Silk, but this time the service highly exceeded any previous experience. Excellent flight overall. If I only had any - very minor - complaints it would be that, after 5 years in service, the monitors seem to have a lower resolution than more modern aircraft (or probably it's only my impression, as my inbound flight was on a super modern A350 where the monitor quality was impeccable), also, the restrooms, even in Royal Silk, feel quite small comparing to Thai's A350 or B747. Also about the restrooms, I was happy to find that the moisture lotion has gone back to the excellent Bulgari Eau Parfumée au Thé (Blanc now, it used to be Vert a few years ago), after switching to Era's Cloud Nine for a while. The only pity is that the lady in front of me stole the whole bottle after less than 15 minutes into the flight. Despite these little details, a great flight experience! One final note: check-in, as always at CDG, was a nightmare. But it wouldn't be fair to give a bad evaluation to Thai's ground staff for that, as it was handled by CDG's staff. Even at embarkment, the lines handled by Thai's staff proceeded very swiftly, while my line (handled by CDG staff) was incredibly slow."

We booked Frankfurt to Bangkok then on to Phuket and Krabi. I briefly want to describe how different services with one airline can be. FRA-BKK was the afternoon flight TG921 with the B777-300ER. Unfortunatlely we had the entertainment box beneath our seats which made the space additional tight. The entertainment system was a bit difficult to understand and it took a while to find German translated movies. The service was not as expected. This was very average only. Additional our row was served a german traditional meal (thick noodles, red cabbage and goulash). No alternate was ordered. It felt like there were 3 german meals left and need to be distributed asap. This wasn’t satisfying. Drinks were served before and while lunch. Once again just before landing in Bangkok. In the meantime drinks were available in the Galley. Once we decided to push the “crew button” for service. However no one appeared at all. However even if the services was not as expected the flight was safe and on time."

Unfortunately, the seat that I had reserved was changed without my knowledge resulting in my travelling partner and I having to request the check-in staff to look for seats to seat us near each other. Fortunately, there were available seats. The same thing happened on our return flight where our pre-reserved seats were changed without prior notice. This time there were no seats available for us to be seated near each other. The cabin crew were friendly, approachable and seem happy to help. Shortly after departure, a drink service with a small packet of snacks were given, followed by the meals service. Just before the meal service ends, the cabin crew came round with another round of drinks service. The catering was good and the portion generous."

Boarding was very quick and efficient and we were soon sitting on our seats that we had reserved online in advance. The aircraft was pretty worn, IFE screen was tiny and the resolution reminded me of flights I took between shortly after personal screens were introduced. At least the content was on demand. The seat was rather comfortable and every passenger got a blanket and a pillow. However, the seat felt narrow and it was not possible for me to find a comfortable sleeping position without constantly touching some buttons of the IFE remote, which had the result, that the screen was constantly switched on again. The crew was disappointing, they were not able to live up to the reputation Thai has. Although they were very efficient and service oriented, I almost felt as if they were yelling at me. The cover of my armrest was loose and fell off. When I told the FA, she put it back and said "" It's okay?"". Needless to say it fell off again shorty after. Food was OK, but not exceptional. "

Cabin crew were very polite and with a lovely Thai Smile as you would get anywhere in Thailand. The seat was like an exit seat and had plenty of leg room which was great and even managed to charge my phone on board. The B777 was nice inside and looks like it has had an upgrade to add plug sockets to charge devices which is great. Through out the flight the cabin crew were pleasant and always happy to help. 2 meals were served on board which were nice and appealing. On landing. Exiting the plane was smooth and no issues and was given a Thai farewell. The return journey back to Heathrow from BKK. Checking in at BKK was easy as always and no problems and check in staff were helpful. Same plane back but had a last row seat in the middle which was ok but legroom was adequate but at times felt a bit uncomfortable. This was not at issue with the seat i took more that i am a big guy. Cabin crew were equally as good on board through out the return flight and food was equally the same on both trips. Would I use Thai Airways again. Yes.  Nice seats, able to charge a phone on board. Pleasant crew on board. In flight entertainment was good. Good nice meals on board. Also 30kg luggage allowance against BA or EVA 23 KG allowance which is far better."

✅ Verified Review ,A330,Family Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Phuket,June 2017,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,1,no,2, Thai Airways puts family with children as last priority. I was flying Bangkok to Phuket with my two kids and had a stroller with me. As with all airlines I was asked to leave the stroller at the entrance of the cabin which I did. But what came after was a disaster. Thai Airways made all the families with children wait for their strollers till the last luggage came of the baggage reclaim. So it's really no point flying business class as we still had to wait till the last luggage as with other families whom had to wait for their strollers.

When I arrived at the airport I saw a very long queue (more than 100 people) and it was for my flight check in. At first I was shocked but the registration process was efficient so it took about 40 minutes. We took off without delay and it was a smooth flight. The plane was very old but everything was clean. The service was responsive and attentive as always. Food (including alcohol) was above average. But it was expected. It's not a low cost airline and the minimum regular fare is more than 250 usd for this about 3 hours flight. So I put it 8 from 10 (minus 1 for an old plane and minus 1 for price/quality.

We were unable to order a special meal online prior to check in which was disappointing and especially as my partner requires a Muslim / Halal Meal. No menus were distributed and cabin staff were unsure whether the meals contained pork and had to make enquiries. For outgoing and return night flights no socks, slippers, tooth brush / paste or ear plugs given in economy class. Thai Airways seem to be cutting costs on this route at the expense of passenger comfort and yet the flights are usually more expensive than other airlines due to being non stop flights. The meals could be described as average at best. Food and beverage on other airlines I have used are superior to Thai. I am old enough to remember the days when Thai Airways issued all ladies with a complementary Orchid on arrival. We raised all the above points with the senior cabin crew who were sympathetic and suggested writing to the airline, hence this review. Not keen to fly this sector again with Thai Airways in the near future."

It has come to my concern that Thai has had serious delays at HKG recently on their service to BKK. Crew was mostly unhelpful and quite rude and robotic in their attitude when asked for an immigration card. The only reason to keep me flying with Thai is their newly introduced service to Tehran via Bangkok and also their top-notch gastronomic experience which was on par with my past experience flying on their Economy and Business Class.

Their IFE, which has ample content, continued to play even after landing, which were all smooth. The only thing TG doesn't seem to have are new aircraft. The planes I took were well-maintained and spotless but at a time when other players boast of equipment barely two years old, you feel like being in a well-maintained and immaculately presented 2001 Toyota Altis with TG while your neighbor pulls up in a 2017 Honda Civic."

Entertainment system didn't work on a 9 hr flight, instead of moving us to other seats, the Purser tries to reset, it took nearly two hours for him to fiddle with to no avail, still he doesn't want to move us to other seats, while other passengers are already taking other empty seats prior to taking off. At the end he gave up and suggested to us to move to another two separate seats, why do we need to accept mediocre service? So we refused his offer, he could have done more at the beginning when we told them that he should move us in the first place. Surely they can make a note online or check in that these seats so and so have issues, so passengers don't have to sit on those seats. It wasn't a full flight too. The Purser tries to appease us by offering a bottle of perfume, which I refused, as we only want a working entertainment system that works. While I was sleeping he gave my wife two Business Class amenities - we do not want TG amenities in lieu of non-working entertainment system. Cabin crew are mostly good, I find some are very slow to response. On a good note, the meals are excellent for economy class."

Meal was a choice of chicken curry or fish. I had the chicken curry and it was delicious with rice and crunchy beans. My partner had the fish and he said it was delicious. Soft drinks wine and spirits were offered with the meal service. The wine was ok after one glass decided to stay with ginger ale. Service was professional and smiles all round. Throughout the flight they offered water and juice, later in the flight they offered mango ice blocks, yummy. Toilets were kept clean and fresh, they are good sized toilet on this aircraft 787.

Don't understand why the soup is served at the same time. By the time you have eaten it the rest of the food on the tray is lukewarm. Full flat seats which were comfortable but tight. Crew disappeared after the meal service to appear again 2 hours before landing. The return flight had a technical problem and we were advised around 1 pm by email that our departure at 0015 had been rescheduled for 0715 and that we should contact the customer service for further info. After holding the telephone line for 10 mins we finally got through. I explained that we had to get home today and not tomorrow and. the agent then put me on hold for another 10 mins only to then explain that there were no business class seats available on european bound flights that evening but we could go economy. He couldn't advise how and if I would get the difference for the airfare reimbursed. I refused to do this and he answered ""then we would just have to wait."" No offer of accommodation etc. We gave up frustrated and went to the airport in hope of further help. Strangely enough at the airport they were able to put us on the next flight to Frankfurt with an onward connection to London. This was an A380 and we were upstairs. The aircraft is really quiet. However, do not take the seats in front of the toilets in this cabin. The constant flushing of the toilets resulted in getting no sleep. Otherwise a normal flight nothing special. Would I fly them again? Probably not."

I started pressing buttons on the control, then she appeared and practically snatched it out of my hand and said something like ""don't touch takes 10 minutes"". So I waited and waited and waited. In the end I gave up and decided to try to sleep. I put the blanket over my head and relaxed. Within 10 minutes she was tapping at me saying ""try now try now"". It didn't work. She asked if I wanted to move seats I said yes. So finally sitting with a working screen. Then when the meals came around I was given a vegetarian meal. I tried to tell them I didn't order it but they said ""just wait"" I felt like a child in school being chastised! Same hostess who was supposedly fixing my screen came to me and asked what the problem was. I said I didn't order this may I have a normal meal. She then went on to to say why are you in this seat its not yours. I said you told me to sit here because my screen wasn't working. "

Due to the number of passengers between Phuket and Bangkok jumbo jets are used on the route and the company proposes an IFE for the short 1H flight. However, you can feel that Thai is facing tough times as the choice of food and drinks has been drastically cut. The only drink offered is water or juice, which puts Thai below European carriers (except BA) for short hauls. Overall a cheap flight, with a nice IFE but below standards food and drinks."

The A330 on route from Krabi to Bangkok seemed to be a very old and outdated model. Shows major signs of wear and tear. Special meal was not catered and the onboard staff were absolutely careless. On the night flight (BKK to FRA) no decaffeinated coffee was available in the upper economy class galley. It caused major confusion amongst the onboard staff to make decaffeinated coffee readily available. Even a main purser was unable to straighten out this problem. Highly disappointing and undignified and unworthy of a four star airline. Luggage arrived in Frankfurt with major damage.

I had stayed In the Singapore Airlines Heathrow lounge until final boarding was called and the gate was across from the lift exit. The person controlling passenger entry to the upper or lower deck entry looked at me and said 'economy?' I said 'first'. I was directed to the right hand aisle and after sorting myself out was offered a drink. Then a person introduced herself as a flight manager and said to ask her about anything. Flight took ages from gate to take off as Heathrow was full. Seat is wide and comfortable but I could always see middle seat passenger whilst seat was in sitting position. Had more Champagne after takeoff with a funny bit of chicken first, followed by a Thai northern sausage, which was hot, but I did not like the cooked egg dish or nuts. The caviar is now served in a controlled portion screw top bottle with plated garnitures and vodka has to be requested. I chose a Thai selection for main course which was extensive. Duck in red curry was not very succulent as I don't think that reheating duck can turn out very well, unless as Confit. Dried shrimp was fiercely hot. Long cooked soft pork was soft. I did not need anything else but the cheese looked nothing special. Red wine was an improvement on anything offered in Thai that I have ever had. Sleeping was not so good. Seat length and width are good. But the seat is hard and segmented, the seat cover and blanket are of poor quality and they could purchase United Polaris pillows rather than the uncomfortable two currently on offer. I was in 1K and the lighting from the front staircase was intrusive. By the way, the bar area at the front of the plane is disused, apart from providing somewhere to sit whilst your bed is being made up. Overall not really worth paying for over Business class product."

Me and my luggage was checked in all the way to Auckland. However, I had to pick up my boarding pass for KUL - Auckland stretch in Bangkok airport. At Bangkok airport I was advised by Thai Airways representative that they need to verify my visa. On my remark that it was verified in KUL airport already, I was advised that their internal system isn't working and they cannot check. I was told to wait. After waiting for 1 hour, I came to the counter, and asked what is going on. A Thai airways representative said he sent Telex to New Zealand immigration, and there's no reply from them. So he cannot put me on the flight unless he gets response from them. He said my visa isn't real and there is something wrong with my passport, that's why there's no feedback. I told him to call the immigration. He said they cannot do overseas calls. Eventually, I called Auckland airport and asked to put me through to immigration. I talked to the immigration officer, who confirmed that it's not the right thing that Thai Airways is doing. He talked to the representative then, and gave me the direct number of the immigration office that deals with the airline inquiries. I called that number, and while talking to the immigration officer the Thai Airways staff gave me the pushed the boarding pass. My first and last flight with Thai Airways."

Did not intend to fly with Thai Airways from Bangkok to London originally but due to a technical problem with my flight from Chiang Mai to Bangkok, we were delayed over 5 hours and I missed my original flight with Etihad. Thai Airways handled the delay very well providing us with snacks, water and blankets during our wait in Chiang Mai for a replacement aircraft. Upon arrival in Bangkok at 4am staff were already waiting for passengers with missed connections as we got off the plane. Went to the sign with my original flight on him and staff told me and other passengers that we would be taken to a hotel and flown to London on the afternoon Thai Airways flight. After a quick sleep at the hotel, we arrived back at the airport with transport provided by the airline. Check in took a while due to staff having to rebook us onto the afternoon flight but we were eventually checked in and were on our way. The flight to London was very good, seats on the Boeing 777-300ER comfortable, decent legroom. Staff were cheerful and friendly. Very surprise to get a sandwich service before landing on top of the two meal services. Drinks always being bought down the aisle by the crew. IFE could've been better but the selection was just enough. Overall, good experience with Thai Airways despite the ordeal with the delay. Will fly with them again."

The seat reservation procedure at Thai Airways is not understood, and no staff is aware or able to explain it. Before our flight from Bangkok to Frankfurt at 23:40, we checked in in Phuket at 15:30 and asked for an exit row seat or another seat by the window. It was not possible because of reasons we were not told, we were asked to check once again in Bangkok upon arrival. We did it which was still 5 hours before boarding, so not even check in counter for the flight was open, but we were told flight was full and no reservation can be done. We were asked to talk to flight manager who was supposed to be there 2 hours before boarding but ended up in last 15 minutes. All in all, despite being at airport several hours before, we could not get an exit row which should be based on certain physical restrictions. So somehow Thai Airways reserves these seats to people without seeing them! Anyway, we started our trip with this frustration. Then wrote an email to Thai airways about it but received no feedback. I will try to avoid Thai Airways for future trips to Asia. They lost a frequent flying customer."

When I eventually reached the check-in desk, I asked for my bags to be checked through to the onward destination, told this was not possible as it was not with the same airline. News to me as I have done this numerous times, if airlines are codeshare or in the same alliance etc. Check in staff are not interested in giving customer service so why airlines use this facility is beyond me. Boarding chaotic, no sign, no announcement just a woman shouting who could board over a full A380 flight, resulted in every-one boarding at the same time as passengers were asking each other what was happening. Aircraft was the high standard of the A380 – good leg room, touch screen, OK recline with good menu and quality of good. Staff had an appalling attitude, they did not hide the fact that they would rather be doing other things than providing customer service on this flight

I haven't used Thai for about 4 years due to their aircraft choices and pricing. However being a return trip to Sydney from Thailand in Holiday season choices were limited. My original booking was in economy although most times I use business (Christmas holiday pricing again) but I intended to try for a paid standby upgrade at the airport for this return flight, which I was offered. To my surprise Thai Airways have now increased the upgrade cost by around 30 - 35% and is now very poor value and not recommended for anyone that may be considering it. The aircraft was an elderly 747-400 which was showing it's age. The business class seats (upstairs) were angled lie flat, very worn with faded upholstery. These are the same business seats Thai have used for close on 15 years and are way past their use by date. Considering they are flying Boeing 787's to Brisbane and the new A350 to Melbourne I cannot see why we still have this worn out 747 on Thai's most important Australian market, Sydney. The food service has improved slightly from what I can remember with the food now plated by the flight attendants before serving however they still insist on a totally French wine list where most other airlines offer some Australian or NZ wines on the route. The inflight entertainment is pretty poor with limited choices compared to competitor airlines. The screen size and clarity is also poor due to the age of the system. I will continue to avoid Thai on this route as much as possible as their business class fares are some of the most expensive on the route yet they offer what is, by far, the worst product against their competitors (both direct flights and ones with acceptable transit stopovers)."

But no one in BKK airport anticipated this by booking the hotel for the passengers. When we arrived at BKK airport, the customer service said they had not booked the hotel room and airport hotel was fully booked. We were asked to wait at the counter for almost 3 hours while the staff disappeared (helping another passenger with the visa). It is midnight and everybody was very tired, but who cares.

Thai Airways offered much better service compared to my previous journey. The counter was big enough to take all of the passengers swiftly. However, the problem occurred after half of the check-in counter closed, in order to take Uni Air passengers. Large group of travellers were forced to go around and line up again. It was not understandable how they had 3 special checkin counters where few people used (Crew only, Internet checkin, and Business class/SA Gold card holders), and had 2 common economy class checkin counters where everybody used. After the bad start at check-in, we had to run in order to make it to the gate, as Incheon was crowded at that time. Onboard, the cabin looked very clean and new. The seat width felt little bit small for me with heavy lady seating alongside me, but seat pitch was acceptable; it felt same with other airlines in my seat. I moved my seat for the second leg of the flight, as there was an empty seat. I moved to a window side seat, and the seat width felt very nice to me. However,  there is a metal box under the seat in front of you, which restricted me to stretch out both legs (which was possible in some degrees in my previous seat).  Cabin staff service, I couldn't find flaw in their service. They were willing to help, and cared about passenger safety. They were there to help passengers to put up their carry on items to overhead bins, which must have been hard for them, as the flight was almost full. I am impressed with cabin crew service. In this flight, I never knew that I could stuff in 2 meals in such short time period (6:30 hours?). Their food quantity was just right, and food quality was nice. However, in both of my flight, as a passenger seating in front side cabin, I was forced to choose the meal that I did not want. Once, when I asked cabin crew if they have another meal that I could eat, they brought me business-class food for me, which was obviously very pleasing, and nice of them.  I would love to give TG 5 star rating on food, but I can't, as some meal options was unavailable. IFE was quite nice; it takes a little bit of time to get used to, but once you get used to it, it will work dandily. I really liked how they had traveling information about big cities such as Bangkok, Seoul, Tokyo, and more. But their variety of Music/Movie/TV Shows could be improved in the future. Wi-Fi was available, but it was paid service. Overall, I recommend this airline because of it's amazing cabin crew, food service, and cleanliness of their aircraft."

I thank the ground staff in Chennai (MAA) for giving me priority baggage tag for my ""gold"" Star Alliance membership status. Well, but they weren't supposed to; Asiana Club gold is equivalent to Star Alliance silver status! Also, when they were asked to put our seat together, which they told us that it is possible to do so before, they did it for us; but there was an aisle separating both of us. Boeing 77-200 uses 3-3-3 layout, and their seat width was very nice, but seat pitch felt very cramped with an IFE box under one of my foot, making me fly the whole 3:30 hr flight with my right leg folded. Food was tasty though, and flight attendants weren't bad. They were smiling, and was willing to help, but the part where they just watched at the passengers getting up shortly after landing (When seatbelt sign was on) was pretty disappointing. A330-300 was better because I could actually go to sleep. After landing at HKG, we was asked to deplane and get on a another A330, and ground crew messed up again. One TG ground crew at the gate told us to go to certain gate. We found that there was no plane at all! We then asked another ground crew (Who was working for HKG airport this time,) She told me to walk about 6 minutes to get to our plane. We had to rush to catch up to our plane, and HKG ground staff was correct. A330 to HKG to ICN felt the same. In this flight, I tried using Wi-Fi, hoping for any free internet usage, but it was paid service. Personally, their IFE was terrible for me.  Despite the negatives, I saw lots of positives on this flight though. Cabin crews were very nice to me and my family, and were always there to help me. IFE's hardware of A333 was pretty impressive, or actually better than SQ's one, since TG's IFE offered touch screen!  Food was very nice; one of the most delicious plane food I've ever eaten.

But the lounge was disappointing, there was a small selection and the ambience was not really nice: dark and a bit dated. The boarding on to the plane was one of the best in my opinion. In the plane the seat offered enough legroom and as soon as I settled in to my seat the crew offered me champagne along with nuts and she also hang my jacket. There was a basic and functional amenity kit, together with a cozy blanket and pillow. After takeoff food was offered, but it was a bit disappointing. The crew forgot my wine for dinner and a coffee at breakfast, at breakfast they gave me the wrong option, don't know if they forgot or not, or they ran out of the other option.  After landing the deboarding was a bit of a mess, since all economy passengers ran in to Business. I would recommend to close the curtain while deboarding, so that this cannot happen. All in all it was enjoyable but I think Thai should fix this point to deliver even better."

All flights were on-time or nearly on-time and the cabin service on all sectors was of a high standard, but there is room for improvement in other areas. The cabin interiors seemed a little bit tired and worn out, especially on the 777, with the seat upholster being damaged and screens out of date and not working properly. I ordered a gluten-free (GF) meal but regretted the choice, as they seemed to have also removed almost everything else from the meal in the process, only giving me a bland piece of chicken with tasteless steamed vegetables. The normal meal looked much nicer and was incidentally GF anyway (rice and Thai curry). I cancelled the GF meal for the return journey and just substituted their bread with my own GF bread. It also seems a little strange and annoying that Thailand's flag carrier does not have adequate gate access at Bangkok airport, and so all of the flights involved bussing to and from the planes, which were parked very far away. Upon arrival in Melbourne I noticed that my bag had been opened and the zips broken. I lodged a complaint at the Melbourne luggage desk and after following it up just once, they ended up sending me a brand new suitcase in time for my return journey. I was quite satisfied with this response to my complaint. Even though I had a dis-functional screen on one sector, I was mostly satisfied with the entertainment overall system. The only other issue was the seat comfort. I really think this could be improved, as there was an entertainment system processing box under the seat of the 777 and the seats on the A330 felt like I was always sliding off them. Overall it was a decent product for the price, but they could especially improve on seat and cabin quality.

I had high expectations for Thai Airways in the Star Alliance group, but failed so miserably. On all four flights, the boarding time was not as printed on the boarding pass. All of them boarded at the departure time or later, and one flight was delayed because of technical reasons. I booked from Thai Airways website, and because the amount was over 10M rupiah, I had to come into the sales office in Jakarta to pay in person. Because my transit time was 18 hours, I received transport and accommodation in Bangkok, but even that I had to request and no details were given on the transportation procedures. At the Indra Regent hotel they didnt provide breakfast, despite Thai Airways saying that breakfast was on their account. When I asked Thai Airways to clarify this with the hotel, they said it's on the hotel. The entertainment system/screens were very old and dated, resolution wasn't good. The headphones jack didn't work on one side, and the magazine pocket wasn't fixed properly so the magazines kept on falling. After the meal service, picking up the trays took very long, and on one of the flights I had to call the attendants to pick mine up because they skipped me. Attendants weren't friendly. To have a blanket I needed to ask, not on every seat. Checking in at Dubai was the worst. Line was so long. Local staff had no customer service skills. I tried Thai Airways because of the price , but was not happy with the experience and probably won't recommend it to others. "

The aircraft is okay, no in flight entertainment offered. The boarding is terrible for all flight to and from Vietnam as you have to ride overcrowded bus to the field where the aircraft is waiting.

It is not nice if you have to carry small children. Inside the aircraft the service is good, food is okay, in the past it was much nicer but now they save the cost and reduce the quality of food.

The worst part, and something that always seems to happen on Thai flights that arrive late in the day - the plane was parked way out in the airfield, leaving passengers to climb down a set of stairs and take a very long bus ride to the terminal.  Our bags were then delayed meaning that I had to wait a whole hour after the flight had landed for our bags to arrive on the carousel. I asked the ground staff why, given that Thai is the national flag carrier, aircraft that arrive in the evening are not parked at the terminal, for the convenience of their customers. All I got in response was that this was their 'process'. Thai used to be a great airline. How far they have fallen astonishes me."

So on the flight back to Germany I chose the middle seat and there was no more of this problem. I was seated close to the front and chose my preferred meal but it was not available.

Boarding did not start until very close to the departure time but it was orderly. The crew welcomed the passengers on board,  offered a small pack of nuts once the seatbelt sign was off. The cabin crew change into their traditional Thai attire after take-off. The flight was probably around 60% full so there was ample space for passengers to spread out. I was initially seated in seat 62C which is the first row of 3 seaters behind 2 rows of 2 seaters so I had ample leg room ahead, As the row next to me was fully empty, I asked a cabin crew if I could move over and promptly did so when I received the go-ahead. 2 options were offered for meals and I picked the pork option. When compared with the catering coming out of Bangkok, the food from Bangkok does seems better.  In the flight out of Bangkok, two gentlemen seated near me (who seem to be first time flyers) did not realise that vegetarian options had to be pre-ordered and opted to go without food. The cabin crew then went out of his way to locate non-meat options for the 2 gentlemen. The seats are comfortable with a decent recline. There is a good selection of movies and TV shows to choose which, together with the food and friendly service, makes for a very comfortable flight."

First leg service was just excellent as on the way out from Europe aside from typical delays of coming into a congested airport like Bangkok. The Thai crew in stormy conditions managed to service everyone multiple times on a fully loaded flight, I was dreading the late night double leg flights home but my sensitive sleeping wife cat napped on the short leg and then due to a departing ahead of time settled down after a well served meal for the long haul home. She slept near 10 hours on what was bump free journey landing back ahead of time into Zaventem something never achieved with Brussels Airlines, United Airlines or British Airways night flights. This was my first Thai Airways experience but after flying with big American and European carriers this was something special with their 777-300ER out and back and with one leg of four flights on the one month old A350. It is clear this is an airline in transition with a new fleet coming in and our luck being we that we had all our flights on planes of just a couple of years old. I am now seriously tempted to fly Thai Airways to New Zealand on the next long haul as inflight entertainment and service was very good. This said three things Thai could simply fix to move in my book from Very Good to Excellent. Bringing a fully loaded 777 into a hard standing and using buses instead on to the terminal should not happen, we were lucky at end of rainy season but I dread to think what could have been if the tropical sky's had opened up. If you fly into Francophone countries you should have either copies of the film with French sound track or at least French subtitles, my Wife being French speaking Belgian was lucky to know English well. Your mild chicken is not mild, it was hotter than dishes served up in restaurants of the same this meal blew both us away and could not be consumed on one flight.

My main concern is the number of times I have to be bussed from the terminal to the aircraft and vice versa. For Thailand's flagship airline, this is a poor practice. Not withstanding the safety issues of passengers having to disembark via steps with luggage, it is a very cheap approach to what should be a much more pleasant experience. None of the crew or ground staff have a positive response to any questioning about this practice, but it certainly seems to tick off a lot of people, unfortunately not enough people complain about it and simply accept it."

The lounge prior to boarding in the A concourse was looking scuffed and it was crowded, food was not great but coffee and fruit were fine. Delays at the gate as well but so far was still in reasonable spirits. The A380 seats aren't the best but at east all offer aisle access. In the air the meals were reversed with breakfast first given the delay this was now a day flight instead of a night one. Crew were unresponsive and glum looking. Breakfast was very overcooked, had to ask for everything including missing cutlery. Two cracked and chipped glasses offered, one badly cracked showed lack of care and any inspection. They were genuinely apologetic when this was pointed out but this was a rare show of passenger focus. Did not see crew at all during the majority of the flight for any period of time between meals, water was replenished once. Dinner was not heated at all and asked for it to be reheated as it was inedible. No pre-dinner drinks, offered one drink with dinner, never saw any offer of any top ups in cabin to any other passengers. Not offered water with dinner. Drinks were replenished on request. In general I felt that you had to ask for everything, there was no anticipation of passenger need. We wanted the flight to be over as quickly as possible, an unusual response to business class. I wondered if the feeling of grief over the recent loss of their King may have had an impact. Would still recommend Thai and hope that our next flights are better with them."

This review is for one particular flight experience from Bangkok to Sydney on TG 475 business class. At the check in counter in Bangkok, I requested the staff not to provide a seat near the toilet. She told me my assigned seat (upper deck front seats) is not next to toilet. On boarding we found our seats to be next to toilet and had to endure passengers frequently visiting toilets and suffering bad smell wafting every time some one coming out of the toilet. Also we experienced a rude steward who was unprofessional with a number of passengers including us (like serving with a glum face and shoving foods etc. At least 6 passengers complained about his behaviour. We talked to a senior staff and the said steward offered apology. The food in the business class was unpalatable - I ordered a lasagne and it was totally uneatable. "

This B747 must be 30 years old. Outdated seats (no flat sleeping), not enough room for hand luggage in business class (they wanted me to bring my luggage downstairs to another seat and refused to put it into luggage space in upper deck). Food is at best average. Very limited selection and not high quality. Female staff are nice but males seem to be ex Thai military. No wonder these planes are half empty. Never again."

It is the first time I flew Thai Airways first class  long hauln. Due to aircraft type, I had to fly the evening flight, the only one fitted with first class. An overnight stay was necessary, but complimentary airport hotel stay was arranged. Service and food were lovely from HKG to BKK. Next day, I went to the first class lounge for a fabulous lunch, an hour free massage. I spent a few hours at the lounge before being escorted onboard. I was made very welcome. Gorgeous Rimova toiletry bag and nice pyjama provided. The spacious seat provides good privacy and a huge table for dining and work. A lovely 5 course dinner was served, the usual caviar and Dom Perignon champagne. They offer to make the bed for you when it's time for rest, I was able to get 2-3 hours of shut eyes. Breakfast spread was huge and full of choices. I chose the Chinese congee. Plane arrived on time, fast track card provided. My luggage was amongst the first to appear, I am very happy with their service and food. The price of this ticket was only equivalent to HKG to SYD direct on business with another big carrier."

Have always used Thai Airways for my annual Jan/Feb holiday to Thailand to escape China and the Chinese New Year. Have always enjoyed their flights and they have recently begun to upgrade planes from older A330s to B777 on many Asia regional routes. I flew from CAN to BKK on a new B777, good ground service, comfortable seat next to exit for my height, good IFE with plenty of choice and the food and drink was very good value for money, no complaints. Transit in BKK was well organized and not too long with no delays. For the BKK to LHR leg we were on an A380, the cabin was large and spacious and I was again allocated a seat with extra legroom, found the service on the long-haul to be just as good even with more passengers. Overall would highly recommend - especially for tourists as they are mostly catering to tourists especially for long-haul routes so you'all find plenty of tourist literature and information on the IFE before you land."

Security and immigration lines were short for BKK so we arrived at the gate early. Thai tends to lose control of the boarding sequence. Not really a bad thing as tests show that open boarding is the most efficent. The cabin crew were gracious and helpful as we boarded. A crew member offerd us exit row seats just before departure. A very kind offer giving us unlimited leg room. Our vegetarian meals were tasty and suitable for a three hour sector. Service was prompt and friendly. The majority of our fellow passengers were members of two Chinese tour groups. Although the groups were a little excited and not used to air travel the crew managed with good natured ease to getting the passengers seated etc. Excellent job.

Due to late arrival at KLIA, the boarding didn't commence on time, and on top of that, they announced some sort of unspecified technical problem which eventually delayed the flight by over one and a half hour. During the flight, there was no apology from the cabin crew, just a casual mention from the Captain about the delay mid-flight. Onboard meal is nothing to write home about these days, but it's an airline meal in economy class so what do you expect. Upon delayed landing, the aircraft taxied to the far end of the airport without any gate and sat on tarmac for another 20 minutes or so. 200+ passengers had to get to terminal by bus, just after midnight. Many passengers on this flight missed their next connecting flight to elsewhere. The misery did not end there yet. They announced onboard that the baggage collection carousel was number 11, but in fact, all luggage were put on carousel 23. Passengers were waiting near carousel 11 for a long time until a few of us checked again and informed all."

I was excited to be using a Dreamliner for the first time flying from Bangkok to Brisbane. I was very impressed with the quietness in the cabin, the seating and the tricky window tinting. I was also looking forward to some good Thai Airways service and food after using budget airlines on this route for a couple of years. I realize that cabin staff can have a bad day and the crew were efficient but it wasn't what I remember Thai airways service to be. But my biggest disappointment was the food.

On the last leg of my travel to Australia a had the old 747 Jumbo, travelled in Upper Deck. In this 747 configuration the space for hand luggage was very limited, but the crew was aware of that and helped every one in a very efficient way to store the luggage and all with a Thai Smile and efficiently. This crew made all the difference to my previous 3 flight experiences on my way to Australia and back to Europe. All crew members, but especially the crew director on the Upper Deck, did the Extra Mile for every passenger and always with a great and genuine Thai Smile. Even the seat was not so uncomfortable anymore. And the Thai Food was one of the best I had on a plane: beautifully presented, fresh and hot when it was supposed to be hot (in temperature and taste). Based on this flight experience one can only recommend Thai Airways for future travel."

The seats were old, not comfortable and no flat bed. Entertainment was pretty basic, not Business Class Standard in 2016. Second Leg from Bangkok to Brisbane in new Boeing 787. Very disappointing seating for a new aircraft with a 2:2:2 configuration in a row, so no free aisle access from the window.

✅ Verified Review ,,Business,Economy Class,PNH to LPQ via BKK,June 2016,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  This past year a friend and I booked travel on Thai Airways to get from Phnom Penh to Luang Prabang via Bangkok. Although we could have saved money by taking the same route on Bangkok Airways, we chose Thai for its reputation and service record. A few months after we booked our tickets, Thai discontinued their flights from Bangkok to Luang Prabang, our destination. Yet remarkably, although the airline reached us easily via email and had all our contact numbers upon our initial purchase, no one from the airline contacted us when the flight from BKK to LPQ was discontinued. When we checked in at the airport in Phnom Penh for the first leg of our trip (TG 581), and we asked for boarding passes through to LPQ, both the check-in agent and her manager simply shrugged and said they were ""not available.” Arriving into BKK and looking for the now-disappeared TG 576, we were grateful to be handled by an admirably competent Transfer Desk Agent who spent half an hour rebooking us onto a later Bangkok Airways flight. She was the only bright light in an otherwise poor Thai Airways experience. We arrived late into LPG and poorer for having overspent on tickets with an airline that wasn't concerned about honoring them by keeping us informed. Multiple emails to Thai Airways over the past three months, asking for a refund in the difference in fares, or maybe just a basic apology for a remarkable oversight, have gone unanswered."

Flew Thai Airways instead of taking a flight in business class with a connection because of my schedule requirement. Took the risk of flying economy class. Instead, I have never been more happy in economy before. At check in, the staff was nice and fast but seemed inexperienced. But that's just a small problem in an amazing flight. I reserved a seat during check in which was a window seat with my mum, but I found out there was no window and immediately complained to the purser who sorted out the problem as soon as the flight was boarded. The seat was really comfortable seats with a PTV and footrests. The 34' legroom is excellent, no need for an exit row. The plane was delayed due to a door fault, but the purser kept us informed. The food was plentiful, and above expectations, but was only served one meal and several drink rounds. Instead of having to call a flight attendant for a drink, I was awake so she was able to spot me and asked me what drink I wanted. I enjoyed every moment of this flight. Attentive crew doing drink rounds every half hour, and a comfortable (enough) flight. Much above expectations. However, my mum's bag arrived when the business class bags arrived, but my bag arrived almost twenty minutes later! Still, doesn't bother me that much. If you want to fly cheap and still get good service, fly Thai. All the flight attendants were professional. I will try Thai's business class in the future when I get enough miles to upgrade."
✅ Verified Review ,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,BKK to ICN,August 2016,5.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,,3.0,5,yes,6," Bangkok to Seoul. I have flown Thai Airways numerous times over the last 4 years. They have had nothing but my respect for the quality of service provided, friendliness and excellent flying experience. On this past trip I flew with them from Bangkok to Chiang Mai and then Chiang Mai to Bangkok and on to Seoul. On August 26 the flight was delayed leaving Chiang Mai by 10 minutes. The connection time in Bangkok was only scheduled to be 1 hour which made the connection tight and tighter with the delay. Upon arriving in Bangkok there was a line up for transit security however it moved along fairly well. Because of the delay I boarded with everyone else and that was no a problem for me. As I was seated one of the flight attendants was clearly not amused or friendly that I had not been seated before. That Thai friendliness and welcome was not there. A few minutes later as we were taxing for take off the youngest of the flight attendants in business aggressively and rudely barged in to the space in front of my seat and grabbed pillows and rudely announced that they were going in the overhead bin. I have never experienced such rudeness from one of the Thai flight attendants before. This same flight attendant repeated her performance prior to landing in Seoul. I coupled that with the lack of welcome and friendliness upon being seated and it was not the greatest of experiences with Thai this time on that flight. If they were not pleased with the tight connection and my inability to be earlier to my seat, then they should take that up with their airline and not blame me. As for the other flight attendant with the rudeness, she needs to be more familiar with appropriate etiquette. The quality of food, cleanliness of the aircraft were of the same very high quality that I have come to know and appreciate with Thai. Hopefully those 2 flight attendants will not be on my next flight. I can only give a 6 on this rating because of those two persons."

Boarding was organised very well at LHR and once onboard, staff were friendly, attentive and nothing was too much trouble. The aircraft was clean and presentable. Service was great, food was enjoyable and drinks were offered regularly. After an enjoyable 12 hour flight, we stopped in Bangkok where we waited for our connecting flight to Phuket. We boarded an old B777, the aircraft was dirty and needed a good deep clean. The flight was only 1 hour, and the crew did a good job serving everyone a snack and a few drinks before clearing away rubbish within the one hour flight. So far, a good experience with Thai Airways. On our return flight to LHR, we boarded a cleaner A330 aircraft to Bangkok. The crew on this part of our journey back home weren't so friendly, having been cabin crew myself for many years I believe it's important to be friendly and approachable when working in a customer service role. Boarding the A380 at Bangkok for our return flight to LHR was a pleasant experience, we were upgraded to emergency exit seats at check in due to my partner being 6ft 6 which was very nice of the agent. I was flabbergasted to find that the crew moved a family of six which included three young children under 5 into the emergency exit seats next to us, who were nothing but disturbing for at least 6 hours of the flight home. The adults could not control their young children! This family even had the cheek to moan about the cabin crew, who may have been slightly miserable but were still working hard to serve everyone as quick as possible. Many people were disturbed by this family, and I was disappointed as they could have moved this family elsewhere into other empty seats towards the rear, other airlines do not allow under 16s into exit seats due to emergency reasons so I was extremely surprised to learn Thai Airways have different rules. Other than the disturbances, I would entirely recommend Thai Airways especially if you will be flying on their amazing A380!"

The aircraft on this route was excellent, with what seems to be a freshly updated cabin with lighter tones than previously experienced, giving a feel of space. The seating layout is perfect, with all seats having aisle access. For couples, every second row of middle seats are together. Seats are completely lie flat and good room and width. The seat controls are among the best I have seen, and are built into the table next to the seat, so close to operate, and far enough away not to knock while asleep. Food was an improvement over previous experiences on Thai, but not brilliant. Cabin service was mixed - the head steward introduced himself individually to all passengers which was a nice touch. Very high quality product, up against stiff competition in that part of the world."

Check-in in Frankfurt was fast and friendly. Boarding could be more efficient would they really enforce the boarding by rows. Inflight service came fast. They offered to refill the drinks 4 times. For each sector of the coach cabin they have a seperate cabin crew serving the sector. So after 1hour 15minutes after take off the trays were cleared. Some other airlines did not start service until than. Seat is comfortable with enough width (I am 186cm tall) and more recline than other airlines. The inflight entertainment could offer more German videos on this route perhaps too much for the Asian taste. Breakfast was also served very fast. After some waiting time at immigration in Thailand the bags were on the belt. In general nothing to complain. Almost same experience on the way back so I would certainly recommend this airline to South East Asia. Would also mention that both flight departed on time. The return flight arrived 15 min early in Frankfurt.

I reached the airport a bit early and the First class check in counters were not open as apparently they open up only after the lounge opens at 5.10 am. Anyway the staff were nice and check in was done in the First class area while the staff offered us cold towels and water. You have a separate area for security and immigration for premium passengers and we were taken to our lounge on a buggy! The lounge staff greeted us in typical Thai hospitality and offered a selection of breakfast items from an i-pad menu. We also had one hour free usage of spa services which was excellent. the flight was slightly delayed and the pilot kept us informed. However the inflight service was very disappointing for First Class. A very limited menu for a 6 hour flight and they ran out of choices very soon. Something which should not happen in First really. Crew were ever so gracious but that does not serve it purpose really. Seats are comfortable and the amenity bag was very good. Toilet was spacious and well maintained and they offered free WiFi cards for usage of 20 mb. If only the catering could have been of a higher level then this flight would have been exemplary.

The seats and cabin was very clean, all the items where in the seat pouch along with the Thai magazine. I  reclined my seat and stayed asleep from the edge of Thailand till we entered Russian airspace. This meant that the cabin crew did not wake or disturb anyone, and the seats were very comfortable. The IFE movies were an OK selection. The IFE map was also standard. The food on the way to Thailand was tasty, I had chicken with fried rice, it was excellent! I tried a fruit platter on the way home and the fruit was a little dry however, but the croissant made up for it.

What surprised me most was that the menu of Business class was better than the one in First from every aspect. The toilet of the A380 is extremely spacious and well kept.

Having used most Gulf based airlines when flying to and from South East Asia over the past three years, accepting the inevitable transfer time-wait until the next leg, I thought it was time to experience a change. So, for my recent flight from London to Bangkok, I booked with Thai Airways which now operates the A380 – and of course, flies non-stop. Travel to Heathrow by road from my home in Mid Essex, is always a bit of a gamble with regards to allowing sufficient time to arrive. The now ubiquitous delays on the M25 have to be allowed for, which I did on this occasion and reached Terminal 2 just before 0800hrs, for my scheduled departure at 11.50hrs. To my disappointment and surprise when presenting myself at the check-in desk, was being told that the flight would not now depart until around 15.30hrs. 'Late coming in from Bangkok', was the reason. That I had not ben informed of this long delay, was irritating, as my personal contact details were available to them. Putting all this behind me (but not looking forward to waiting around the airport for almost 8 hours) I spent the time as constructively as possible, particularly sending notifications to the Bangkok car airport transfer company, the hotel I'd reserved and the company with whom I had an appointment the following morning. Once on board, it was immediately apparent that the cabin crew were well trained, polite and helpful. The A380 aircraft is a big beast and the internal configuration design is appealing. Long haul flights like this one exceeding 11 hours, are never easy to bear but I have to say that Thai Airways have provided all possible features and amenities to soften this burden. My seat was as good as it gets, the entertainment system worked perfectly with plenty of choice - and all meals served to a good standard. Noticeably, a press of the seat call button produced an immediate appearance of a member of the cabin crew, an occurrence not always experienced when flying with some airlines. The plane actually made up a little time, which meant arrival at Bangkok was three hours behind schedule. So, as to the flight itself, I have no complaints, rather to compliment the professionalism of the crew for making it as comfortable as possible. With my Asian itinerary completed, it was time to return to the UK. On arrival at the Thai Airways desk, I was extremely pleased to be offered a space available cabin upgrade. The return journey is always some hour+ longer than the outward leg, so lounging on a wide seat, sipping champagne and nibbling caviar-covered biscuits, is not to be sneezed at. Such an upgrade was especially welcome, as I had suffered an injury to my left ankle. Once again, I found the crew's performance to be as first class as the cabin and after eating, I extended my seat, snuggled under a blanket and slept for almost six hours. In summary, both flights were seamless and comfortable. They get a ten out of ten from me. Had the Heathrow departure debacle not occurred, the entire experience would have gained the same marks."

After take off was asked if I would like a drink - yes a beer please - which appeared and was poured with the question. Would I like her to leave the can? My wife also had to request that the can of coke be left. Dinner chosen and for some obscure reason cabin crew have allocated their service format so that in my case I had finished my meal before my wife had been served hers - even though we were sat next to each other. No wine was offered on this flight or on our outward leg, so perhaps an economy drive is in situ. Breakfast menu was shown and requested the Thai omelette and a cup of coffee - the coffee came and when clearing cup I was asked if I would like another. I declined, another coffee came but no breakfast! Was not in the best of moods so bit my tongue but did mention it to cabin crew member who stated that she was the purser - who then said sorry! Have since related this to Thai Airways but not holding my breath as still waiting for a response, other than an automated one from customer relations for an email sent on 19/02/2016.

A first for me to also be tapped on the arm (as the service approached me from behind) to ask what I wanted to drink and subsequently eat.  The 'poke' didn't happen once but twice. Astonishing. The service was interrupted twice by turbulence. This delayed the service by 60 minutes at least and you could tell the crew were getting tetchy as they tried to make up for lost time (ie. crew rest time) as they literally threw the desserts and coffee at me. Food was poor quality for a J class experience. The wine selection was also very basic. I've previously stated that TG J class is a leisure-play carrier, and whilst nothing wrong with that, be aware if you're expecting something better.

,A330-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,BKK to KBV,January 2016,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,5,yes,8,Bangkok to Krabi return with Thai Airways. We booked early and managed to get a great deal with Thai Airways. They fly wide body jets on the short one hour domestic flight between Bangkok and Krabi and both the outbound and inbound flights were very pleasant. The outbound jet was newer and had in-seat screens (showing the flight map) whereas the the inbound jet was older and had large cabin screens (the audio during the safety announcement was very crackly and inaudible). The service was good and on both flights we were given a small lunch box with a roll and juice. It's interesting on this flight as some passengers were in transit from international flights and some (like us) were domestic. This meant that when we landed in Krabi we were separated and transferred to two different terminals.

The domestic lounge in BKK is pretty basic both in terms of furnishings and food/beverage options. No fast track. However boarding organized and priority boarding for Star Gold enforced on both flights. The 777's offer great comfort on this busy domestic route with good seat pitch and IFE. Lunchbox and hot drinks provided with a smile. The lounge in HKT is a welcome relief considered the inadequate seating space in the domestic departure terminal. Considering the low fare I payed, must say that I am very satisfied with Thai Airways."

It was our first time in an A380 and we were well surprised by the environment of the cabin. Lots of seats in 2 different parts but the seats are well organized to keep some discretion. The cabin crew was welcoming, the food very good - Thai food - and a large choice of beverages. It was a good flight and we will probably choose this airline if we go back in Thailand."

With Thai Airways you have to ask a blanket or a headphone if you needed one. If the person in front of you reclines their seat you have to adjust your TV also. The stewards are accommodating and I was grateful how they handled the person who won't budge on my child allotted seat. My luggage was left at Bangkok because of a delayed flight from Manila flight, and Thai Airways deliver my luggage at my hotel. My 8 year old son cannot handle spicy food and the stewardess gave him a business class pasta. My experience has its hassles but I admire and commend how gracious the Thai Airways staff."

In Thai Airways premium economy you get a wide seat, a lot of leg room, and this makes the extra money for premium economy worth it. Other benefits are separate check in, lounge access, and the food was surprisingly tasty. But  for 11 hours, it's about the seat. If you can afford it, do it."

The food is rather limited and the seating limited but it still provides you with a place to quietly do your emails while you wait for your flight. I enjoy flying Thai Airways, particularly on this short route. The planes vary from the Boeing 777 to the A330, but it's always a widebody and while demand for seats is high, the planes are clean and comfortable. They've kept the seating in the 777  3-3-3. Full meal service in this short flight, blankets, pillows and PTV.  I've started to see full-service airlines in short routes that won't offer all this. Overall, very good flight, on-time. "

The first flight was with a slightly outdated Boeing 777. The seats seemed quite old and the IFE screen wasn't too responsive. We got lunch and dinner which were very tasty, with premium spirits on demand. The crew seemed quite impatient and weren't too responsive when one put their light on. The second flight was very different though, on a brand new A380. Very comfortable, modern seats. A great IFE with a remote control. Dinner and breakfast were served. Breakfast was fantastic with warm bread and croissants and the crew this time were very attentive. Overall very satisfied with Thai for taking me across the globe and would definitely recommend for ultra long haul journeys."

To add to that the passenger in front of my husband insisted in having his seat back the whole journey except for a very short time during one meal - the seat was virtually in my husbands meal, the crew did nothing until I asked them to and then it was for a very brief time. Because of this we asked at Bangkok for an upgrade to Business Class on our return from Bangkok to Brisbane, and paid an extra A$1046 each for this upgrade. The seats were roomy and service good but the food was a disaster. The entrée was scollops and vegetables - scollops were cold and the vegetables cold. I ordered the prawns and husband ordered veal - the prawns were strong fishy tasting so I swapped with hubby (who will normally eat anything) even though I don't normally eat veal - the veal was very thick and not able to be cut. Breakfast was an omelette with frozen fruit! We have flown Business with other airlines and meals have been fantastic - economy on other airlines has been better than what was served up to us on this flight. "

Not lay-flat, it reclines to a steep angle with a horrible foot rest that unless you keep constant pressure on it will keep retracting. Not easy to sleep on your side. Very poor design and not worth the money for business class, or up to the standard of what is expected in 2016! The food was also poor compared to offerings from other airlines. The business class food on Thai matches economy class on other airlines. The Thai Airways Business Lounge at Bangkok Airport also had very cheap food."

The service is outstanding, cabin crew always have a smile in, they act very quickly on your demands and provide solutions immediately. The food was amazing, one of the cabin crew even brought me a Thai dessert just because I was curious about their culture. The seat was really comfortable and the entertainment very updated.

London to Bangkok was delayed after boarding at gate 30 minutes, due to offloading 1 passenger and bags. Smooth bording considering a very full capacity flight, food offerings were plentiful and enjoyed as were the refreshments on regular offer. Slightly surreal that the pilot woke us up to all countdown for New Year whilst at 41,000 feet and then we had Rod Steward singing auld langs syne over the plane's PA followed by a Thai song! If only bubbly had followed? What a nice touch Thai Airways. Thai are doing well in terms of customer service onboard, if only Bangkok Airport immigration would staff up accordingly when having many flights arriving together - extremely slow and frustrating to see just 8 officers on duty when there must have been more than half available desks vacant considering our flight had 500 passengers alone. Over 1hr to stand in line is not acceptable for an airport so obviously busy!"

Plane was new, nice seats and a good selection of films and flight informations. Very light load, only 26 passengers in Economy in the A380- so nearly everyone had one row available to use it alone. Service was very good, hot meal, a few drinks and very nice FAs. Sadly the flight was delayed by 45 min, there were no reason or any apologies given for this - thats not the right way to communicate. Captain only told a few words about the flight route. All in all Thai Airways offers a good product with high prices (even with same full service carriers like MH or ET) - but everyone who doesn't care about the price and look at the service would like Thai Airways!"

Thai Airways Boeing 747 is due for retirement soon and it shows, seat was a bit tired, firm. Seat back TV unusable.  My moan is the food, as it was tasteless and inedible. Come on Thai, you are home to some of the worlds best food - and no Thai food option offered out of Beijing? The flight attendants were professional and friendly and rustled up some cereal and milk for my daughter. A lot of locals don't understand the etiquette of flying and it was interesting to see the flight attendants deal with this in a calm professional manner. Returning back soon with Thai on a Boeing 777 - looking to compare food and flying experience on the B777."

I chose the airline because it serves Bangkok Suvarnabhumi International Airport. Then, the price was cheap and acceptable. The ground staff and the crews were extremely friendly and helpful. The inflight meal and the entertainment were also good. I was surprised that they fly the route using the big aircraft. In addition, the cabin appearance was nice and clean.

This is a direct flight to Perth which leaves Bangkok just before midnight arriving just before 8am in Perth. The cabin is comfortable with nice passive lighting changes, windows are dimmable, seats are flatbeds and super comfortable. Screen is large but difficult to turn off and stay off as the hand console is positioned at elbow height in the seat rest. Service was excellent and a full meal and drinks was offered an hour into the flight. I would have preferred to have the lights dimmed immediately in the cabin on takeoff so sleep was an option. In any case, light turbulence made sleep uneasy for several hours. Morning wake up at around 5am Perth time. Full breakfast option was available but I took the ready made sandwiches which were tasty. The Boeing 787 is a very nice aircraft to fly, somewhat quieter than the 777."

Check-in was efficient as both ways had a separate seated check-in area with a lot of counters. No queue at all. Had business class tickets, but after boarding we were upgraded to 1st class. Online you can't book 1st class for this short flight, so I suspect they cherry pick from business class and fill 1st class (instead of just leaving 1st class totally empty as some airlines do). Seats are located in the nose of the ground floor of this 747 in a 1-2-1 setup (though as it narrows down to the front it becomes 1-1-1 and the 1st row is 1-1). Seats are not new but comfortable nonetheless. Wide from seat to feet. TV screen is of good size and has a good video selection. Also for my 11 year old daughter. Didn't really liked the TV remote, though it did bring back good memories from the 90's. Food was not 1st class but business class food instead. This is understandable as all  were upgraded from business class. The kids ignored the food served but the chocolates with the meal were well received. Choice and flow of drinks and tidbits were endless. Staff was super nice and attentive. Every few minutes they'll come by and offer their services, till having said ""no thanks"" a few times and they'll leave you alone. Boarding of this fully booked 747 (it was just before the King's birthday) was orderly and quick. The Singapore lounge was disappointing. They have their own lounge but it's small and has not much to eat. It doesn't have it's own toilet, so you'll have to walk out (not far) and use a public toilet. The Bangkok lounge was better. Large and good choice of drinks (available at the bar, just outside the actual lounge, but can consider in lounge area). Free 30 minute massage at an actual spa was an extra bonus. But again, not much choice of food. Perhaps my review is not very objective as we've received free upgrades, but it was a pleasant experience so that's what I report on."

Porters were at hand to help you with all the luggage, check in was done in luxurious comfort of their own exclusive area. A very genrous 50kg allowance which was very hard to exceed. Perks also included personally escorted to passport and security control, and buggy car transfer to the gorgeous Royal First lounge. From there on, very attentive service from made to order meal to one hour complimentary spa, all are part of the ticket price. This lounge is one of the nicest I have ever been on any airlines. Elegant and tranquil, easily could spend few good hours there. Onboard the service is just as good as the ground. Dom Perignon champagne offered, a lovely 5 course meal, yes, even for a 2 hour flight. This is by far the cheapest first class ticket in the world as far as I know. Money well spent indeed! I would have given a full 10, had it not been I was using their 10 seats older version 1st class, which was still very comfortable."

The United first lounge used at Heathrow is in a different league from the old SAS business lounge, the cabin on the A380 is good, though there is a strange lounge space at the front that appears to serve no purpose. But the catering is a disappointment. With only a total of five pax in first, my first choice of meal was unavailable as only three were loaded. The second choice (or pork) was so overcooked I didn't eat it. The serve-yourself food selection in the lounge was just some nuts. The cabin attendants were polite and attentive and very professional. But how can a country with such fine cuisine be let down on food by its flag carrier?"

Food was ok but again basic. Lovely safe flight but staff did not smile and were just going through the motions. Its a pity because the Thai people are so nice."

After a night flight from ISB to BKK and no sleep, plus a wait time of 12 hours between the last flight and the next, my son and I stayed over at a Bangkok Hotel to freshen up and catch a couple of hours sleep. When we returned to the airport to check in for our next leg from BKK to SYD we were told our passports are confiscated unless we paid 1400 baht (700 baht each). After we paid this amount, our passports were returned to us so we could continue our journey to SYD. We could not understand the reason for this as we had paid our airfares in full, including all airfare taxes. English spoken by the Thai Airways staff was not very good so hard to understand them. They advised me to contact our airfare agent to get the refund, which I thought at the time was a ""buck pass"". I contacted our agent to ask them for a refund, which we were advised to do by the Thai Airways check in staff, but they said they have never heard of this charge before and are unable to refund the 1400 baht to us.

Crew friendly meal service went fast but now Thai Airways are not what they were before with the quality of food compared to other Asian carriers. The main meal was tasteless and small portion with some strange combinations, the breakfast had no choice so it was just to eat it or go without. I took Thai Airways at short notice mainly as they had a flight from Manila to Oslo, but with more time next time I will shop around and get a cheaper Asian carrier with better meals and inflight entertainment - as all the movies were not the latest box office hits. Thai Airways was good before but needs to improve in the competitive Asia market as there is so many other good airlines out there."

What are Thai Airways playing at - one pays around £2,500 for a business class ticket and a full meal service is not provided! If they are serious about turning around this airline they should look at improving service to fare paying premium passengers, not the opposite. Costs can be reduced by for example dealing with ridiculous overmanning at ground staff level. The plane and seating were excellent. The staff did their best and were apologetic about this failure to provide an appropriate level of service to premium passengers. There are getting on for 20 other major airlines flying between BKK and LHR. With competition of this magnitude one would think that Thai will need to reconsider this new policy quickly."

Despite the crew not being so friendly, I would still recommend Thai Airways. Thai Airways l have to improve on their inflight entertainment."
,A380,Couple Leisure,Business Class,BKK to LHR,November 2015,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,,4.0,3,no,5,Bangkok to London Heathrow with Thai Airways. Flight departed around 45 minutes late. The cabin crew were welcoming and friendly although their chatter behind the curtains of the kitchen area were quite bothersome when we were trying to sleep. The cabin crew who looked after our section was superb and very attentive making you feel really quite special. The cabin temperature was just right throughout the flight. The food selection was particularly disappointing with a very poor selection of food available. There was no main meal but a selection of snacks and breakfast for the 12 hour flight. Totally inadequate especially if you have been travelling to reach the airport since the morning. That said I felt the crew were also embarrassed by the measly offerings. The cabin was well staffed and there were plenty of crew around to help. They all seemed to be quite happy and content making the passengers feel valued customers. The seats were 180 degree lie flat beds which I found a little cramped around the foot area. The configuration is 1-2-1 on the upper deck although there are around 60 passengers so it does not feel so personalised. Entertainment was the same as the outward flight and the same as offered in October. The screens were responsive to the handset and again it was great to watch the plane land and take off by camera set on the rear of the plane. Wifi is available at a supplement so we never bothered with it. The seat was relatively comfortable although I felt uncomfortable at times especially when sat up trying to read. It was a bit alarming to find that a passenger had boarded the plane with a ticket stub stating a wrong flight number and wrong seat configuration although it turned out it was the correct flight but the seat number was completely wrong.  I wondered why this had not been picked up on the two screening areas before he reached the aircraft.  While overall the flight was good I would go as far as saying that was due to the crew rather than facilities and standards provided to its passengers. It used to be a pleasure to eat on Thai Airways but sadly that does not ring true today.

Flight departed more or less on time. Cabin crew excellent, smiling and attentive without being intrusive. It appears that the airline has gone downhill vastly since the last time I flew with them. The menu choices were unremarkable and the standard of catering was totally inadequate - the hot meal was actually served cold. Previously the standard of catering was above average with delicious tasting dishes but there is a major cut back in the food presented. I would go as far as saying it was dire. Entertainment the same films on offer in November as October. Not very interesting selection of films to be honest although I had no problems using the handset to choose what I wanted to watch. I enjoy the camera view of take off and landing. The seat was a lie flat bed although it was a tad on the tight size especially at the feet. The seat configuration in business class on the upper deck is 1-2-1, the middle rows can be either cosy or quite far apart. The massage facility did not work in my seat. Would I use Thai Airways again? Probably not. I would not rate it as a 4-star airline now. It is the staff that make this airline such a success and I cannot praise them enough."

,A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to BKK,November 2015,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3,yes,7,"London Heathrow to Bangkok with Thai Airways. The aircraft was clean and tidy. The seat pitch is less than in previous aircraft and this makes for a less comfortable journey. The cabin crew were excellent and excellently presented. The service was first class with meals presented efficiently with the Thai smile and regular service of drinks throughout the flight. The crew walked around the cabin on regular intervals. However, the standard of food has declined from the time when salads and vegetables were part of every meal to now when pasta, rice and potato salad seem to be the mainstays. It is for this reason I cannot give full marks to the airline. Perhaps cost-cutting could be made in other areas than the necessity of food."
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,VTE to RGN via BKK,November 2015,3.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,We flew from Vientiane to Yangon via Bangkok and so did one of our bags. The other went to Pakistan and we still haven't got it back 3 days later. These things happen but the customer service was and is appalling. There is no phone number to contact on the Thai website. The unhelpful staff at the airport told us we would have to come back to the airport to collect the bag if it ever arrived and that we would have to pay for the taxis. The airline has never tried to contact us and it was only the very helpful staff at the Strand Hotel in Yangon who have managed to find out any information.
,A380,Business,Business Class,FRA to BKK,October 2015,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,"The business class seat layout on the upper deck of the A380 is 1-2-1. The seats are comfortable and recline 180 degrees, unlike their earlier business class seats. Excellent service with professional staff who were attentive but not pushy. Thai Airways were definitely very good value for money."
,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Kathmandu to Bangkok,October 2015,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,5.0,4,yes,7,"Kathmandu to Bangkok with Thai Airways. Flight on time with my luggage amongst the first off the plane. Check in was efficient and I was allowed to change my flight at the airport and immediately check in (attempts to contact Thai Airways in Kathmandu and Bangkok on a Saturday and early Sunday were unsuccessful). Cabin crew did not seem overly friendly compared with some of the other airlines I have recently flown. They did the job but did not seem to want to go that extra mile. The service and the food was okay, but not to the standard I would have expected from Thai Airways. The seats were angle flat and the choice of movies were OK. Headsets were not collected until late which was good."
,Boeing 747-400,Solo Leisure,First Class,Bangkok to Hong Kong,October 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5.0,4,yes,9,"I arrived on another Thai Airways flight from Kuala Lumpur and got transferred to this one. An agent was there at the tarmac (we did not park at the aero bridge) with names of first class transfer passengers, we were taken on a separate van to the airport main building, transferred onto a golf buggy, through security and to the 1st class lounge. All the way we were personally escorted. That part of the service was truly amazing, and more than justified for the extra I've paid. In the lounge a private area, somebody took our food order, an hour of free Thai massage if you have the time. The lounge is a true haven of peace and calm. When it comes time for our boarding, we were personally escorted again to the gate, and onto the plane. FAs greeted us warmly.  I got the older version pod seat, but it's surprisingly spacious and very comfortable. Lovely Dom Perignon champagne welcome and other goodies. An extensive menu and wine list.  Food was well presented and delicious like dining in a fine restaurant. Only disappointed with the small AVOD screen and control. I heard they have now a newer version first class more private seats."
,Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok,October 2015,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,4,yes,8,"First time flying on the Boeing 787, Thai Airways does a wonderful job with its interior and impeccable service. Menu was given out. A delicious hot meal (3 options) was served and was delicious. Cabin air feels fresher, and the auto-dim and larger windows are very impressive. The seat can turn into a full flat bed, and is quite spacious. Shame it's only a short 1:40 hour flight. If on longer route they use this aircraft, it can be a really good option. All in all, a delightful experience."
,Boeing 773,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Bangkok,October 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"I flew TG 831 from SIN to BKK on October 30th. Despite the aircraft showing its age, all I can say is we received Thai hospitality at its best. Cabin crew were caring and looked wonderful in their typical uniforms during boarding and service, food was delectable, a warm meal on a two-hour flight. I believe Thai Airways have the best economy class food in the air. Newspapers were distributed on this early evening flight, who does that nowadays? Thai will definitely have my business in the future whenever I have the option."
,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Heathrow to Bangkok,October 2015,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2,no,4,"Really disappointed at the service. Firstly, they kept assuming we were Thai and spoke in Thai all throughout the journey which we couldn't understand just because we have an oriental face. Secondly the food they served when returning back to London was below standard as the chicken casserole was bland and tasteless. It was a big let down as thought Thai Airways had a good reputation. The seats were not too comfortable but ok."
,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Bangkok,October 2015,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,10,"Thai Airways was an amazing airline. Our family flew economy from Melbourne to Bangkok return with Thai Airways in September / October. Everything was great, though the temperature in the plane was a little warm on the return trip.

I always flew domestic and the service was different. I really like THAI when I flew this route, unlike flying domestic, the food was so delicious and fresh. The flight attendants was wearing very beautiful uniform, their service made me feel impressed and I'm planning to Oslo next year now, and I'm pretty sure I'll fly THAI>"
,,Business,Economy Class,Hanoi to Bangkok,July 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"Thai Airways has probably one of the friendliest crew, and I always like their food. It is not as high-class as other airlines, but is nicely prepared and presented. Taste can be exquisite. Entertainment system is very modern on some aircraft. Flight very comfortable and Bangkok is a good hub."

A steal of a ticket, purchased within 7 days for 450 USD (everyone else has been charging 750 USD for months)! The flight down was on the newer A330 with large AVOD. This flight is always late to depart despite the fact that the plane has been parked at ICN for hours. They pad their scheduled flight time, so we departed 40 mins late but arrived on time - only to not have a gate ready for us at 1:15 AM. The food was surprisingly good. Pork curry. Better than some real food I've had in Bangkok. Also, the movie selection was excellent. The flight back, TG 658, was on a noticeably older 777 (old AVOD). It was a red-eye, so they served a boring croissant sandwich after take off and a full breakfast (bland ham fried rice with Thai style egg) before landing. As it was an overnight flight, you do the best you can to sleep. One major frustration: they never responded to my call bell at any time. I wanted an eye mask and water, but they never responded. This was after food/drink service, so they should've paid attention. "

Flight was almost full and passengers were racing each other to store their carry on items in the overhead compartment. Crew were very helpful in helping passengers locate available overhead compartment. Light meal consisting of salad and dessert were served. I think it was more than enough for such a short flight. Overall, very satisfying experience."
,Boeing 747-400,Business,Economy Class,Bangkok to Haneda,October 2015,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,4,yes,8,"A full flight from Bangkok to Haneda on Thai Airways Boeing 747-400. Seat was comfortable and IFE was so-so. Some of the movies in their inflight magazine were not available for viewing. Light snack was served after take off and breakfast was served 1 hour 45 minutes prior to landing. Two choices were available between fish and omelette and I chose the former. It was really good. Overall, good service by Thai."
,A380,Solo Leisure,Business Class,CDG to BKK,September 2015,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,3.0,3,yes,6,"I flew with Thai Airways in Royal Silk (Business class) from Paris to Bangkok on September 16th.  I checked in online but did not have a printer to print out my boarding pass and had to do so at the check-in counter. The first passenger service agent I talked to seemed clueless when I requested to obtain my boarding pass. He referred me to his colleague who was more eager to serve. Business class passenger services was terrible in Paris CDG Airport. There were two Business counters open but only one line, therefore the passengers who arrived later formed a second line to correspond to the number of counters and therefore skipped 2 parties (myself included) who were in line ahead of them. This is unacceptable as the ground staff were ignorant of the inappropriate manners of the other passengers. When it was my turn to the counter, I simply requested them to print out the boarding pass as I already checked in online, but the agent (who is actually an Air France agent but was serving for THAI) said I had to wait until she can get a Thai Airways agent to check my credit card. This took over 20 minutes and I was stuck at the counter until the other agent arrived. Big thumbs down. The lounge facility was average as CDG is not a Star Alliance Hub, but the staff were very friendly. Boarding was not the best and very chaotic. No announcements for First/Business class priority boarding. In flight service was the best part of the entire experience. I was seated in the last row of Business cabin (upper deck). My part of the cabin was relatively empty and both of the flight attendants were very friendly and attentive to my requests. I was greeted warmly and because I request special meals, one of the FAs asked if I would like to stick with the special meal or opt for the regular. She knew by heart what the options were and was able to provide very thoughtful recommendations. She was probably the best Thai Airways cabin crew I have met on board. Throughout the flight, all the FAs were extremely helpful at navigating the IFE, looking for my lost item, answering my questions, and accommodating my requests without any annoyance. I had a very pleasant flight because of them. I would have given this review a 2/10 if it wasn't for their amazing inflight service. Food was average and not impressed."
,Boeing 777-200ER,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Melbourne,October 2015,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,1,no,3,"My wife prefers direct flights and Thai Airways is the only airline that flies Melbourne to Bangkok direct. This really is a very poor business class on the Boeing 777-200ER. The seats are terrible and not lie flat and trying to sleep on these is most difficult. The entertainment system is tired and options are limited. The food was of average quality This was the most expensive ticket to Bangkok I found, so I was staggered to find the quality of business class so low. The cabin staff were admirable and helpful but couldn't make up for the lack of quality in the cabin."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hyderabad to Bangkok,September 2015,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,3,no,5,"Thai Airways online check in doesn't always work and you can't do any kind of modifications. Customer service in Hyderabad is awful, as they don't have a queuing system when you call. Either it's busy or it rings endlessly. I've hardly ever had anyone pick up the phone. On Hyderabad - Bangkok route you either get a great plane or a horrible one - no in between. If it wasn't the only direct flight between Bangkok and Hyderabad, I would not choose to fly it."
,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Shanghai to Bangkok,September 2015,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,2,no,2,"Flew Thai Airways business class with wife from Shanghai to Bangkok. I am a platinum member but now mostly use Singapore Airlines (PPS member). Terrible food in the business class. Thailand is famous for it's cuisine, whereas this business class food served is so low standard. I had a lamb with potato and my wife had a fish with rice. It seemed the caterers in Shanghai supply food of a very low standard. The cheese and fruit platter is unimaginative and they have served the same for last 20 years or so. No Thai food was served during the flight. What is going on with Thai Airways? No wonder they are not in the top tier airlines. It's a pity that a country is so famous for it's service, food and hospitality yet Thai Airways serves such bad quality food. At Shanghai, the check in for business experience was terrible. Staff hardly greets you even you are a platinum and flying business class."

Food was excellent and 787 is a lovely aircraft. Entertainment was very good and easy to use. Seats very comfortable and flatbeds. Only gripes - lounges in Bangkok and Perth are not as good as other airlines. Transit in Bangkok is a challenge - no ground staff to assist, difficult to know if you are you departing from East or West Terminal? This needs improving - then Thai would be excellent choice."
,777 200ER,Couple Leisure,Business Class,BNE to BKK,September 2015,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,4.0,5,yes,10,"Some time since I travelled Thai Airways which used to be my favourite airline. The service on this Brisbane to Bangkok daylight flight was excellent, food of a high standard, quality wine selection (French) with generous pourings, staff service excellent. Cabin layout attractive, seat comfortable. All in all a high quality flight."
,Boeing 737-400,Business,Economy Class,BKK to VTE,September 2015,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,2.0,3,yes,5,Short hop to Vientiane on Thai Airways Boeing 737. Thai Airways has an issue with service consistency. You never know what you would get. The crew on this flight was average and not living up to the service standard that they're promoting. Another issue is the air conditioning. It was literally freezing cold on this flight.
,A330-300,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Krabi to Bangkok,August 2015,3.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,5.0,4,yes,6,"Krabi to Bangkok with Thai Airways.

,B777-300ER,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Oslo to Bangkok,July 2015,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,4,yes,9,"Thai Airways from Oslo to Bangkok. The cabin crew wished us a warm welcome in the door. My seat was 64A and seat was wery comfortable, with flexible headrest and footrest. There was a pillow and a blanket in your seat. Shortly after takeoff the cabin crew started to serve drinks. It was not only once but it was unlimited. We could ask for more at any time. At meal time, you could choose between chicken currry or pork with rice. I chose pork, nice and tasty, but a bit strong. 1.5 hours before landing, the crew started to serve breakfast - omelette with sausage, croissant with jam, youghurt with musli and fruit salad. It was overall wery tasty. We landed in Bangkok five minutes before scheduled arrival time."
,A320-200,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Krabi,August 2015,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,,4.0,3,yes,7,"Bangkok-Krabi with Thai Airways. It was a short one hour flight. The boarding went smooth and the crew wished us welcome. The seats were comfortable, but it was little legroom. When airborne the crew started to serve the meals. It was tuna sandwich and orange juice. the tuna sandwich was not tasty at all, I only took one bite. There were nothing more special about this flight. In the last ten minutes before landing and during the landing music was played in the cabin. We arrived in Krabi at schedule."
,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Oslo to Bangkok,September 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,4,yes,10,"On boarding my Thai Airways flight from Oslo to Bangkok, I was greeted with a warm welcome by cabin staff. Escorted to my seat, given a hot towel and offered Champagne, newspapers and magazines.  The dinner menu was great, four main dishes to choose from and several wines, white and red. With the cheese we were offered port. The seat can be adjusted to a flat bed, with enough space to turn, which for me essential for a good sleep. I have been using Thai Airways more or less every year since 1979 and have experienced the ups and downs. I will say they are back on track now. They the best nonstop flight from Norway to Thailand."

Fabulous cabin and crew, you didn't want to get off the plane. Highly responsive and graceful. Food was fine and wine was superb. The A380 First seat/suite was very comfortable and dining together was easy and enjoyable. Personal escort through the airport, lounge included spa treatment. Staff in lounge great as was food on the ground. Hard to fault this Thai Airways flight, and the only let down was the quality of the onboard catering - which was fine and plentiful, but lacked a bit of finesse.     ⚑ Thai Airways Ranking "

Food was okay, the seat not as comfortable as some airlines, but service was pleasant and genuine. On time arrival and departure. Brisbane Air New Zealand lounge that Thai use was not crowded for once and is adequate - but will be bigger and better when they move later this year. A very good experience.      ⚑ Thai Airways Ranking"

Seats lack depth somewhat but ok for short flights. Never found TG business class worth paying the difference for. Hate the capsule business class seats. Inflight service is good.

,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BKK to HKT,September 2015,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,4,yes,8,"Was my first flight with Thai Airways flying Bangkok to Phuket, and I was expecting a lot. Check in was smooth with a very polite and smiley ground staff, she let me choose my own seat and was very helpful. The plane was quite old, no IFE but  very clean and spacious and nicely designed interior. Food was enough for the short flight (1hr), in a nicely presented little box. On time flight. I'd say it is great value for money, convenient as you don't have to change the airport. Probably will use it again."
,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Auckland to Bangkok,September 2015,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,3.0,3,no,5,"My Thai Airways flight from Auckland to Bangkok was not as I was expecting after reading some reviews. The Boeing 777 was newly refurbished, clean and on time. The staff were friendly, professional, served the food well and kept the lavatories immaculate. (Great toilets on this plane, about twice the size on many other planes.). But some things were odd. My main course for dinner - a curry, was an economy meal, still in its little aliminium tray, but sitting on the Business Class China. Dessert was an ice cream in a tub, or a chocolate bar. The electronic entertainment is old, murky image and very poor for anyone used to the digital clarity on Emirates and others. And the seat - well, it's impossible to get comfortable in any reclining position in this seat. How it ever went into production I'll never know. The lounges at Bangkok were utterly tragic - as others have written. In the small lounge that has the showers, the three toilet stalls in the men's room were totally blocked! So ugly! In the others, all totally crowded, we all wandered about looking for somewhere to perch. The food is very poor quality. Not an airline I would choose again, especially not at Business prices."
,"Boeing 200, Boeing 300-ER",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Bangkok,September 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"Flew Melbourne to Bangkok with Thai Airways on the overnight flight on a Boeing 200, aircraft slightly showing it's age but the service as always was of a very high standard. Cabin crew gave out hot towels as soon as the plane reached cruising altitude and throughout the entire flight never faltered with their professionalism and providing a service reminiscent of the famous Thai hospitality. First drink round before dinner, then another drinks round after dinner had been handed out. Food was excellent for economy class, with a tasty pork curry served and a breakfast of chicken with noodles or a Western breakfast served prior to landing. Good range of entertainment options too. Despite the older aircraft seats were comfortable and I was able to get some sleep. Toilets kept very clean for the entire flight. On arrival in Bangkok we were taken to airport by shuttle buses. Was very surprised to see a new looking Boeing 300-ER used for the return flight from Bangkok to Melbourne. Seats were even extremely comfortable with good padding, and the larger entertainment screens and modern bathrooms made for an even more pleasant flight. Staff were as always very hospitable and friendly, and always willing to answer questions and to bring around drinks after the lights had been turned off. I have flown with Thai many times and not once have I had a bad experience. Their aircrafts may be dated but the Thai hospitality from the cabin crew always ensures a pleasant flight."

These A320 planes are new but they are obviously configured for secondary short haul route. I found out in the seatmap that they have more seat than Thai Smiles A320. Not really happy with seat comfort offered. Other that that, they are fine. Great staff, enjoyable snackbox with a round each of tea, coffee, softdrinks. Punctuality is perfect."

Very quick check-in both at BKK and in HKT due to multiple TG stands at the airport. Around one hour delay on both flights. Clean aricraft with extremely beautiful Thai interior. Staff very friendly and bearing legendary Thai smile. Tasty light meal consisting of a sandwich, a cake and orange juice/water. PTVs only on BKK-HKT, but on such a short flight there is no big need for those. Plus it was very nice of ground crew that when flying from HKT, a staff member proceeded our luggage not only to BKK, but also on our further flights to DOH and WAW, both flown on Qatar Airways."
,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Business Class,Brussels to Ho chi Minh via BKK,August 2015,2.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,,4.0,4,yes,7,"In business class, Thai Airways are usually very friendly and helpful. Prices are not the cheapest, but they offer 40kg standard checked in luggage + 10kg for silver card. Not bad. However, in my recent flights I noticed that food quality is seriously down. In my 2 last flights to and from Brussel my seats were not the cleanest.  On last flight most blankets had an awful smell.  Each time I got my priority luggage out first, except fishing rod tubes (still within 158cm 3 sizes limit!) arriving at the end, and for my last flight it is still missing. For some long hauls the trips to or from planes are by bus. The Boeing 787 seem more noisy and in business, the configuration does not offer much space for shoulders and feet.  A380 to Frankfurt are most comfortable (space and very low noise). I have always been happy with them, but my wife now suggests we change. "

The positives were the aircraft interiors, the IFE, the punctuality of the flights and the speed of check in. There were some significant negatives: the cabin crews were largely okay but the service they delivered was very robotic, and the food ranged from bland to inedible. I can't really comment on seat comfort, as on both flights I had a full row of three seats to spread out on."

There is also no priority at Noi Bai security, they asked me to wait until the economy passengers were finished and then business could follow."

The crew were very friendly and hospitable. The food was really good as well. I really enjoyed the Thai style pork curry. Before landing, they offered either green tea ice cream or vanilla ice cream to passengers. The IFE was great with a wide selection of movies and TV program."
,A380,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Bangkok,August 2015,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,2,"We usually use Thai Airways for our travels because of their previously friendly and patient service. An argument not to be underestimated when traveling with toddlers. However, for our round trip this time, staff were just below all expectations. Instead of water they came around 3 times with wine. We had to wait 1 hour at Munich airport in the airplane because some passengers (Thai Military apparently) came late for unknown reasons with filled shopping bags. No excuses or explanation from staff. Upon our enquiry we were just told ""We are tired, too."" Entertainment program was not turned on - of course - during the waiting time. Even with a brand new A380, the computer had to be started over and over again until it finally worked. This does not inspire confidence into the board computer for the pilots. To be mentioned that tickets for Thai are not cheap. Overall a lousy experience and we will avoid Thai for next trips."

The breakfast was phenomenal (better than Business Class breakfast on United)! and in-flight snack delicious but very messy.

,A380,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Bangkok,August 2015,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,2,no,4,"The service has became like a ""robot style"", no emotion or friendliness from cabin staff, they only do the minimum or what they are paid for. Food was okay but nothing special for being in business class. Seat was very uncomfortable, very narrow, hard and not long enough.  I am tall, 6'3 and usually my feet don't touch the end of the seat but this time I had to fold my legs. Probably the worse business class seat for long haul I have experienced."

I've been flying TG since the 1990s and while some of the same business class seats from that time are still being used (and these sorely need replacing), the high level of service in the forward cabin from that time is no longer seen. During a 3.5 hour flight at the prime dinner hour, the crew rushed through service of a three-course meal so that all was done 75 minutes into the flight - and then lights out and the crew could retire to sleeping or talking. Food was just so-so. Gone are the days of the fruit and cheese cart - in fact gone is cheese entirely. Dessert is a sad cube of supposed cheesecake and some fruit tart, both on a small plate covered in plastic wrapping (giving it a hospital cafeteria feel). The IFE system is sub-par with limited options for new movies and TV. TG has lost its edge."

Food was rushed, I guess the crew wanted to go to sleep as soon as possible (it was an overnight flight). Food dreadful, main course barely edible. I fly with them very often, and the entertainment offerings rarely change, so had to listen to same music as months ago. Overall, food and entertainment are below average. I had a fee ticket with miles, but cannot imagine paying for such a poor service. The seats are very average too. Underwhelming experience."
,A380-00,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Bangkok,July 2015,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4,yes,8,"We had to wait one hour at check-in queue at Heathrow. A380 seemed nice, new and clean. The in-flight entertainment was fine ranging from Sitcoms to classical music. The first meal of food was fine and edible but breakfast was not so nice for me personally because I cannot eat egg. The staff were fine but not for going the extra mile on this flight. Overall not a bad flight and would fly again but a little rough around the edges."
,A330-300,Family Leisure,First Class,Hong Kong to Phuket,July 2015,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,,2.0,4,no,5,"I've flown Thai in 2001 and I've flown with them again. Nothing much has changed, aside from the newer planes and IFE. The rest is about the same. When it comes to service and resource management they still haven't quite got it right. At PKT check-in, they decided that each counter would have it's own queue. That confuses me since they were for the same flight and this split queue system is known to make wait times very inconsistent. Ground crew seemed very shy, and were not keen on speaking to us, or at least they were so quiet we couldn't hear them, and the same was observed for the cabin crew, who also seemed somewhat distant. Their IFE looks like it's 10 years old, and is due tor an update, despite the system being touchscreen. As for positives, the plane was delayed, but it did arrive on time, so I'll commend them for that, and food is reasonably good. Better than the slop that Cathay Pacific serves to passengers."
,Boeing 747,Business,First Class,Bangkok to Haneda,August 2015,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,5.0,3,yes,7,I like Thai Airways but have always found them to have very uneven service. The check in was wonderful and really created an experience. The Thai Airways first class lounge was a little beat and the food was off but the service staff were lovely. The massage was worth the fare alone. Cabin staff were generally nice. The inflight manager was rude. Never said hello or acknowledged. There were only 3 people in the cabin and he only talked to one passenger. What's his problem? Entertainment was not up to 2015 standard.
,A380,Solo Leisure,Business Class,CDG to BKK,July 2015,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3,no,3,"Thailand has a service culture absolutly unique in the world and TG in some far past had it too but no more. Cabin attendants and pursers give you minimal attention. If wines are drinkable (no better, no worse) food is terrible: instead of serving the wonderful Thai cuisine, TG offers some sort of European style food. Seats are the most positive aspect of the journey: somewhat narrow and difficult to get in and out, they are nevertheless 180° lie flat and no problem. All this comes after an awful ground service, especially in their hub BKK."
,Boeing 777-300,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Guanzhou, China to Bangkok, Thailand",July 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,"Holiday trip of a family of 5. The whole experience has been flawless. Seat comfort, legroom, private space, cleanliness, service and crew on board, excellent food, drinks to choose from (alcoholic and non): everything was perfect. Not the cheapest trip but not the most expensive either. "
,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Phuket,July 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,"I had a very good flight on Thai Airways' Economy Class from Bangkok to Phuket. Thai has a good website and app which I used to check-in, add my ticket to the Passbook app and chose my seat. Since I'm very tall the ground stewardess offered me an emergency row seat, which apparently are kept from online check-in, free of charge when I checked in my hold luggage. I thought this was a very nice gesture and am very thankful for it. The rest of the ground and cabin crew from Thai were also very professional, kind and helpful. The seat was comfortable and thanks to the kind ground stewardess I had all the leg room I needed. Food and drinks were good and tasty. I liked the coconut dessert and the fact that on a short flight there was another round of drinks after the meal. The downside to the emergency exit row was the fact that I didn't have my own entertainment screen. There was also no WiFi available. On this short flight I didn't miss either though. Thank you Thai Airways for this smooth flight!"
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Jakarta via Bangkok,July 2015,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4,yes,9,I have traveled Thai Airways almost 12 times in the last 8 months. Great staff and service. Surprisingly the Indian food served during my travel from Mumbai to Bangkok and Bangkok to Jakarta was much better than most other Indian services that I have tried. Infotainment system is good too.
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Sydney,July 2015,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,5.0,3,yes,8,"BKK-SYD-BKK Easy check-in. Received nice welcome as I produced my frequent flyer card. Decent legroom for economy and seat comfy. Food out superb. IFE ok, but not many films. Decent size screen. Plane had ample toilets including 6 at the back. Arrived Sydney ahead of schedule. Return trip pretty much the same though the food not quite as nice as outward flight. Offers of refreshment plentiful. To me Thai is a top quality airline so book with confidence."
,Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BKK to KUL,June 2015,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,8,"Good experience for this short haul flight. Flight attendants were a bit too fast serving the meal, although the flight is only 1 hr 50 minutes. TG417 on 30 June 2015."
,Boeing 777-300/737-400/747-400,Business,Economy Class,Tokyo to Vientiane via Bangkok,June 2015,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,3.0,4,yes,6,"We flew on the new Boeing 777-300 on the HND-BKK leg and Thai's last two B737-400 on the BKK-VTE-BKK legs. On the return leg to Haneda, we flew the B747-400. Hardware-wise, I think everything was great. The food was good, seats were comfortable, and the plane was clean. The IFE could be improved further though. Service-wise, I would say Thai Airways is inconsistent. On all the four legs flown, I saw cabin crew from the the super helpful and friendly to rude and unfriendly. If Thai could improve on their service, I think Thai deserves another star."
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Auckland to Amsterdam via Bangkok,June 2015,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1,yes,5,"Our flight from Auckland to Amsterdam on was delayed 8 hours and we missed the connecting flights. We were assured that Thai staff would reconnect our flights at Bangkok so that we wouldn't need to do anything. When we finally left NZ (8 hours later) and reached Bangkok we were provided with a hotel room and free breakfast. That was refreshing and much appreciated. However, Thai Airways arranged for our flights direct to Amsterdam via another airline but unfortunately didn't tell us. So we were running around Bangkok Airport trying to figure out where our new boarding passes were, who was flying with whom and when. We also didn't know what happened to our luggage. Finally, it took 46 hours in total to reach Amsterdam (includes delay, overnight stay, flights in transit) from Auckland. Better communication to stranded passengers would have resulted in an ideal outcome as we were unsure as to how long we would be stranded in Bangkok and the location of our luggage. In saying that, the Thai Airways staff on the plane were friendly, food was fantastic, and the ample refreshments were great. We enjoyed the flight service better than the ground service."
,A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Bangkok,June 2015,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,2,no,2,"I am very disappointed by Thai Airways. I have always believed it was one of those oriental gems and that I would enjoy a silky flight. Unfortunately it started very badly as I made an error in the booking and the company charged £100 to correct it. The flight itself was unimpressive, mediocre food, mediocre entertainment and mediocre staff. The crew was unsmiling. At least the flight was more or less on time."
,A380,Business,Business Class,FRA to HAN via BKK,June 2015,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,1.0,4,yes,6,"The new seat design is comfy, only the middle seats are quite close to the neighbor. Food very good choices. Beverages reasonable. Inflight entertainment with lots of films. Monitor does not allow you to tilt vertically or sideward. Headphone is very big and heavy and it does not have the noise suppression. They took the menu after i order the food. I ask for white wine and they just brought any wine, even that they had 3 kinds available. "
,Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Bangkok,June 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"Flew Melbourne to Bangkok return in economy. Melbourne to Bangkok: Hot towels were given out after take off, a drinks round and then dinner was served. Food was decent for economy class. Good choice of inflight entertainment.  Cabin crew were polite and friendly and did their jobs to a high standard. Drinks offered many times by staff, and drinks were available in the galley as well. Breakfast served before landing. Bangkok to Melbourne: Much the same as the in bound flight, crew excellent and several drink rounds were offered. However had to take shuttle bus from terminal to the plane even though the aerobridge was not in use."
,Boeing 747-400,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Bangkok,June 2015,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,4.0,3,yes,7,"London Bangkok Business class. First time in Silk class (Business) on the upper deck of Boeing 747-400. The cabin felt jaded, but in a few days this route will be using the A380, so you can see why Thai Airways are not investing on this aircraft. The inflight service was friendly and efficient, though breakfast felt a bit rushed. Will be interesting to see how the A380 compares on my return."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to islamabad via BKK,May 2015,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4,yes,8,"Thai Airways offered the most direct route from Singapore to Islamabad and the timing is good too. Onboard meal service and inflight entertainment option are good. I enjoy the flights both to and from Islamabad. Only small problems the flight does not operate on a Sunday and price tend to be expensive for this route. It is even more expensive than flying to Europe return. Other than that, I am happy with the flights. The route and connectivity of Thai Airways are very extensive, it can compete with other major airlines if only the price is comparable to others. The same route by Qatar Airways or Emirates always ended up cheaper during the sale time, compared to Thai Airways. Considering Thai Airways using older aircrafts compared to these airlines, the fares must be made competitive."
,Boeing 747-400 / Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Auckland via Bangkok,June 2015,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"Our trip started well in United lounge at Heathrow but we had  poor service on the plane. The Business seats on Boeing 747 were narrow with thin padding and mine wouldn’t recline. The flight attendant wasn’t interested when asked for assistance to fix the seat. He disappeared and never came back. Finally after the meal we got someone to come and they forced the seat to recline but it never worked properly. The seats are nowhere near lie-flat and are quite uncomfortable. There was a limited range of movies and hardly any TV programmes. How hard is to offer a decent range of entertainment? The food was mediocre and seemed the same as you get in Economy. The breakfast was terrible – a hard, fully cooked egg that was called poached on a tough muffin. We were never offered the bread basket. The steward walked straight past us. We had the same disinterested service on our next flight on a 777-300. The food was a bit better but not great. There were no snacks offered overnight. The staff seemed more interested in serving dinner quickly so they could spend the rest of the flight resting and chatting. And seats were even worse. Even fully extended they’re far too short and the footrest flops down to the floor with any pressure on it at all. The most uncomfortable Business seats we’ve ever had. Two very disappointing flights. "
,A320 / Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BKK to CNX,June 2015,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,4,yes,8,"Good journey overall. Outgoing flight is cancelled, but Thai Airways offer a seat on Thai Smile Airways (their subsidiary) with more favorable departure time. A320 are new and comfortable. Snack bag served with bottle water by polite and friendly staff. Return flight on old Boeing 777-300 with generous seat pitch. Snackbox is tasty and adequate for 1 hour flight."
,,Business,Business Class,Manila to Bangkok,June 2015,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2,no,3,The glory days of Thai Airways are gone and have been for some years now. I fly Thai several times a year in both business and economy and find them to be very poor. Unfortunately they offer the only direct flight on some of the routes I need to take. On this particular flight the disappointments just kept adding up. From the poor service provided by flight attendants who were more interested in chatting in the galley to the very poor quality meal and drink selection. For the price they are charging for a business class ticket one would think they could provide some decent wines and video entertainment. Seats are not flatbed and were not long enough for my 180 cm frame. The business class lounge was very poor although not operated by Thai they should not be using 3rd party operators that provide poor food and drink selection and no in site rest rooms. What continues to amaze me is how 2 of the top airlines are operating only a few hours from Bangkok and yet Thai Airways cannot seem to emulate them in the least - how hard is it to go and study what Singapore Airlines or Cathay are doing?
,B747,Family Leisure,First Class,London Heathrow to Bangkok,June 2015,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,"This is the best airline that operates this route. Great food and food choice. Plenty of legroom. Amenities are good. The only thing is that the crew can't speak much English. If you are planning to fly the LHR-BKK route, I would strongly recommend this airline. In a month or so, they will use the A380 on this route, which will be even better."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BLR to ICN via BKK,,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,"I fly often with Thai from BLR to ICN via BKK. And I have enjoyed all of my experiences with Thai. Economy food was very good unlike many other high class airlines. I especially enjoyed the dessert. Cabin crew could be a bit more attentive and friendly but generally good. Communicating with the cabin crew can be quite difficult as they don't speak much English. This can definitely be improved to give more comfortable flight experience to the customers. Otherwise, I will definitely fly Thai again."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,Flew Bangkok - Rome. Start with the good thing: Food was very good and inflight entertainment excellent. The fact that the plane was less than half full helped as you could get a row of seats to lie down and the staff were relaxed about you moving seats unlike some airlines that tell you they cannot take off until you have returned to your seat. Staff were attentive enough but as soon as their duty was done they disappeared to rest. Some were friendly and helpful but most are perfunctory and a little disinterested. Having flown Singapore nothing can match their genuine helpfulness and friendliness. Saying that Thai are better than Qantas who are too strict and not friendly. Overall Thai is good and I'll fly them again.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew BKK-AKL on older 777-200. Expected a tired old plane and variable service: hurrah for low expectations. Seat was angle-flat but surprisingly comfortable. Crew were super-attentive and nice. Food was some of the best I've had in the air.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,TG 282 from Koh Samui to Bangkok. Service at the airport was polite and nice. Business class booked and paid for full fare. The seats were the worst I've seen. These BC seats were smaller than economy legroom. We were asked to move from the 2nd row of the plane to the first row as our 2 inch recline of the seat meant that a child could not open her tray table in the BC seat behind ours. We've cancelled all remaining Thai flights as a result.
,,,Premium Economy,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,5,Flew PEN-BKK. J class has been discarded. Now only Premium Economy and Economy. So lounge access. Too bad if you have a J or F class onward connection on TG. Fried rice for breakfast - no choice. Wine could not be served as they did not load a wine bottle opener. Seats same as Y except middle seat kept vacant.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,,,3,no,3,"Cabin crew have lost the genuine smile and welcome. They were somewhat rude. On our SIN-BKK leg (TG404 28 Apr 2015) while clearing the trays one of them spilled coffee onto my husband's seat (he was in the restroom). I immediately motioned to the crew but was ignored. Soon afterwards I pressed the ""Attendant"" button but none of them answered the call. After about 10 mins I eventually used my own wet tissue to remove the stain. On the BKK- SIN leg (TG409 2 May 2015) I was a little unwell but waited till all passengers had boarded and the crew were doing the round before take-off and asked for a blanket. The crew gave a nod but did not return with any. After the flight took off and crew left their seats I reminded another crew member that I asked for a blanket. She just glared at me and mumbled a little and went to the rear. A while later she dragged a plastic bag of blankets obviously just routinely giving out blankets to those who might not even need them for such a short haul. Finally I got mine not because I asked for it but because it's the routine! I'm really disappointed with their service - so unlike 20 years or so ago when I would happily fly by the then Thai International if it served my destination."
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,2,no,3,I as very unhappy with the service on TG628 from Hong Kong to Seoul on April 24 2015. The flight was fairly empty in business class (only 6-7 passengers). Staff were not friendly and inattentive. I saw cabin attendants asleep in the business class seats while I was trying to look for service. During the flight no water was offered and I needed to keep asking for it. On TG 629 from Seoul to Hong Kong on April 26 2015 the flight was marginally better but the service was rather disappointing. The staff member collected the tray but left the empty glass the table-mat and other utensils behind. After 15 mins I had to ask them to collect those. Just surprised how she could be so inattentive given there were very few passengers in business class on board.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,KUL-BKK-KUL (B787 Dreamliner). Legroom was excellent! Meal was great and plentiful. Cabin crew was friendly and helpful. Inflight entertainment was one of the best as compare to other airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Reading some previous reviews and as a very nervous flyer - I was quite worried about flying with Thai Airways. I can honestly say however that I had a brilliant experience flying with them and in most aspects I wouldn't set it apart from the likes of Emirates or Ethiad. The staff were friendly and helpful - even putting up with those annoying kind of passengers who keep wondering up to the kitchen etc. The plane was clean and kept so throughout the journey. Inflight entertainment was great the same as I would expect from Ethiad/ Emirates - plenty of new releases etc. The flight was smooth and enjoyable. Would fly with them again.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,MUC-BKK April 2014 - Older 747-400 was tired. Unfortunately the business class is 2-2 which means window passenger has to climb over the aisle passenger to get out which isn't easy when bed extended. Seat wasn't as comfortable as I expected would have been nice if they were true lie-flat. Service and food were good boarding process for Thai seems very chaotic they could be more organized with that.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,BKK-DEN April 2014. 777-300 was spacious. Suvarnabhumi airport is nice until you get to the boarding areas they feel like they are still not finished and airport has been open for almost 10 years. Food and service were good lounge was nice and thankfully had decent showers which were nice after an overnight flight to BKK. Took advantage of the massage service in their spa very nice.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,no,4,BKK-ICN-LAX. Business Class. Absolutely inferior hard product (seat) compared with competition offerings. This old 777 had Business class seats that would only angle recline (not 180' lie flat). The seats were narrow seat back bolsters were malfunctioning and overall caution material was hard and uncomfortable for such a long flight. The cabin was kept uncomfortably warm for the entire flight despite requests to lower the temp. The food and beverage offered was average. IFE was ok. Service was good not great. Quite frankly there are many better choices for Business Class between LAX and BKK. Cathay is much better and more convenient too.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Flew on Thai Airways Boeing 777-200ER TG 434 CGK-BKK on 24 April 2015. No delay on it and I got Thai's Hospitality from ground staff in Jakarta airport. Plane was good colourful seats beautiful cabin crew with their Thai traditional dress. Meal was impressive - delicious. IFE was good. Flight arrived 30 minutes earlier than scheduled. Overall In my opinion its highly recommended.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,TG 620/625 BKK-MNL v.v. Enjoy the flight in general. Nice meal great service from attentive and pleasant Flight attendant. The aircraft B777-200s seemed a bit worn out even though they are recently retrofitted. PTV system get stalled and need reboot sometimes. However seat pitch is great and I can comfortably catch some sleep both way.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,2,no,6,On 28 Mar 2015 TG930 BKK-CDG A380 (CDG-MRS with another airline) seat 37K. The plane departed from BKK with 40 minutes delay so my luggage could not make my final destination in MRS due to very short transit at CDG. The flight was not full so middle seat were not taken but unfortunately a passenger just took it for herself. Food and drink outbound were ok. However flight attendants completely forgot to clear the tray from my seat due to the lady sleeping with 2 seats! I pressed the call button for someone to take the tray away and a lady came and took it with an unpleasant mood. During the flight only one or two rounds of drinks were served. Before landing no hot towels were given and then breakfast was served they ran out of my choice so I had to take something else which was ok and kind of edible (enough). Apart from these miserable flight attendants attitude and lack of food and drinks the plane is new in good and clean condition seat was wide enough for 5ft 9 man with good leg room although pitch was not much compared to other 4 or 5 star-airlines toilets were clean. Overall rating for outbound BKK-CDG I give 6.5/10. Inbound flight on 5 Apr 15 TG931 CDG-BKK seat 75E upper deck it was a completely different story. Flight crew were friendly and attentive. Food and drinks were plenty and hot towels were given before landing. A gentleman next to me seemed to have problem with his seat and food. Flight crew were very helpful trying to get what he needed including sandwiches during the flight. Overall of this trip was great. I could rate this journey 9.5/10.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,5,LHR-BKK-LHR. I have always been a big fan of Thai but have to say was left feeling disappointed on this occasion and will consider other carriers for our next trip. 747's are very old and looking worn out going out my IFE was broken. Food service has gone down hill with no extra little touches provided anymore and quality has diminished. Service - what has happened to that Thai Smile attitude - service was functional and once dinner was served cabin crew just sit in Galley chatting until breakfast service. I can see why Thai is losing out to the Middle Eastern airways and if someone from management actually reads these reviews I urge you to invest some of that amazing Thai hospitality back into your airline!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,Just flew Thai Airways Intl from Perth to Bangkok return. Aircraft was one of their new Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Could not fault anything about the experience - but flying on aircraft less than 6 months old doesn't hurt! Meals were plentiful and enjoyable - cabin service impeccable as usual. Inflight entertainment first class.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew MEL-BKK on 777-300ER aircraft with full flat beds / direct aisle access for all seats. Excellent hard product with exceptional sleeping comfort and very nice cabin ambience. Food and beverage of a good standard. Good service at the airport and no delays.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew with them March 6th 2015 (BKK-MNL). Service was great food was excellent. What made this trip excellent are the FA's who have an eye for detail and anticipate passenger needs. MNL-BKK was quite delayed but we arrived on time in Bangkok. The food is not that good compared from the BKK-MNL flight. I noticed also that they didn't serve drinks before landing at Bangkok whereas my Bangkok to Manila flight FA's served us drinks. As an OFW (Overseas Filipino Worker) leaving the country means leaving your family and loved ones and it's a difficult thing for most of us and it did happen to me. I felt so homesick that I cried during take off and one FA noticed this and when we reached cruising altitude this FA came and asked me if I'm okay and I told her everything was fine. To my surprise she came back and gave me a glass of juice.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,4,PEK-BKK in business old but upgraded 747 upper deck with new seats and new IFE. Service was faultless and forgettable. Nobody went the extra mile or even the extra inch but we got what we paid for. Nice seats and nice food I can't remember what we had and that probably sums it up well.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,7,BKK-KIX - A333 - Online check-in did not allow printing. However check-in counter service was excellent no lines place to keep handbags etc.. Lounge could have offered more choices of food and drinks but was comfortable with large leather seats. Seats on board were not fully flat however comfortable. Excellent food and a good choice of European wines (much better than ANA). IFE rather limited but interactive. Flight on-time. Long lines at KIX for immigration (be aware).
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,We booked a flight with Thai Airways from Phuket to Bangkok with the intention of catching an additional flight from Bangkok to Saigon with another airline. The flight from Phuket was originally delayed 15 minutes but we didn't start boarding until 4.45 (we should have been departing at 4.30). When we got to Bangkok we could not land so we flew around for half an hour until the runway was clear. We landed an hour after we were expected to and ended up missing our flight to Saigon. When we talked to the customer service desk they said it was our fault for us missing our flight and would not do anything to assist us. Very unimpressed with the service and would not recommend taking Thai Airways.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,Terrible: how the once quite-good Thai has declined. Bangkok to Sydney on an old 747 with partially reclining seats. The food was almost inedible service was croaky and the comfort levels poor. Service on Thai to Europe at least has flat beds and a reasonable meal selection: the was shoddy.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,Flew SIN-BKK and return. Thai Airways should be proud of the food it serves on its flights. For a short 2-hour flight between Singapore and Bangkok the food was excellent! For the SIN-BKK sector I had the prawn in chilli paste with rice option. The prawns were absolutely delicious. The meal also came with a tasty omelette fried with basil leaves and a pasta salad with ham. On return from BKK I had the chicken curry option which was another winner! This was served with white rice and a side of boiled morning glory. There was also a delicious side of chicken salad. Rarely do I enjoy inflight food and this is one of those rare occasions. What a great way to start and end a holiday!
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,5,yes,8,BKK-Chiang Mai-BKK. B777 / A3333. Everything nice nice food etch except very aggressive lady at check-in at Chiang Mai airport with no priority tag.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,2,Out on 18th January return 2nd March. Both flights on the 747 as our son is a full time wheelchair user and can get to seat on lower deck without transferring to an aisle chair. Terminal 2 a nightmare as no assistance was offered and signage is poor. 747s being phased out not before time as both flights the seats were stained and cabin in need of a good clean. Out to Bangkok again in July and looking forward and hope this flight on the new A380 if we can access the upper deck in business class with our son and cabin crew have improved. Food on a par with most airline food - uninspiring! Inflight entertainment kept dropping out and had to be reset 3 times. We fly with Thai 2/3 times a year to Bangkok and sorry to say the service seems to have got worse on international flights.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Thai Smile BKK-UBP in economy. Very pleasant and efficient service for this one hour domestic hop. Far superior choice than either Nok Air or Thai Air Asia out of DMK. Suvarnabhumi is much easier and more civilised than Don Mueang and much more convenient if you have an overseas connection. Check in was relatively easy short queues through security and spacious comfortable concourses and gate seating. Clean comfortable A320 with attentive efficient service. Far superior to the old Ryanair B737s flown by Nok Air on the DMK-UBP route. Would recommend.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,TG 911  30th Jan 2015. Inbound flight TG916 on 27th Feb 2015. I have been married to my Thai wife now for 25 years and we have both travelled with Thai Airways for most of those years. I have just returned on TG916 on the 27th Feb 2015 and it is so sad to see an airline as good as this going down in quality. The food ran out the audio didn't work one toilet was out of order to the the extent the flight crew actually removed the toilet pan right next to my seat. When I said my audio did not work staff checked it and totally agreed with me but did nothing to help even though the flight had 9 unused seats. I know Thai people do not like to lose face but this service loses face for Thailand. What a shame.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,10,CMB-BKK TG 308 26 Nov 2014. BKK-CMB TG 307 3 Dec 2014. I traveled from Colombo to Bangkok and then Bangkok to Chaing Mai (round trip). Everything was excellent. They have a variety of food and beverages of good quality. Customer care was pleasant and good. The toilets were not very clean which maybe due to the passengers' way of using the toilet. Other than that everything was good. I recommend this airways for anyone who is willing to travel comfortably.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,6,Flew DEL-BKK-SGN and return. Each of the legs had some shortcomings which was a big letdown compared to previous experiences with TG. The DEL-BKK leg was on an ageing A340-600 with particularly uncomfortable seats and obsolete IFE. The screens were low definition and barely visible if the blinds were up (it was a daytime flight). On the plus side food (other than the dessert) and the service was fine. The BKK-SGN leg was by stark contrast on a new B787. Owing to the short duration no headphones provided so the fantastic IFE is largely inaccessible. Cold box meal was adequate for an hour long flight. In comparison the aircraft for the SGN-BKK flight was a tired A330 with hard seats and no IFE. The B777-200 used on the BKK-DEL leg was far more comfortable and modern but it had the worst food on any of the legs including the cold meals on the Saigon flights. Service was functional but seemed rushed and was brusque on a couple of occasions. It was a full flight but I haven't had the crew on other full DEL-BKK flights be as snappy as this set was. That set and the ground staff at Bangkok airport diminished a lot of the goodwill from the good service on the other flights. Overall IFE needs to be improved to keep up with other premium competitors but still stands head and shoulders above Indian competitors on the same routes.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,FRA-BKK-RGN-BKK-FRA Legs on A380 and 330. One of the A330 was very worn and dirty however service on all four sectors was efficient very friendly and overall of high quality. Highly recommended.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,Flew from London Heathrow to BKK and return. Absolutely terrible. On the 11 hour night-flight there the seats were uncomfortable and cramped and the staff were extremely rude. My entertainment system did not work and when I asked to move I was ignored. No toothbrush/paste or eye mask provided. I did however believe that this could be just a one-off bad flight. I tried to upgrade to business class for the 13 hour flight back to LHR but was (rudely) told it was full. The return flight was just as bad if not worse than the first flight. My entertainment system did not work again and the staff were just as rude. They seemed to disappear for around 6 hours during the flight (it was not a night-flight either) leaving us with no offer of even a cup of water. When I eventually asked for a cup of coffee I was brought (20 minutes later) a stone-cold one. Dinner was served 2 hours before landing although our row of 3 was served around half an hour after everybody else - I think w e were forgotten as we had to ask for our food! When we eventually got our food they had ran out of the beef option leaving only the seafood option. As I don't eat fish I asked if there was any other option at all before being told I would just have to go hungry! Absolutely terrible from start to finish. Will never fly with them again nor recommend them to anyone.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew Chennai - Bangkok and back. The Chennai - Bangkok sector was operated by an old A330. There was no personal entertainment system but the crew were friendly and prompt in their service. Hot delicious meal served in-flight. The captain kept the passengers updated on the flight status and arrival time into Bangkok. The return leg was operated by a new A330. This one has a personal entertainment system with a good selection of movies. Cabin crew quite helpful and attentive. Hot and delicious dinner served in-flight. On this leg the captain kept providing regular updates on the flight status and arrival time into Chennai. Landed on time in Chennai. Overall good experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,OSL-BKK and return. Outstanding cabin crew delicious food and very good IFE. Best flight experience I have had in many years.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,,5,yes,8,BKK-HKT and return. Despite such short flights (slightly above 1hr) the service is still very good. BKK-HKT delayed by approx. 40 minutes to allow passengers for late connecting flight from Tokyo to reach it. Return flight on short 20 minutes delay. Apart from those on-time issues little to complain about. Plenty of space on widebodies (777-300 on BKK-HKT and A330-300 on return) no IFE (only route map available but you do not need much more on such a short flight) light and tasty meal consisting of sandwich delicious coconut or orange cake and non-alcoholic beverages. Still you receive a pillow and a blanket. Very nice staff (at HKT they even checked our luggage for further flights with QR to DOH than to WAW) and even cabin design is a pleasure for your eyes.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Returned to using Thai this year after a 3 year gap. Travelled LHR - BKK in January returning in February. My return was sealed by Thai Airways new baggage allowance policy of 30kg and a switch back to newly refurbished 747s. As a scuba diver this means I can now carry all my kit without going via the middle east. At check in on the way out I was asked if I was satisfied with my selected seat. I was offered the alternative of an exit row with greater leg room. I took this and found I was the only person in the whole row which was good as these seats are slightly narrower than normal. I therefore had room to move my elbows to eat! On the return journey I was again offered an alternative to the seat I had reserved another aisle seat but with an empty place beside me great. Good leg room and if it wasn't for other passengers selfishly punching the touch screens and bouncing in the seat in front it would have been perfect. I cannot blame Thai for other passengers behaviour but maybe a note saying these are touch screens not punch bags would help!
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,HND-BKK in C BKK-NRT in First. After coming off UA F from SFO the TG business class was a huge improvement. The sense of style and presentation that was absent on UA was here in spades and the crew was warm inviting and ready to provide for any special request. The flight to NRT in First was on the A380 and the lounge ground staff and spa were simply unbelievable-worth the price of the ticket alone. The meal which I pre-ordered (lobster thermador) was superb and every aspect of the flight was delightful.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,"Flew Business Class from BKK-CDG on the A380. The flight left and arrived in Paris on time however the experience was not what was expected and I was left disappointed. The food and service in Business class was awful and it started with in-attentive and grumpy staff that looked like they had not slept in days and had no interest in offering the ""Royal Thai Service"" the seats were very cramped and was not comfortable even in the flat bed position. Food was terrible and felt just as if it was from economy class but served on a plate. Thai Airways is having a tough time at the moment and from this experience I can see why. They are always one of the most expensive airlines and coupled with this terrible service and quality I can't see them getting out of their ditch anytime soon. Long haul from BKK next time will certainly be on another airline even if there is a short transit."
,,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,London-Bangkok return TG911/910 19/12 and 17/01. Refurbished 747-400r with mini suites offering more privacy than the older open plan style. Excellent service throughout on both flights. Food perfectly ok if a little dated although I loved the pre-booked menu for the return flight to London including a Thai style duck curry. I much prefer the older 747s to the A340 in first as the latters cabin is much smaller and uses the older seat style. London Heathrow was a joy in the new terminal two where we use the United Globalfirst lounge. BKK Royal First ground service excellent as always. Probably my last trip on the 747 as the A380 is being introduced from July 2015 although this may lead to the reduction of the two daily flights to one only.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,LHR-BKK out on the 27/01/15 and returned on the 01/02/15. What an improvement LHR terminal 2 compared to Terminal 3. Be prepared for the long walk to the aircraft allow at least 15 minutes to get to the gate. TG 917 was only half full which made the overnight journey very comfortable. Food was better than previous flights. Seating was good but temperature was very warm which made sleeping not great. Arrived BKK 45 minutes early which was a nice positive. Overall very pleased. Returned on TG 916 flight left on time plane was pretty much full but still had enough space to fell comfortable and not cramped. Food was decent again with no issues. Lunch plus sandwich and dinner was served on the long journey home. Plane landed 25 minutes early. Entertainment better but not at the level of the Emirates. Another good flight. Both flights were good with very few issues we paid the extra to fly direct and well worth the money.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew Perth to Mumbai then Delhi to Perth in January. Excellent service on all sectors. Delicious food. Excellent entertainment. Comfortable seats. Very friendly flight attendants. Brought drinks through regularly. Even the coffee was great. Forgot to check in a specific item not permitted as hand luggage. Confiscated by security in Delhi. Went to flight gate and discussed with Thai staff member who arranged for the item to be checked in at great inconvenience as the walk was far. Very appreciative.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,Flew between BNE and HAN/SGN via BKK on Thai Airways. The Boeing 777 had a nice clean interior and had spacious leg room perfect for the long nine hour flight between Australia and Thailand. Flight Attendants were nice enough and were quick to respond to passenger requests. IFE had a decent selection of new movies and TV shows enough to entertain me throughout both long-haul flights. Unfortunately on the return journey my screen went dead five hours in and there was nothing that could be done to fix it leaving me to watch the remaining half of my movie on my friend's screen. Between BNE and BKK food was plentiful and tasty however on both of the shorter flights the 'cold lunchbox style' food was really quite bad and a little inedible. Disappointing. With this being said I did enjoy all flights with Thai and would recommend for long haul flights. In terms of standard just a little below other Asian carriers such as Singapore and Cathay.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Flight attendants were friendly and helpful with lovely smiles. The service overall was excellent. The food and the seat was okay. They should give all customers a toothbrush/toothpaste and an eye shade without having to ask. Overall it was a nice trip.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,2,"Thai International BKK-MEL 19 December 2014. Check-in at BKK was easy and the staff friendly although the agent forgot to return the ticket printout. On time departure using Boeing 777-200 although the aircraft was showing its age looked quite scruffy and in need of a thorough refurbish. Crew were surly and had no interest in providing service in fact they gave the impression that the passengers were an inconvenience. IFE worked but the programme selection was very basic even the latest release movies were ""old"". Haven't flown long haul TG for sometime and based on this experience wont be doing it again soon."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,2,no,3,TG602 Bangkok-Hong Kong was incredibly uncomfortable the worst seating experience I have had. There was a time when I went out of my way to fly TG. I won't be doing that any more. Awful.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,TG916 BKK-LHR on Thai Airways A340-600 aircraft. For a 13 hour flight (14 plus 1 hour delay!) seats in economy were incredibly uncomfortable and entertainment box under the seats were irritating. This is a complete contrast to their B747s which although older seem much more comfortable. Luckily this particular flight was half empty so I was able to attempt to sleep on the two window seats. Staff made up for the discomfort. As usual they were very attentive and friendly. Food was a little bland but not inedible. Entertainment was great - the same as the inbound leg which was still enough to last me the full 14hrs! All in all not a terrible experience. It would've certainly been better had it not been for those awful seats! The A346 is a beautiful plane but its seats are not designed for long haul flights!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,TG629 & TG602 (HGK-BKK-HKG). Outbound flight was delayed due to a group of late arriving passengers. As a result the flight arrived late in Bangkok. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful. Good selection of food although the portion was quite small. Adequate inflight entertainment system. Overall the trip was satisfactory.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew MEL-BKK. (Return in Economy). When you fly with Thai you're guaranteed excellent service and very comfortable seats in economy. The cabin crew are friendly and warm and very efficient during meal service. The hot towels given to economy class passengers is a nice touch. The seats are very comfortable with adjustable head rests and good leg room was even able to sleep during both flights. Food was decent with a beef curry with rice offered after take off from Melbourne and chicken noodles as a choice for breakfast. On my return flight from Bangkok to Melbourne there was only one breakfast option on offer which was chicken sausage with scrambled eggs and this was the only meal which was below standard The egg was too runny and the spinach was burnt. Cabin crew on both flights were excellent and very friendly and spoke excellent English assisted me in putting my heavy suitcase into the overhead bin. Unlike the crew on some airlines who disappear right after the meal service the crew walked down the aisles with trays of water and juice after the cabin lights had been turned off and promptly bought me my scotch and coke when requested. Thai is truly a world class carrier with the best cabin crew.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew TG484 PER-BKK (Economy) and then TG920 BKK-FRA (Business). Flight to BKK was good in Economy had an exit row the service was quite good though some cabin crew were more friendly than others. The food was ok there was a choice of 2 options for lunch and the IFE was fine with some good selections and a wide variety. The flight in Business to FRA was on the A380 and I loved the seating with lots of space and the seat was easy to operate between the various positions and put down into a bed to sleep. Heaps of room for storage which is great. The service was good and the crew were friendly and helpful. On the food side of things I think Thai lag behind some of their competition in terms of quality but there was plenty of it with a 4 course meal followed up with a hot breakfast served a couple of hours prior to landing - I did not go hungry. I think Thai could improve their wine list. All in all good flights. The IFE package on the A380 is also excellent.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Flew on the FCO-TPE route with B747 from Rome to BKK then A330-300 from BKK to TPE. FCO-BKK-FCO route Biz class only 30% seats were occupied crew very attentive friendly. Food very good hot towels 4-5 times. Seat on B747 in sleeping position very uncomfortable only recline approx.160 degree lack of legroom very difficult to sleep (I'm 192 cm). BKK-TPE route A330-300 seat very good IFE also very good. Service also very good even if biz. class almost full. On the last flight to FCO my bag was the 1st one on the carousel. I recommend Thai.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,BKK-ICN. Delightful as always. While on the ground before the flight I went to the spa for my massage - truly a plus offered by TG for premium passengers. The crew was gracious and the flight was most enjoyable. The A330 the seats do not recline 180 degrees but I was able to sleep nonetheless.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,5,no,5,TG628/9 in December 2014 both flights by old 777-200. Flights on time. Meal from HKG to SEL was still frozen and not edible from SEL to HKG was very average the kids meal was much better on both legs. Wine in minuscule glasses no small usual bottle supplied. Seats OK movies not the latest but ok! Not a 4 Star airline anymore! But was cheapest for the time out of HKG.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,Flew from Vienna to Bangkok then on to Melbourne. Absolutely terrible experience as I was told at Vienna that I would not be sitting with my children from Bangkok to Melbourne so upon arrival to Bangkok went to the ticket desk and a nice man sorted it all out so that I could sit with my kids. When we boarded a very rude hostess said that my daughter could not sit in the exit aisle without a parent sitting next to her. I was travelling alone with my four children and the man sitting next to my daughter said that he was happy to take care of her in case of emergency and I was only separated from her by the aisle so I could easily reach her. The hostess insisted on one of my children moving because the plane was full and we could not all be moved. My children were very distressed because one had to move and none of them wanted to sit alone as you can imagine as they are all under the age of nine. I was so upset at how insensitive this hostess was forcing one of my children to sit alone a three year old. I will never fly with Thai again disgraceful.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,I bought round-trip tickets from Singapore to Bangkok for $265 which was a really great bargain. TG 404. 9th December. The aircraft model that operated this flight was a Boeing 777-300ER and the seats were pretty comfortable for a 2 hour long flight. Pillows were found on every seat. The entertainment system was responsive and the food was excellent. The taste was great and they came in pretty big portions. I was full before I even got to the dessert. It's a pity no menu was given out though. The cabin crew were a little rushed but generally pretty friendly. TG413. 13th December. I was lucky enough to grab a seat on the Airbus 340-600 which is such a gorgeous plane and one of Thai's most coveted aircraft models by aviation enthusiasts. The seats were definitely not as comfortable as the ones found on the Boeing 777-300ER but good enough for a 2 hour flight. The entertainment system wasn't as responsive and was reset a few times which was annoying to say the least. All in all Thai Airways IMHO is a really strong competitor with Singapore Airlines on the Singapore to Bangkok route and I would fly with them again.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,3,ZRH-BKK on November 14: on this route Thai use an old Airbus A340. Seats were of the old 'slide down' style in a very dense seating configuration. No storage space in the seat and no direct aisle access for the window seat. Overall the seating was more like premium economy. The wine choices were good but unfortunately food quality and presentation were of low quality. Choice in the inflight entertainment system was limited. I was surprised that they would use such bad equipment for a route with a very long overnight segment on the westbound route. This choice became even more puzzling when on my connecting segment from BKK to PVG the plane (Boeing 777) had a much more modern business class product with flatbed seats for a much shorter daytime flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,Flew on the LHR-BKK sector (TG911) with B747 after not having done it in a long long time. I was frankly a bit worried at first having read some of the negative reviews but to my surprise - worth every penny! I personally found the staff to be the best factor on that trip so attentive friendly and welcoming. For me that made up for the uncomfortable seat and the slightly bland meal(s). I will give TG credit on making an effort to sort me out a veggie meal at the last minute (I hadn't pre-ordered it) - yet TG went the extra mile to satisfy me as the passenger. Inflight entertainment was brilliant too! So many choices! I'd definitely fly them again and recommend that you fly Thai!
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,TG418 from KUL to BKK and TG 642 from BKK to NRT - Business Class. 777-300ER and new 787. 777-300ER aircraft with older style seats but still comfortable. Flight boarded only 15 minutes before scheduled departure but using 2 jet-bridges they had the door closed and pushed back on time at 21.00. Smooth take off and prompt dinner service by smiling flight attendants. Good food and friendly service for the 2 hour flight. Good AVOD entertainment on large screen and tons of legroom. Landed on time but taxied to a remote stand which was irritating as there were at least 15 airbridges in the Thai area that were free. Bussed to the terminal and long walk to connecting flight. Used the Thai Royal Silk Lounge - good food but awful seats and so crowded. Tiny lounge for being the hub of the airline - and used by other Star Alliance passengers. My travel companion and I spend 15 minutes in there and preferred to sit in the terminal. TG642 to Narita was boarded by bus so again a long bus ride to the plane. Amazing new 787! Warm greeting upon entering and led to seats. Comfortable pods with a lot of room and amenities. Take off just after midnight for 6 hour flight - meal served quickly and very delicious. Service perfect - smiling attendants and they predicted your next request. Slept 3 hours comfortably and with individual air vents keeps your seat area cool. It's ridiculous that many new planes come without the air vents. Breakfast an hour out of Narita and once we landed short taxi to the gate. Really the best Thai flight out of the 3 I took on the round-the-world journey.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Hong Kong - BKK TG 639 Business class. Lovely flight. The upgraded cabins are warm welcoming and modern. The Thai staff were attentive and efficient. Welcome drinks were offered including a second round and service was efficient. Because of the flight time (dinner time) and the relatively poor selection of food in the lounge at HKK the meal service has room for improvement. Thai has the best flight times between HKK and BKK and you can consistently snag an a decent price in the royal silk cabin without too much pre planning. Wouldn't hesitate to fly THAI on this route in the future. Have never failed on service in my experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,I travel to Thailand at least once per year with my wife and always use Thai Airways. The primary reason for this is they have a direct flight from Brisbane. In the 7 or 8 flights I have undertaken during the past 4 years I have found the service to be consistently good if not outstanding seats comfortable and the food more than satisfactory to very good. I always buy my tickets direct from Thai Airways and I find if I monitor their website I can purchase tickets as cheap is not cheaper than any other agent/organisation. It is also easy and quite inexpensive to amend your ticked if you book direct even if you are on a discounted fare.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,7,TG 475 BKK-SYD B744. Full Flight. Nov 29 2014 in economy. FA's good. Thai does it well. IFE just adequate but the system is clunky and unresponsive. But and it is a big but the seats are appalling. Zero padding on the seat back. It literally feels light thin cloth on the plastic shell. Just a tip you order a seafood main meal you get a seafood breakfast?
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,TG 920 FRA to BKK. Business Class A380. Used the Lufthansa Senator Lounge which was great. Took a shower as I had arrived from Chicago on UA and the facilities were excellent. Good food and plenty of seats in the lounge. Boarded upper deck of the A380 and warmly welcomed by the crew. Hot towels offered and a drink before take off. Was in the last seat of the Biz Class (27 K) and enjoyed it - the small economy section behind is nice as they don't allow children there so it is quiet. The food was average but had good flavor. AVOD Entertainment had plenty of movies and TV shows to watch on the 10 hour flight. The attendants were very friendly and accommodating but I was surprised that after dinner and before breakfast they never came through the cabin offering drinks and snacks. If you went to the galley they would happily deliver whatever you wanted to your seat but even on American and United they come thru every few hours with water (and that is in economy). Landed on time and bags out quickly. Overall a good flight and the A380 is so quiet.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,2,no,2,Very negative experience Thai Airways is very pricey and their service is getting poorer over the years (I'm a Gold member and I often travel with them). They now switched back to old 747 from Bangkok to London and despite flying business I hardly noticed any difference with the economy class in terms of quality. Seats are very narrow and not very comfortable the video screen for the onboard entertainment is noticeably smaller than for other seats and old (also difficult to return to its stowed position without any difficulty). Old movies (same as few months earlier). Food in particular was very poor and with little choices (I had better food on economy class in the past) and service was also very poor compared to the past (little care to details). This should probably be my last business flight with Thai Airways.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,,,3,yes,7,11/11/2014 TG 921. 17/11/2014 TG 920. I have just come back from a first class flight from Frankfurt. It was the A380 a very good plane. The seat is excellent so is the service. I can not say the same about the food. In Qatar business class you get better food and selection. For the first time Thai Airways did not offer a drink list! I thought last week on my flight to Frankfurt that was just forgotten but no no more drink list - very poor!
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,6,SYD-BKK TG 476 B744. Minimal delay on departure early arrival. Very full flight but great cabin crew. Food OK but it's plain plane food. Cabin crew presence and hydration runs very good. IFE so-so but for a 9 hour sector I could find enough to watch. However the seat was the worst that I have ever experienced in my way too many years. Seat back had literally no padding! The metal bar mid thorax was obvious through the thin fabric. Two blankets and a pillow made it tolerable.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,yes,8,BKK-SGN B787. Short 1 hour sector on new comfortable craft. Snack box meal service. No head phones for the IFE? Light PAX load nice crew. Slightly late departure on time arrival.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,Very good experience flying from Stockholm-Bangkok-Koh Samui-Bangkok-Stockholm. Loving the new B777-300 aircraft. Good vegetarian food. Great service and friendly cabin attendants. No complaints at all.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,yes,6,SGN-BKK TG 551 Nov 24 A320 Operated by ThaiSmile. Short sector little over 1 hour. Snack box meal service was OK. Full flight with very tight seating. Cabin crew good but had trouble asserting themselves to have electronics shutdown for take of and landing with the north Asian passengers speaking mandarin being very uncooperative. No IFE. Remote stand with over 20 minutes to terminal. Congested immigration of course not their fault.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,TG931 Paris - Bangkok A380 Business Seat 19K. Departed on time and Business cabin was around 75% occupied. Very good FAs on this flight service was well organized and the crew were trying hard to please the passengers. A word of warning to fellow travelers flying Thai A380s avoid seats 24B and 24J these seats are right opposite the toilet doors and I have observed many complaints from fellow passengers wanting to move from these seats.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,I flew from Melbourne to Chiang Mai on a very cheap discounted ticket bought on the Thai website. At check-in I was asked to show the credit card I had used to book the flight. I was able to produce the credit card so no problem. Thai is not the only airline to insist on sighting credit cards but I would prefer it if they had better fraud prevention methods than that. At check in I also asked for an exit row aisle seat and was given one - no problem and no request for extra money. Two meals were served on the first flight to Bangkok both offered choices for the main dish and my choices were both tasty. The staff did numerous water/juice runs throughout the night and the washrooms were kept spotless. The seats were quite hard but I did sleep some. On arrival in Bangkok I cleared Immigration and then - after the brief flight to Chiang Mai - customs in Chiang Mai were a breeze. Thai has always been and still is a decent full-service airline in my opinion.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,New Boeing 787 aircraft between Perth and Bangkok return. Usual first class service by cabin staff who were quick attentive and nothing was a chore. Food was of good quality and ample. Thai however have missed the opportunity to configure seats to avoid window passenger hurdling aisle passenger to use amenities. Although lounge facilities in Bangkok are excellent the use of the Perth lounge operated by Qantas is unacceptable. Lots of alcohol but little edible food. Thai better off providing $20 food voucher to be spent at airport cafeteria.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,3,no,5,Heathrow/Bangkok/Heathrow business class. Average at best. Disappointing lounges particularly Bangkok with tired furniture and decor. I have never before been in a business class lounge when you couldn't get a glass of wine! The flight accommodation was not good with uncomfortable seating which did not covert into flat beds. On the outward leg the cabin was reduced to darkness after the first couple of hours into the flight despite it being early afternoon which made no sense (except perhaps for the cabin staff). Same on return but quite acceptable as this was a night flight. Half way through the flight the toilets ran out of hand towels. On both flights the service seemed rushed. We have had much better experiences with other national carriers particularly Singapore and Emirates and will not be flying with Thai again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew TG921 on October 22 and TG102 on October 23 TG103 and TG638 on November 8. I can never say enough good about Thai Airways. This is the third year that I have flown with them going between Canada and Chiang Mai. When I have requested window seats they have gone out of their way to see if it is possible and they have succeeded. The central office can make that happen on international flights and the gate agents make it happen for domestics. In Chiang Mai they were respectful and very helpful and the same in Bangkok. Onboard the service is second to none. The food is great and the quality of onboard service is great. Whenever I can make it happen I fly Thai and the airline's courtesy matches up alongside of the wonderful people and country.
,,,First Class,,,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,3,NRT-BKK on A380. This was my second (and hopefully last) flight in Thai first class. They should just not be allowed to call it first class business class on Singapore or EVA is better. Last year I flew Thai from ZRH-BKK on A340 and was disappointed - I thought maybe I just had an old plane and a bad crew. Turns out it's the standard for Thai. A380 is a fairly new plane but it was already quite worn. The F cabin just isn't designed that well - there is a lot of wasted space on some lounge in the front that no one used. Much better to put another bathroom in that area like Emirates have. The seats are OK but the armrest is only on one side which I didn't like. The TV screens are big but the entertainment selection is quite poor. The service would be ok for business class but it's definitely not polished enough for first class. Again I don't want to compare them to their major competitors but Thai is miles behind. It just feels like it's not genuine it's very mechanical. About the food. I ordered a speciality meal thinking it would be better boy was I wrong! The white fish was inedible. I don't know what they did to it but it tasted like a shoe. I had to ask the flight attendant to give me salmon from the standard menu fortunately she had some left. It wasn't a culinary miracle by any means but at least I was able to eat it. Not sure what champagne they were serving but it wasn't good either. Now since this was only a 6 hour flight there were no PJs and it didn't seem like they had bedding for anyone either (at that point I didn't dare to ask just slept on the seat). Also we didn't receive the standard Rimowa first class amenity kit but rather a business class amenity kit designed by Porsche. So disappointing. The FA didn't make any attempt to apologize or explain that. I would definitely prefer to fly ANA business class NRT-BKK.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,Sydney to Bangkok. The entertainment package was great with plenty of choice the seats had lots of leg room which was a nice surprise for economy and I thought the food was good. Flight service over was better than the service on the way back where we were offered drinks quite often and the flight attendants were smiling and friendly. On the flight back service not quite as constant and a couple of the flight attendants were a bit surly. Also the seats were a bit worn and though I was just as comfortable my friend noticed the difference. However I would certainly recommend Thai Airways.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,2,no,4,Flew Thai on TG941 on the 11th of October 2014. From Milan to Bangkok on an aging 747. The plane had the hardest seats and the air conditioning wasn't able to cope with the afternoon sun. Cabin felt extremely stuffy and hot. The IFE wasn't working and we were told that they were restarting the system. After 2hrs into the flight it was apparent that the IFE was not going to work and for the next 11hrs or so all the passengers were restless. The cabin crew tried to make up for this by serving food and drinks regularly. Either way arrived at BKK with a sore back and with no sleep. Will never fly Thai ever again!
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,3,yes,8,26/9 Bangkok - Zurich LX181. 27/9 Zurich - Athens LX1830. 26/9 Perth - Bangkok TG484. Overall middle of the road airline. Business lounge [Qantas] in Perth mediocre. Business lounge in Bangkok poor considering it is the hub for Thai. Seat configuration could be better. Aircraft brand new Boeing 787 quiet and smooth.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,no,5,TG949 Madrid to Bangkok. On Oct 6th T Hawk submitted a complaint about the very poor seat he had in business class. Five days later on 11th Oct I had the same experience in seat 12J on the same flight from Madrid to Bangkok. When I tried to register a complaint in Bangkok a) at the ticket desk b) at the business class lounge they were simply not interested. The other 3 legs I travelled were good.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Shanghai - Chiang Mai - Bangkok and then Luang Prabang - Bangkok - Shanghai all in economy. Very comfortable great inflight entertainment very good service. Ordered vegetarian meal and this was confirmed and then delivered promptly. Really wonderful service and would definitely fly again.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,5,yes,8,The 777-300 that Thai uses for this 4 hour flight from Bali to Bangkok has a 2-3-2 configuration in business class with angled lie-flat seats which is excellent for this route. The IFE is somewhat outdated and doesn't have a huge selection of movies but personally I'm not into watching movies on shorter regional flights. Both the service and food were acceptable but not outstanding.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,1,no,4,TG949 MAD to BKK 777-200ER. There were no issues boarding the aircraft and every seat in the business cabin was occupied. The cabin interior on this 777 was worn out and the seats were very narrow and not at all comfortable. This aircraft should be retired from long haul routes or refurbished it is just not up to standard. The FA were friendly but the service was rushed and disorganized. The quality of food on Thai flights has been slipping but what they dished up this time hit a new low for me. Avoid this flight as you will not get much sleep due to the hard uncomfortable seats.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,2,no,2,TG-606 from Bangkok to Hong Kong. First time travelling Thai Airways and honestly I could not be more disappointed. At the beginning of the flight I reported that my entertainment screen was not working. They tried to solve the problem but after more than one hour they just gave up and asking me to switch seats. Luckily there were some spare seats but what would have happened if not? Awful service.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,no,3,"Business class flight from Phuket to Seoul on A330. Thai Airways staff at Phuket Airport business class check-in desk were awful. One agent told us our bag was ""illegal"" because it weighed too much. The Thai Airways Royal Silk lounge is an abomination. Ripped and soiled carpeting dishevelled and ageing furniture and broken lamps litter the small room. Only Singha beer offered amid decent food options. Onboard we had friendly and attentive cabin crew service but meals were very average. Angled ""lie flat"" seat was desperately uncomfortable for overnight 6.5 hour flight. It had horrible recline and was too small for a person of average height. Thai is drastically cutting costs and it shows."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Flights TG 614 and TG 615 Bangkok-Beijing. After 2 trips to Beijing in the so-called business class of Air China I decided to have a go at the Thai flight on the same route but in economy. Everything considered it is a far better option: choice of drinks decent food splendid entertainment system nice planes international reading material smiling attendants who offer a special service to gold card members by letting them have the first choice for the menus. All these features compensate the slightly wider seat of Air China to which you can add the better price too.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,I took TG621 to BKK last 18 Sep and TG620 back to MNL on 23 Sep. The B772 TG uses on the MNL-BKK route is well- maintained and therefore clean but its advanced age is evident. My friends and I liked the colorful seats and the 2-3-2 economy class seating at the rear of the aircraft which meant that the aisles in the tail section were never crowded. The entertainment which included Hitchcock and Hitchcock-inspired selections was great. The food on both legs were well-suited to the Filipino palette that requires the harmony of all types of tastes and flavors and the extra bread runs were obviously highly appreciated by most of the passengers who got seconds. I have flown with a few other airlines and what clearly sets THAI apart for me is the crew and how consistently warm and attentive they are throughout the flight regardless of the crew member you speak with. I wish TG would continue to leverage on their crew as their competitive advantage instead of their aircraft (the A380 and B787) that leave much to be desired at least in photos and collateral's.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Fly from Brussels to Bangkok with Thai Airways 777-300-ER. Everything went smoothly. I had 3 seats to myself so I could sleep a bit. Food tasted good and the staff really did there best to make it a pleasant journey. Good selection of audio/film. Price wise it's a excellent choice to fly with them.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew SYD-BKK economy return 2 adults and 2 children. No delays at check in seats comfortable with plenty of leg room for my 6ft + husband. Staff were pleasant drinks offered often and food was ok. I have had better meals on other airlines but my husband will argue that Thai's meals were delicious so I guess it's just personal preference. I was disappointed that my young son was not given an activity pack or anything at all! Every other airline we've flown with has offered books toys colouring in activities - something to keep the kids happy but Thai offered nothing to children at all. IFE was great. Plenty of movies or program's to keep both kids and adults happy. Would fly with Thai again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Osaka Kansai (KIX) to Bangkok brand new A330-300. Perfect service 2 delicious meals (on a 5.5 hour flight) free eye masks and toothbrushes second helping of bread for breakfast. BKK-HKT-BKK - Both sectors 777-300. Although the crew seemed in a rush due to the short flight time the lunch boxes were great! Services was good and everyone was so friendly. BKK- KIX - A380-800. Great clean aircraft and efficient service. Although it was a red eye flight crew went out of their way to make everyone feel comfortable. Crew constantly moved throughout the cabin with soft drinks and juices. Breakfast was an awesome Thai chicken dish served 1.5 hours before landing with second helpings of hot dinner rolls and croissants. Overall an excellent airline and always a pleasure to fly but the lounge at Kansai Airport needs serious improvement. Only instant noodles and rice balls available.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,Just flew Melbourne to Bangkok on the way to London business class. Had flight times changed so now sitting in Bangkok lounge for 7 hours. Seems that Thai have various planes with different seating and it seems a bit hit and miss as to whether you get lay flat bed type seat. We flew 777-300er and had flat beds. However very narrow and hard as a board. Staff pleasant as we boarded 11.30pm went straight to sleep so only had breakfast which was ok. They use Air New Zealand lounge along with Etihad in Melbourne fairly ordinary from food perspective. Thai Bangkok lounge better but again pretty boring in the food stakes. Would probably not use the flybuisnessforless tickets again as there seems to be no flexibility and now we fly to Dusseldorf and then on to London so you have to question if saving a $1000 is worth having flights changed with no comeback to over 35 hrs Melbourne - London travel time no points and not knowing if you are going to get flat bed seat. Old adage you get what you pay for I guess.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,AKL-BKK BKK-AKL. Best service we've experienced so far. Great value for money but also great service on return. Seats are spacious and comfortable. Passenger safety is very important for them. Intelligent cabin crew and friendly. We will always fly with this airline in the future. Pilot was great and professional. Thanks Thai Airways International for this great experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LHR-BKK-HKT 30th May 2014 TG 911 747. Flew with Thai Airways for the first time what a pleasant experience the plane was empty at the back so I had the opportunity to have a whole row to myself. The food was the best airline food I've had plenty of free drinks the crew couldn't do enough to help. The return journey was full but still had plenty of room I'm 63 and for once on my travels I've had legroom because of this I didn't hesitate in rebooking with Thai for my upcoming holiday.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,To those wanting inexpensive and smooth flights to Europe/Asia definitely try Thai. It was quality beyond expectation: indeed Smooth as Silk! Flew earlier this month from MEL-BKK and back again later. Kind courteous respectful service. Prompt answers to any requests. Yummy food. Excellent music in IES. Crew quite frequently asked if wanted more water help hot towels treating me like a VIP passenger! My request to upgrade to the spacious exit row seat was immediately granted in MEL. On leg back I was given bulkhead seat despite no requests from me I found the normal seat pitch comfortable enough. Most importantly both flights landed safely with few turbulence and at least 20 min before schedule. Best long-haul flight yet!
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,1,Beware row 43 on the airbus 340-600 unless you enjoy being seated 2ft from a toilet with all the associated noise of flushing banging doors and lights. This was our experience two days ago on a 12hr flight from Bangkok to Heathrow. Needless to say it really soured our annual family holiday. These seats really should not exist for long haul flights.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,I have flown Thai over the last 20 years and this is an airline with inconsistent service. Check in staff in Delhi and at times in Bangkok are rude. DEL-BKK-SYD still has a rather dated 744 on the BKK-SYD section. Food is good. Typical Thai fare (Jasmine Rice and Prawn curry with dessert). Staff are courteous and attentive. Inflight entertainment OK but nothing to crow about. The decor is nice like most things Thai very neat and organised. However like many airlines that are hard done cost cutting shows. Dated 744s on long range flights like BKK-SYD. The twice daily DEL-BKK service was a A330 and 777 now its a 777 and a Thai Smile A320 at a hideous hour. What came as a shock was the behaviour of the Check in Manager at Delhi Airport who was talking loudly on his mobile phone and barking instructions to passengers and staff alike. It was disgusting at first and laughable later. At times you will find middle aged women at check in counters in Bangkok who have a grim look pasted on their face. It definitely does not represent the land of smiles. A little more smile even faked will be welcome. However Thai offers competitive fares and for that reason alone I shall fly with them. I just hope Thai puts newer planes on the DEL-BKK-SYD leg like the 787 and the A380. I recommend Thai to those looking for a comfortable flight with no nasty surprises.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,SIN-BKK-SIN on the B777. On this route Thai have to compete with SQ and CX and showed a huge improvement compared to an earlier flight I took from the Philippines where they were only competing with PAL and Kuwait Airways. 9 across configuration with a good seat pitch but the box for the IFE does get in the way. Seat back screen was a decent size but the content was a bit of a letdown. Catering was very good for economy with the main course on a china dish metal cutlery and milk for tea and coffee compared with foil/plastic/creamer on some airlines. The baggage allowance in economy is only 20kg and needs increasing to 30kg in line with most of the competition. Overall I was perfectly happy with the price/service and will definitely use again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew Melbourne to Bangkok return. Staff are excellent and passengers are welcomed with a very respectful traditional Thai greeting once you step aboard the aircraft. Seats are comfortable with a good election of movies. We flew the night flight to Bangkok and a dinner and breakfast was served (whereas on the night flights with Malaysia Airlines only a light snack and breakfast is served). Cabin crew were excellent and there were numerous drinks round on both flights. My call button was answered promptly. Food served was good not exactly fine dining but more than adequate. Toilets very clean on both flights. I highly recommend Thai I have flown with many airlines and they rank as my favourite.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,6,HKG to BKK return. I have not traveled with Thai for over 5 years chose to fly with them due to the right pricing. The warm Thai hospitality remains but was let down by the food quality and quantity due to cost-cutting. Seats are comfortable enough especially on 747. On both legs the food served was small in quantity and the quality was below my expectation. Fried pork mince with sweet basil on rice looked like a 7-11 fast meal served on bone china dry and tasteless. Chicken red curry with rice tastes ok but quantity so small it's like children menu. Good if you are on diet but for any grown men that's way too small. I commented on that and FA was embarrassed but she agreed. The biz lounge and 30 min free massage was a saving grace. I don't mind flying with them but I wouldn't go out of my way to I still prefer my other choices such as Emirates and SriLankan which are cheaper and better.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,BKK-CNX v.v. on new 787. Outgoing Business Class return Economy class. Both flights are great. Aircraft's are needless to say spotless. The Dreamliner cabin make a journey enjoyable service excellent by professional crew with tasty light meal/ snack served. Business class seat leave a bit to be desired while Economy seat is above expectation. Problem with new TGs ticketing system affected my internet check-in did not get my preferred seat on both flights despite being the 4th and 2nd people to check in respectively. Other seats are block and cannot be assigned even at airport check in counter. The problem tarnished my otherwise excellent experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Economy seats on flights TG911 and TG910 a family of four. Great service on the Boeing 747 with good selection of films TV program's games and flight info via the seat back screens. Staff don't stop with free drinks meals and snacks. Flights in both directions provided a choice of two hot dinners and two breakfast options. Both routes left and arrived on time. Your Thai holiday starts just as soon as you board the plane. Quality of food was fine. Not fine dining as some would appear to require but certainly as good and tasty as any other airline that I have experienced.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,Sydney to BKK with unscheduled stop at Bali making the trip 4 hours more. I have had a gold card with Thai for about 20 years but I do not think I will keep it. This trip confirmed to me what people have been writing here. This 747 had old rock hard uncomfortable seats from 10 years ago the sound system was broken the menu has not altered for many years and BKK airport is too difficult for an older person. The arrogance of Thai to divert this flight thus making many passengers miss connecting flights or appointments without any prior notice is appalling when a plane could have been sent to Bali from BKK to take on some stranded Thai passengers from another flight without causing more problems.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,I flew business class with TG 920 by A380 from Bangkok to Frankfurt then LH to Chicago. Very good service onboard. Lounge is excellent compared to all American airlines. Impressive services provided by crews. Hope that Thai Airways will expand so there are more new A380 in other destinations.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,1,We've always thought Thai among the best international airlines but not this time! The Business Class lounge at BKK airport-their key location had the ambience of a Greyhound bus depot. Crowded uncomfortable with modest food offerings that were inedible. Flight TG 473 July 25 2014 BKK to Brisbane was awful. The so-called beds in the aircraft were not lie-flat and so uncomfortable that it was impossible to sleep. The food was poor and inedible- not even Economy standard. The flight attendants couldn't care less. So from now on it's Bye Bye Thai!
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,"BNE-BKK-LHR and CDG-BKK-BNE in Business Class. BNE-BKK in a 773 without ""lay flat"" seats but not an issue as this was a daytime flight. BKK-LHR in a refurbished 744 also without ""lay flat"" seats but I still managed to get 8hrs sleep. CDG-BKK in A380 and BKK-BNE in 773-ER both with ""lay flat"" seats. No complaints whatsoever about cabin crew food choice IFE or airport lounges especially as BNE and CDG are shared ""Star Alliance"" lounges. In fact wife was quite impressed with pleasant attitude of cabin crew especially when compared to JQ and QF(domestic). Fare included ""day use"" of a room at the Novotel at Suvharnabhumi as there was a 18hr stopover in BKK on return journey."
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5,yes,8,TG337 29th July. The plane was a big A330 but perhaps it was an old aircraft. There was no IFE! This is ridiculous in 2014. Before the flight took off I could only feel glad about the large amounts of leg room the old aircraft offered. I've not seen such a long leg room in any other Economy class flight. Pillows and blankets were fresh and I settled in. Since it was just a 3 hour night flight I preferred sleeping than watching movies. Hence the IFE's absence did not hurt me much. What impressed me was the extremely pleasant smiling and courteous service of the flight attendants. I had pre ordered a Hindu meal and what I got was excellent! There was chicken curry with rice and another vegetarian curry. The mango salad and the rice dessert were also perfect!
,,,First Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,BKK to LHR. Arrived fairly early and was whisked through check in security and escorted to the fab First class lounge in 10mins flat. Escorted to the plane and my seat. Very pleased to see the new First class semi suites which are very comfortable for sitting and sleeping. Service prompt and food quickly served to maximise sleep. Arrived on time and despite a busy T3 bags delivered quickly.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,yes,10,BKK-JNB TG991. JNB-BKK TG992. The service was very good but they need to improve the inflight entertainment - they are very slow on Boeing 747-200ER. Thai Foods is good and water or juice is served every 30 minutes. The economy seats are not very comfortable but the ticket was a reasonable rate.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,After flying with many airlines I decided to use Thai as it offered a direct flight from Melbourne to Bangkok. Business crew were not helpful and looked like they were enduring their jobs and taking out their frustrations on the passengers. I found them to be rude arrogant and unhelpful when I asked for assistance with my cabin luggage due to a back injury I was told I had to put it under a seat. When I explained that I was unable to bend to do this my case was unceremoniously shoved in by a senior crew member. Their controlling manner and inflexible routines made the trip a relief to be finished. The food was not worth eating - rubbery scrambled eggs and dry tough salmon. I will never fly with Thai again. I have had much better experiences in Economy with other airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,CPH-BKK-CPH Very nice and comfortable airplanes 777s. Thai has really improved their product when replacing the old 747´s. Entertainment system good with a wide variety of movies TV-series etc. Staff very friendly and attentive food great as always. Last couple of trips to BKK I have chosen different airlines due to the former outdated 747 but from now on I will definitely fly Thai again. The flights were on time both ways.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LHR-BKK-KUL TG911/TG415 had to travel from London to Kuala Lumpur at very short notice on Saturday 5th July. Thai was one of the only airlines available to book online apart from the check in at LHR T3 being shambolic the flights where great. On the LHR-BKK flight 747-400 the seats were very good with plenty of room the food some of the best I've had in economy the crew were just the best very helpful. I was taking my niece back to KL after a family bereavement the crew so caring. I had access to the Thai lounge in BKK which offered a relaxing place to wait for the connecting flight the flight BKK-KUL another great crew new aircraft nice seating and great food I don't use Star Alliance much these days but will consider returning my loyalty after this experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew LHR-Bangkok on 24 May (A340-600 barely 30% occupied) Bangkok - Chiang Mai 28 May (one hour flight on an A330 barely 50% occupied) and Bangkok - LHR on 7/8th June (B747 90% occupied). All flights on time decent leg room and reasonable choice of movies on long haul. Food served free on domestic. Though all food was average at best. Very helpful friendly and pleasant staff throughout. My only complaint is the slowness of boarding - for every staff member checking boarding cards there seemed to be at least one more standing watching rather than helping.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,Was flying HKG-BKK on 22nd June. Departure on time Service was ok. Food nothing to write home about. Pretty standard would like to see a bit more valued dishes in BC class. A Thai style chicken which consisted of a tasteless fried chicken leg served with steamed rice and Japanese Eggs. Fruit should be ripe. Otherwise flight was pleasant.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,Flew SYD to BKK Wed 11th June TG 146. What a total disappointment. An hour late to leave. IFE did not work. 8.5 hours of flying with no music to listen to no TV/ movies. Cabin crew completely indifferent. Probably experienced it many times. Food was rubbish hot curies for breakfast and whatever the next meal was supposed to be. Overheated inedible noodle dish. Couldn't wait to get off.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew from Frankfurt to Bangkok First Class A340-600. Service was Royal First as they claim food was excellent as well as seat comfort. Thai Airways represents for me the Spirit of Thai people first class on service friendly and humble.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Frankfurt to BKK on flight TG921 on May 6th returning on May 16th. Service was great flight crew helpful and always had a smile. Inflight entertainment and food second to none. Will not hesitate to use again.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,3,yes,5,My hubby and I have been flying to Thailand each year for the last ten years we decided to shout ourselves an upgrade to business class as it was our ten year anniversary when you check your baggage in you ask how much to upgrade and we got a good deal having always been in economy one thing that really annoyed me was we only like flying during the day and unfortunately on Thai Airways day or night after they serve you food they shut all the shades down and expect you to sleep (this is obviously a ploy to stop asking the crew for drinks etc). However myself and a couple of other people keep our shades open even though the crew always try and shut them to my horror on business class the same thing happened shades went down. If I'm flying business it's my option if I want my shade down or not very annoying.. Anyway I just kept my shade open much to their annoyance apart from that service was good food bit average for business class would be very interested to know if other airlines do the same thing shutting all the shades?
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,TG492 AKL to BKK economy class. Although plane half full due to political unrest in Thailand the service was outstanding and of same standard as 6 months ago.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,TPE-BKK rt in Business. No complaints start to finish. Both flights pretty full despite a political situation in Thailand that is supposedly having a negative impact on the travel industry. Food on Thai is better than the Taiwan airlines flying this route.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,3,no,3,Our flight was SYD-LHR return via BKK seats 14A & B in all sectors below are the relevant points. SYD-BKK (744) - the sound on the audio and video channels for both seats continually broke up rendering system useless out of 2 wines only 1 available. BKK-LHR (744) - again the sound and audio for both seats continually broke up and again unable to use IFE out of the same 2 wines on offer only the same wine on the first leg was available. LHR-BKK (A340-600) - As on the previous 2 sectors the same white wine was not available from the same list. BKK-SYD (744) - I bought a book as we were again flying a 744 unfortunately my overhead light would not switch on and just to add to the farce my wife's overhead light would not go off on a positive note the IFE was working. After our dinner I asked for a second coffee only to be told by an extremely arrogant cabin crew member that I had not finished my first one yet this is not in any sense hospitality this is just being down right rude. My wife and I have been travelling with Thai for 20 years (I can hear you saying 'more fool us') but no more.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Our trip to Thailand was almost spoilt before it even started. An easy check in at Melbourne Airport and then down to the Lounge. The lounge was like a dungeon. Late on a Friday night the food was terrible. A soup of some sort that I did not like the look of and packet fish fingers and soggy potato wedges. The fish was inedible. Grey and mushy in texture. In their defence the staff offered to make us a sandwich. A sandwich in the business lounge? The bar was well stocked and we survived until we boarded the plane. The plane an almost new 777. The flight meals and cabin crew were all excellent. At all our other stops the lounges were excellent with fresh food available. Melbourne lounge very disappointing.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,LAX-BKK-AKL. Business. New Star Alliance lounge at LAX was excellent feeling more like a five star hotel with outdoor patio. Overall Thai was flawless on both legs with excellent service that was attentive and professional. The cabin is clean and smart with angle lie flat seats with great pillows and duvets. Order the Chef was a great choice with the lobster as with all meals and excellent selection of wines. Was very impressed how this felt very Thai and authentic. Sleeping was not a problem and quite comfortable. The highlight is the BKK Thai lounge - there are three and the one I preferred had the standard fixtures with great private bedrooms to catch some sleep. Also a free massage at there spa which I had to say was one of the best I've had. I would fly Thai again for sure.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,4,BRU-BKK-BRU in May 2014. I had a very nice crew on both flights food was great for airplane food. The seats enabled me to sleep in comfortable way most of the flights. The onboard entertainment system was very good with lots of new films.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,2,BKK-LHR TG 910 07/08/2013. Miserable rude check in staff and then to find the gate boarding staff even worse. No Thai smiles on this trip. Cabin crew were better but not as attentive as other options on the LHR route. The ground staff got the journey off to a bad start which coloured the whole journey!
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,1,Sat on TG911 (London to Bangkok) for 4 hours on the tarmac before this flight was cancelled due to engine failure. Staff seemed to be out of their depth. Eventually put on another star alliance flight to Bangkok which was a cheaper flight than the one we had paid for. When checking in for return to London Thai Airways had given our seats away. After a lot of haggling got onto flight. Shocking service. Staff poorly trained but worse were rude and arrogant. They tried to get us to accept an economy flight when we had paid for business. I will never fly this airline again.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,"TG911 LHR-BKK 747-400 Royal First Class - new first class cabin. Managed to get online check in completed 23 hours before the flight and got seats 1A and 1K. Because we were transiting through Bangkok and onto Hanoi we had to get our boarding passes at LHR as our visas had to be checked. Arrived at the Royal First class desk where we were processed in an efficient and friendly manner. When flying Thai Airways Royal First Class you are told that you can use the SAS London Lounge which is the general Star Alliance lounge in T3. In fact you are also able to use the Singapore Airlines First Class lounge which if you time it right with their flights is actually a much nicer lounge and much quieter. There are no announcements in the lounge so you have to be a bit vigilant with the time for boarding especially if your gate is a walk away. Arrived at the gate just as boarding had started and after a short wait first and business class passengers were ushered down a separate boarding way into door 1L. Within a matter of minutes the cabin service director came and welcomed us on board he came round with a tray of glasses and a bottle of champagne in hand. The ambience of the new first class cabin is noticeable with its hues of cream purple and wood. The mini suites (without doors) are spacious the seats wide and comfortable and comes with plenty of storage space to the side under the windows and under the ottoman. To the front sits the massive 23"" screen with the ubiquitous Thai orchid in pride of place and on the aisle side is a small closet with hanging space. To the window side of the seat starting at the front is the magazine rack storage for the headphones and a multi pin power socket then the large and heavy wooden table which lifts out of the housing followed by a small touch screen which controls the seat positions and then a further storage area where the entertainment handset 2 x USB ports and a further cubby hole can be found. For couples travelling together seats 1A and 1K are definitely the ones to go for if you want a window view otherwise seats 3E and 3F which are two seated together in the middle at the rear of the cabin. If you are travelling alone any of the other widow seats or 2E will be suitable. There was very little communication from the flight deck throughout the flight but it kept the flight quiet and peaceful. The food service was exceptional and started almost immediately. First came the drinks service and warm nuts. Drinks service was followed by canapés. Once this was finished the table was laid and service began. We had pre-ordered the Lobster Thermidor online and it did not disappoint. Once I had finished watching a film I asked the crew to make up my bed and by the time I returned to my seat my bed was made. I slept for about 4-5 hours before the lights were switched on for the breakfast service. Before we started to make our descent into Bangkok the first class crew came round to each individual passenger to thank them for flying with Thai and handed out an orchid a lovely touch. This particular crew were friendly chatty and attentive without being annoying. The food and drink service was exceptional and the pre-ordered dish was very good. The new cabin is comfortable airy and the mini suites cocoon you from your fellow passengers; I like the relaxed feel of the cabin with only 9 seats compared to British Airways first cabin of 14."
,,,First Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,2,no,4,TG916 BKK-LHR A340-600 Royal First Class. I checked in online 24 hours before the flight and was able to confirm seats 1A and 2A which I had already allocated beforehand. Because we were transiting through Bangkok from Koh Samui we had to get our boarding passes at BKK. Arrived at the Royal First class area and were greeted by two eager porters who took our bags and another member of staff took our passports. We were ushered to the seating area whilst the formalities of check in was completed. We were then ushered off through fast track security and then onto fast track immigration which again was swift. After immigration you descend an escalator which takes you straight into the Royal Silk Business Class lounge however as we were flying First Class a golf buggy was awaiting us at the bottom and we were whisked off through the business class lounge and along the corridor of Concourse D to the Royal Orchid Spa. As we had booked a massage at the check in desk we were dropped off outside the spa. There are no calls for boarding in the lounge instead lounge staff come and find you 20 minutes before the flight is due to depart and escort you to the aircraft. Boarding was swift and straight-forward. Shortly after taking my seat a glass of champagne was offered along with papers magazines and the menu. Aircraft servicing the lunchtime departure to the UK is the A340-600 and so the Royal First Class is of the older open seat variety. The cabin does feel very spacious with only 8 seats but it is an old layout. There is plenty of storage although not as many sockets and connection points and cubby hole cupboards as on the new 747 layout. For couples travelling together the middle seats 1/2E and 1/2F are definitely the ones to go for however if you want a window view you can sit in tandem as we did and have either 1/2A or 1/2K and dine together if you fancy a chat. Flight pushed back on time the food service started well with the drinks service and warm nuts and the canapés. The crew did not come around and ask for our meal order instead choosing to serve everyone in the cabin the same early courses and then proceeded to offer the main courses from the wheeled table. They completed missed out one of the main course choices. By the time we were served the food was cold and unappetising. Even though this was a daytime flight I wanted to try to get some sleep so proceeded to make my bed at which point one of the crew came out of the galley and continued the process for me. The seat on the old A340-600 does not go fully flat it leaves the head end slightly elevated which quite frankly was causing me some severe problems with my neck when lying on my side I probably only got 2-3 hours sleep. Lights were switched on 2 hours before landing and the afternoon meal was served. I opted for the Chicken and Leek soup which because it was served to order was hot and delicious. We landed on time and bags were collected within about 30 minutes of landing. The Thai Airways ground service at Bangkok was absolutely second-to-none from the moment we checked in we were very well looked after the flight however left a lot to be desired and was shame considering the excellent service we had on the outbound flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flight TG 911 and return TG 910 LHR - Bangkok and return was fantastic. The inflight entertainment was very good. Food was quite acceptable and the service of the flight attendants very good indeed. The Boeing 747-400 which has been refurbished was comfortable with good leg room and just purred along. Flight on time each way. My wife and I flew with Thai on 3rd April 2014.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,TG911 6 April 2014. Great flight as the inflight entertainment was great and the food was actually quite nice and the staff were always bright and ready for any occasion. No complaints.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,HKG-BKK-HKG Outbound flight TG639 Inbound flight TG602 both A330-300. Outbound was slightly delayed due to traffic congestion at Hong Kong airport (travel at the peak of Easter holiday). Staff services were great for both flights friendly efficient and smooth. Dinners were quite delicious. Inflight Entertainment of the inbound flight was very disappointing. There was no TV screen for each seat.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,,,1,no,5,BKK-CDG-BKK A380 seat 77j Economy. Not a bad flight but very limited space for tall people like me. Food ok wine served in plastic bottle is terrible. Flight attendants looked tired and bored. Forgot something in the plane on arrival of course they didn't find anything and we were the last to leave the aircraft.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,1,no,3,We went from Sydney to Bangkok then Bangkok to Phuket and return. Food was just passable. Service really needs work. Pressed the attendant buzzer and was walked past a number of times. Not even asked if we would like wine with our dinner and were squashed in I doubt I would use this airline again. The only good thing were that the flights were on time.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,5,BRU-BKK on B777-200 and BKK-FRA on AB346. Seats on both planes are the semi lie flat type most of the other Asian carriers exchanged in favour of full lie flat seats. I don't understand why TG can't have fully lie flat seating on near 12 hour flights. It is difficult to sleep in the current seats. IFE was somewhat slow but there was a decent inventory of films. A nice touch was the loaded menu for the flight as I didn't get a menu on my return flight. Outgoing flight service was somewhat poor with the FAs not too interested in the pax. Return flight had FAs present in the cabin. On both flights despite there supposedly being a selection of white wines there was one white wine option only. Outgoing 1st meal was overcooked bland and poorly presented. The 2nd meal was equally unpleasant. Return flight 1st meal was up to TG's former reputation but the 2nd meal option consisted of some greasy pork sausages on cabbage with boiled potato. It looked like someone had run down to the 7-11 and bought some of those hot dogs that are a mainstay of Thailand 7-11s. Seriously sausages as a meal in business class? The other option was duck. Gate staff in Brussels are contracted out and they were rather unpleasant. Bangkok TG check-in and gate experience was excellent. Baggage service on inbound flight was slow and rather poor However bags were delivered promptly in FRA. It's sad to see an airline that had once set the standard for service and F&B deteriorate. I hope that TG can set itself straight.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,TPE-BKK and return. Both flights on time and up to expectations for TG. The A333 seats are not flat but for the time enroute that was unnecessary. I do like Thai's service and the quiet efficiency of the crew. Overall another pleasant experience and the availability of the spa and a massage on departure makes it even more desirable.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,BKK-HKT-PKK in Economy Class. Was thoroughly pleased with the Thai Airways flight. Not only the service punctuality and price but also the treatment of Star Gold. Even though it's a relatively short flight (1 hour and change) both segments operated with widebody (A330/777-300) and made for a really pleasant journey. Offered exit row seats without having to ask - which was wonderful. Great snack run and multiple coffee/water runs done during the flight. The cabin crew couldn't have been more hospitable. First time on Thai and would recommend to friends/family. All in all a great experience from check-in to security to lounge access to baggage handling/arrival.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,"We flew TG106 on 03/04/14 on BKK-CNX route and returned on 05/04/14 by TG111 using redemption tickets. We originally were confirmed on an earlier TG104 but that flight was cancelled and we were placed on TG106. We were informed on this cancellation two days prior to the travelling date. BTW on the morning of 03/04/14 we were again rung if we could be moved to other flights and the answer was absolutely ""no"". This cancellation approach does not give us good impression. To be fair inflight services are OK and reasonable on both legs. Yet the TG104 used an old B737-400 with old uncomfortable seats whilst the return was an A330 with modernised seats and more leg rooms."
,,,First Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,2,no,1,SYD-BKK in First Class. Thai Airways managed to stuff up my complete itinerary just days before my departure. The flight was cancelled without notification. No calls. No emails. Nothing. I was eventually put back on the original flight. The cabin looked worn out the flight attendant didn't look motivated at all and the food quality was extremely poor. Overall it was a sad and disappointing experience especially for First Class. I will avoid Thai Airways in the future.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Denpasar to Bangkok return TG 432 and TG 431. Outward on an Airbus and back on B777. Both flights nearly full but the crew worked hard on both legs. Big difference for this trip was the personal TV screens compared to nothing 12 months ago. Preferred the B777 cabin layout.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,"Last night I enjoyed a wonderful flight from BKK to SIN (flight 409) in business class. FA's were efficient and professional. I ate in the lounge prior to the flight so I didn't intend to eat again but the food was very good. The seats were extremely comfortable and the IFE was varied and responsive. Add to that the ""smooth as silk"" flight and I was a happy camper!"
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,1,no,1,Having booked business class we expected to be seated in business class seats. Our flight was from Melbourne to Bangkok and return so we at least expected to fly in a 777-300. However they apparently only use the old 777-200 which is pathetic. The seats are uncomfortable even to sit in and more impossible to sleep in.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Flight TG 640 on 14/03/16 A380. Staff were very friendly. A slow service for serving the ordered menu when you call the staff the response was not quick. The Seats are very uncomfortable the seat is too high. For me with a height of 171 cms I can't have my feet comfortably on floor. Even when the seat was in a flat position (near flat 170 degrees) the leg space is very small. The entertainment system is of the newest standards with big and clear touch screens.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,4,"BKK-LHR. After an exceptionally good outward flight I found myself at the very back of the economy cabin for the return trip. This seat was narrower than standard had an entertainment box under the seat in front and had far less seat pitch than the advertised 34"". In short it was very cramped. Another problem was that every time we flew through any slightly unstable air the back of the plane yawed from side to side sufficiently to spill drinks. I imagine this is because the A340-600 is so long and the back seats are a long way from the centre of pressure so any slight lateral movement is exaggerated. After 13 hours of this I felt most unwell. The cabin crew were as good as before."
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Bangkok to Phuket. Boeing 747. No problem at check in. Delicious food and variety of beverages. Plane took off and landed on time. The window seat was just fine lie flat seats and plenty of space. Inflight entertainment was good but a little difficult to use. Loved the flight and would fly on Thai again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,"LHR-BKK. This was the best economy class flight I have had in 45 years of travelling. Although I am 6ft 2"" I had ample leg room. The food was good the cabin crew excellent the toilets were kept spotless and sandwiches and drinks were always available in the rear galley. I cannot think of a single thing to complain about. The return flight however was rather different."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,4,"BKK-LHR. After an exceptionally good outward flight I found myself at the very back of the economy cabin for the return trip. This seat was narrower than standard had an entertainment box under the seat in front and had far less seat pitch than the advertised 34"". In short it was very cramped. Another problem was that every time we flew through any slightly unstable air the back of the plane yawed from side to side sufficiently to spill drinks. I imagine this is because the A340-600 is so long and the back seats are a long way from the centre of pressure so any slight lateral movement is exaggerated. After 13 hours of this I felt most unwell. The cabin crew were as good as before."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Heathrow to Bangkok in March 2014 then connected to Phuket. Seamless transfers luggage transferred from flight to flight no problems or work from us. We traveled economy and felt we had reasonable leg space the inflight entertainment was very good. The staff could not have been nicer they were polite helpful and attentive on all four flights. If you needed another drink or snack you just needs to ask.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,2,no,3,CDG-BKK TG931 and BKK-CDG on A380. New Planes. Clean and Airy cabin. Lie Flat seats OK but narrow. IFE good. Staff efficient but robotic. Main Meal Lunch outbound rushed and Dinner inbound again rushed. Pre Meal Drinks served with one tiny bag of peanuts and on return served with nothing at all! Quality of food served on board between mediocre and poor. Overall an inferior business class experience. Both flights perfectly on time.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew on a 777-300 with recently refurbished business class. Seating wasn't bad. Bed was lie flat but not too wide. Wine list selection was a little thin and only serve French wines. Food was not bad but not the best I've had. Not quite as good as SQ but overall it was decent value for money.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,SIN-BKK-ZRH-BKK-SIN in March 2014. 1st leg and BKK to ZRH were good with a 2 hour connection. Return ZRH to BKK was sub par as service on board was patchy and forgetful. Food OK. Had a 5 hour lay over in BKK due to flights reduction due to troubles in Bangkok. Had arrive around 6.45 am and flight out was at 12.20pm. Had decided despite this to fly Thai as they were almost 50% cheaper on J Class than SQ and 40% cheaper than Qatar my usual airline. For this price I am not going to complain!
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Bangkok - Kathmandu - Bangkok. A comfortable flight food and wine were OK without being top notch service was friendly and unobtrusive. Seats were comfortable and allowed a good rest. They were angled flat seats. Flight was long enough to allow a movie to be watched in each direction. No problems with check ins and bags received priority in both directions.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,yes,8,BKK-CPH. Had to use business class / Royal Silk) options as economy class full for days. Used fast track and got to lounge which was crowded but with much better food solutions than I have seen in any other airport. Flight at night on 777-300ER. Dinner quickly served cold options absolutely the best as hot meals seemed somewhat overcooked of 4 options I took prawns with garlic coriander sauce which was rather tasteless and unspicy with rice - not too interesting all in all like an enlarged economy meal - also breakfast options. However service both effective smiling and very quick leaving a long night for sleep on fully flat bed. Inflight entertainment average and compared to e.g. emirates and Turkish with less - to me - interesting options although most of night spend sleeping.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,2,no,3,I had the most unpleasant night flight from Bangkok to Copenhagen. Seats are so uncomfortable it is impossible to get more than an hours sleep. Food is really horrible. Service is nothing like you would expect from Thai people who are usually always so nice and kind and service minded. I asked for vegetarian food I was not able to book it previously and the hostess came with ham and salami. I don't think I will try Thai Airways again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,,,4,yes,6,OSL-BKK-AKL-BKK-OSL: Oslo legs on new B773s while Auckland legs on older B772s. Screens much better on the newer planes. Seat comfort good on all. IFE was excellent with plenty of movies to choose from. However I was very disappointed with the service and food on all legs. Half the crew seemed grumpy the whole time and not a smile was to be seen. Two very bland meals were served on each leg. We got hungry mid-flight on several of the legs and asked if they had any snacks but all they could offer was some crackers and cheese. Crew were not particularly diligent in going round with water/drinks during the flights so most of the time I ended up going to the galley myself. Overall a disappointment. Have experienced a lot better on some of the other Asian (and even European) carriers.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flight from Bangkok to Frankfurt and back on the new A380. Excellent comfort excellent service everything ran smooth as a clockwork both ways. I found the cabin crew to be more attentive than usual and they were paying excellent attention to the elderly couple sitting in front of me.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,3,Thai Smile BKK-MFM. No smiles on this flight zero entertainment revolting food nothing for kids. Pretty much the same level as service as NokAir except at TG prices. Check in at BKK is for all Thai Smile flights international and domestic so be prepared for a long queue. Glad we didn't opt for business class which are the same economy seats with the center one left empty! Flight was on time though.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,2,no,3,BKK-AKL-BKK. No flat bed in business class very uncomfortable seat food was as good as economy class food on regular airlines - doesn't match business class and price offered. Very little service with uninterested staff. Only good point is its a direct fly. Very disappointed overall.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,2,yes,5,LHR-BKK (747)-HKG (777)-BKK(747)-LHR(A340) I had forsaken my 2 favoured carriers to BKK adjusted my trip and paid a higher than needed fare to do two flights on the A380. I was not best pleased when as soon as trip finalised they were taken off (LHR-BKK and HKG-BKK). Overall OK-a trailing rather than leading product except for BKK-LHR which was wonderful in all aspects. Generally I don't mind the semi lie flat seats but just could not a get comfortable adjustment on any except the A340 this flight was 'smooth as silk' with a great crew and product whereas the rest was going through the motions more. Lounges OK at best-very good at HKG. Fast track at LHR and departure at BKK only-immigration took 1.5 hrs going into Thailand and nearly an hour at HKG due to obscure pax in my line. Overall probably would have put a X instead of a tick but the BKK/LHR was so good all round has lifted the experience but will be reverting to my usual carriers in future.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,Thai Smiles is not much of a smile! On domestic routes a large number of flights (but not all) are now done under the name Thai Smiles. If TG is an airline I have always appreciated and flown both internationally and domestically their Thai Smiles at least in Business class is just a way to cheat passengers: if you buy a ticket on TG you don't expect to be on a flight offering a low cost airline service at a normal airline business cost. On this flight Bangkok to Krabi we were sitting in coach seats (no passenger in the middle that is the only plus) food was revolting and service to its minimum. To be honest a few days later I flew another domestic TG from Chiang Mai to BKK this time with business seats and service. So be sure to check if your flight will be Smiles or not!
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,7,Singapore to Sapporo via Bangkok and return from Haneda to Singapore via Bangkok again. All flights were in Business class except Haneda - Bangkok which was in First. 1st sector SIN-BKK 777-300ER comfortable seats but a bit on the narrow side and claustrophobic when in the fully flat mode. Staggered seating so everybody had aisle access. Service and food was fantastic. Crew were friendly and energetic. Towels newspapers and drinks offered on ground. BKK-CTS 777-300 seats arranged 2-3-2 in angled flat. Still comfortable and I find more spacious than the 777-300ER seats. However service was terrible. Could see the crew was just going through the motion and didn't bother. The 2 stewards had no smiles. On ground no towels or newspaper offered only drinks. After takeoff a light refreshment is served and breakfast before arrival. Didn't eat so cant comment on the food. Haneda-Bangkok in First 747-400. Night flight so not much to comment. Everything offered on ground. Rimowa toiletry kit which was nice. One thing about Thai their blankets are really very nice and comfy. The supervisor offered to make my bed but as it was already in flat bed mode I told her it was ok. Again light refreshment served after takeoff and breakfast served before landing. Didn't eat again but my friend had the eggs and he said it was awful. TG changed our seats before we left for Sapporo from 2 windows to the 2 center seats. Their reason - change of aircraft. Transit in Bangkok was fantastic. They had a buggy waiting to transport us to the lounge. As our original flight to Singapore was cancelled we had a 7 hour layover. They let us use the First Class lounge so we could take a nap in one of their private rooms. Lounge was empty so was very peaceful and quiet. BKK-SIN A330 again service was very good on this short hop. Crew were young and enthusiastic and food very good. Would fly Thai again for its reasonable ticket and comfortable seats.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,LHR-BKK TG 917 out on 13th Feb 2014 back BKK to LHR on 23rd Feb Airbus A340. I have not flown Thai since 1994 but was extremely impressed with the standard. The crew were superb nothing was too difficult for them plenty of food and drink served in generous quantities even in economy. AVOD a bit slow to respond but a decent selection of films and music available. I will definitely use them again. I am 6 ft tall and I was impressed with the space for my legs.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew from London to Bangkok in December 2013. Flight departed on time. We have previously flown with another Airline to Bangkok but chose Thai due to the excellent price! We were slightly worried as it was a good deal. All our worries disappeared once we were on the airline. The seats were great with much more leg room than the other Airlines we have flown with. We were offered a drink quickly and offered drinks continually through our flight. Food excellent and served quickly and tasted really great. The staff were fantastic always smiling happy to help. The on board entertainment was also very good lots of film choices. Would definitely fly with Thai again and would highly recommend.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,4,TG601 HKG-BKK 7474-400 Seat 69A. I've not used Thai for a few years since changing the alliance I use from Star to Oneworld this however was the cheapest I could find on this route. I can't remember ever using TG in economy either it's always been business and on a few occasions first for what I paid it was ok seat was not that comfortable although there was enough space. They served a hot meal which was fine and the aircraft despite being very old had PTV in all seats my star alliance membership ends soon but I managed to use the lounge at HKIA food was good with lots of variety and it's located very close to the departure gate. All in all an ok trip and service for a 2hr 30min flight I don't know if I would use TG in economy for a long haul I like the premium economy offered by most Oneworld carriers.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,,3,no,3,TG507 Bangkok to Muscat on February 23. Flight was only half full. A330-300 appeared very old. Entertainment system did not work at all. Crew did their best with good service. Food was not very good though.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Phuket-Hong Kong in Business class. For a regional business class - this was very good indeed. The aircraft an Airbus 300 wide bodied was about 3 years old. The interior was immaculate. The seats although not fully flat on the recline was very comfortable indeed for the 4 hour flight. Good AVOD entertainment system. Drinks all served from a trolley was a nice touch. Food very tasty and good portions. FAs very friendly and efficient. All in all - good value for money and I would strongly recommend.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,My wife and I flew Bangkok - Sapporo - Bangkok TG670 8 Feb TG671 16 Feb. Both flights were B777-300ER. Check In was efficient in Bangkok and excellent in Sapporo. Cabin crew were friendly and gracious. Our special meal requests were handled without problems.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,KIX-BKK-MEL in Business Class. Overnight to BKK in A330 - these J seats look the same as the 777/747 J seats but have less pitch therefore are on more of an angle. Despite the light load I found sleeping difficult as it was a tight angle. BKK is an enormous airport and take a long time to walk anywhere. TG Lounges were fine - was hoping for the chicken noodle soup I enjoyed there last time but it was not to be. Boarded at a remote gate which was a complete shambles and thus departed late. BKK-MEL was on the 777-200 which is a fantastic cabin - very spacious more pitch than the A330 therefore a flatter bed. Was very surprised and impressed to be served both a full breakfast and a full dinner - usually on Asian to Australia flights you get one of the other + a snack. 'Signature dish' of Massaman Curry was dreadful - chicken in red water but there's always plenty of food on Thai. Thai is a very old fashioned airline and not in the same league as CX and SQ but have a perfectly acceptable business class product.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,3,yes,3,Auckland-Bangkok 8/1/14-30/1/14 TG491 and 492. Boeing 777-200 was good. Food was average movies etc were good. Cabin crew were uninterested. Overall okay.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,2,no,5,LHR to BKK Flight TG911 on 6th January was satisfactory with friendly obliging staff although requested seats were found not to have been confirmed when we checked in and therefore had to settle for alternative! Frequent offers of drinks during the flight. Spent time at BKK reserving seats for return which were confirmed in print and on web. Booking in for return on Flight TG 910 on 26th January to find we had been allocated seats by bulkhead and toilets! Not happy and sleepless night! Staff were off hand and rushed meals so much they bore little resemblance to the menu. No drinks were offered during the night.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew on 15 January 2014 from BKK to CDG via TG 930 in business class. New A380: Beautiful aircraft most comfortable business class. As I was not hungry at dinner time I advised the cabin attendant that I would skip the dinner but would like a snack later. Around mid-point in the flight I went to the galley and asked the attendant for some food. I was told that no food would be available until the breakfast service several hours later. I was given only two small packets of crackers to last several hours until the next full meal service causing me several hours of discomfort. Unbelievable! Other than that the flight was great.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,2,yes,6,TG 639 from HKG to BKK. Overall was ok but the choice of food is less interesting. Crew were friendly. The big let down was the wait for the luggage to arrive. The bags of business class came after the economy bags and the wait was about 40 mins. No staff were there to address any inquires I had.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Perth-Bangkok-Sapporo. My expectations were bad however I was extremely pleased. The cabins were clean and there was plenty of leg room. On one flight I even got a row of 4 to myself. The food was fantastic. Excellent entertainment and above all excellent service.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Traveled BKK-CMB-BKK Business Class on Thai Smile it was like traveling in a shoe box. The most uncomfortable airline I have ever traveled for a 3.5 flight which felt like 6 hours. The stewardesses did their best but the seats were absolutely unacceptable for business class. There were not enough overhead space for the luggage whereby we had to store our luggage in the empty seat between the seats in Business class. Never again Thai Smile. If anyone is ever intending to travel on Thai Smile be prepared for the worst.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,5,Inconsistent service! We travelled outbound London to Bangkok business class on TG911 on 15th January 2014. Throughout the flight the service was second to none and we had thought Thai had really upped their game. The staff were superb the inflight meal service extremely well presented and of a good standard. The entertainment reasonable. Sadly the return journey in business class TG 910 on 28/29 January 2014 fell so very far short of satisfactory. The staff were surly and obviously didn't want to be there and not particularly helpful. The drinks and meal service was shocking! The staff were on a mission to 'throw' everything at the passengers as soon as possible so they had nothing to do from there on! The drinks and meal service was completed within less than an hour of take off before we had chance to have a drink our meal was virtually thrown at us and cleared before completion. Similarly the breakfast service was faster than McDonalds and the meal dry and inedible (scrambled egg which had solidified) the whole return journey felt unwelcoming and one I would not wish to experience again especially given the premium pricing! Hence sadly reducing my overall rating of this airline from what could have been substantially higher if based on the outward journey only!
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,All in all not a bad experience at all. The Business Class lounge at Suvarnabhumi Airport (Concourse E) was nice and clean couches were comfortable and there was a reasonable variety of food to eat. Only criticisms are that there should have been more types of fruit to choose from. Our Boeing 777-300 seats in business class had a very generous amount of leg room. The seats do not recline completely flat but I was comfortable enough to be able to get to sleep. Earplugs and blindfolds were also provided which gave me a more peaceful rest. Generally cabin crew were friendly especially when you talk to them personally. They could have smiled at bit more however in other situations such as when they are serving food and beverages. Special mention to the fresh fruits that I had for breakfast which had amazing presentation on the plate! Overall pretty positive experience just a few little things that TG should look at to enhance the experience for customers.
,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,4,yes,5,Flew Thai flight 910 from Bangkok to Heathrow on 1/13/14. The flight arrived 20 minutes late which cut into our 90 minute time to reach our connecting flight. There was no onboard announcements about connecting flights no one to answer questions once we deplaned. Since this was our first time in Heathrow we did not know that everyone has to go to a connecting flight area of the terminal. We were left wondering if we would find our connecting carrier until we found some security personnel to ask. On this return flight as well as on the flight over gone were the slippers gone were the eyeshades gone were the little bottles of water gone were the toothbrushes and amenities in the lavatories. The food was worse than in years past. In short Thai Airways is becoming more like the horrible American domestic carriers and losing its Asian charm.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,SIN-BKK. Excellent award trip excellent cabin on a Boeing 777-300 with really big staggering columned seats providing a perfect degree of privacy and socializing. Aircraft new. Smart chairs nice colours and decorations. Staff very caring and tried to please me in all ways. 3 hot meals offered which is enough for a 2 hours flight. Champagne and wines good – all 5 products offered comes from France only. This has been the limitation for Thai for years. Good teas and 3 kind of beers offered. Staff really care for the business class passengers.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,LHR to BKK 747-400R 1k & 2k 21/12/2014. Excellent staff service on the newly refurbished 747-400 now with semi suites in first with new wider more comfortable seats. Noted that the left wide electric arms rests on 1 and 2k and 1a were not working. Engineer called on to plane to investigate but listed works to be done at later date. Extra cushions given to act as replacement arm rests. This plane is so much better than the A340 as the cabin has only one more seat but is more than twice the size of the A340 and as galley and WCs are at back its much more peaceful too new improved pyjamas and new seat pad forming a mattress makes the sleep better. Take the day flight out and the night flight back to get this plane instead of a340 until the A380 arrives (due nov 2014). Food was good - usual Dom Perignon and caviar and so too ground services at Bangkok.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,BKK-LHR 747400R on night flight. Excellent plane again on the newly refurbished 747 with suites in first. Lounge good at BKK although I must say that if you have a private sitting room as we did it is difficult to attract any attention from the staff. We always flight Thai first on long haul to the far east and until this flight have always been impressed with the staff service levels. However on this occasion they were: a) down one member of staff and b) used a staff member who had only worked in first twice. Thai cannot have provided her with any training so although she made every effort she had no idea how to serve dinner or drinks and was nervous and unsure throughout the cabin service. The Flight Manager explained that Thai now have a policy to shuffle staff between all classes and all aircraft types. That in itself is fine but please guys - do some training first! No wines offered with dinner (we had to ask and were brought an open bottle - no choice) No proper pre-dinner drinks service main courses were forgotten so we were offered fruit and cheese after the starter the wrong menu was used (we had pre-ordered) orchids were missing from the suites vases mix and match pyjamas long delays in clearing the tables so we had to ask for it to be done eventually. I still will recommend Thai unless this happens again next time. The saving grace was the helpful cabin crew and ground staff who retrieved my passport on landing at LHR which had fallen through a hole in the suite wall down into the floor (along with a large collection of menus safety cards mineral water etc) A design fault which need bunging up.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew Thai Airways for the first time from Bangkok to Sydney on 17 January 2014 and I wasn't disappointed at all. My seat was comfortable and nice. I would recommend you take the seat next to the emergency exit door as you will have a lot of leg room. Staff were very friendly and were happily chatting with me. Service during the flight was excellent! Inflight meals were very nice considering being in economy class. Inflight entertainment was also very good. I would really recommend Thai.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,CPH-BKK with 777-300ER 30/12/2013. Was in aft. cabin front row with extra space for legs. Everything was perfect best IFE I have seen. Great meals and all you can drink. BKK-FRA with 380-800 5/1/2014. Almost perfect. Was in fwd. cabin down stairs 2nd row. The seats can have a to large angle for your back comfy for your back but not for the passenger sitting behind you.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,6,Flew out of Melbourne to BKK just after midnight Jan 3. Flight was Ok although the 777-200ER getting old with angled lie flat seats in J class uncomfortable. But worthy of note was the appalling TG shared Air New Zealand lounge. Although our flt was just after midnight the lounge was virtually shut with staff in pack-up mode with little food and limit drinks available. Because of this unlikely to fly TG again. Melb TG dept lounge (for late departure) - forget. Better options!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,MEL-BKK-PNH-BKK-MEL on 21/12/13-11/01/14. Flights were on time catering was tasty and plenty of it flight crew are prompt and polite. Overall service are still good from Thai airways and I are definitely flying with them again after my 5 years absence.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,3,yes,5,TG 565 Dec 18th and return on TG 564 Jan 3rd. Pros: Good on time good choice for inflight entertainment. Cons: Food is not so as a few years ago (cold and not tasty). Choice of drinks is less (no alcoholic drinks). Service is low (they ignored me twice with food and drinks hence I had to call them.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,We flew LHR-BKK-SYD return over the Christmas / New Year period. 3 of the four legs were in the new refitted cabins which were very comfortable. The inflight entertainment in the new cabins was excellent - very wide variety of films on offer including many new releases and the screens are a lot larger than I've seen before. The older cabin (on the SYD-BKK leg) felt very old and dated - much less comfortable. Food sounded excellent on the menu but was hit and miss in practise. Overall excellent value for money.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew Melbourne to Bangkok on the slightly midnight flight and were very impressed with the on board service. We were greeted on board by the friendly staff using the traditional Thai greeting. Shortly after take off hot towels were handed out and an actual dinner was served. Staff were friendly and very professional and drinks were offered frequently and drink orders were promptly on request. Excellent on board entertainment system with a broad spectrum new release movies and TV shows to cater to every taste. Toilets were clean and seats were comfortable with a good pitch. Staff also went through the cabin frequently to collect rubbish. All food served was tasty and was not too spicy. On our return flight from Bangkok to Melbourne which left at 9.10 the service was again excellent and faultless. Definitely one of the premium full service airlines and has a slight edge over Malaysia Airlines in terms of food and on board entertainment.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,6,DEL-BKK-TPE-BKK-DEL. Definite evidence that certain sectors get 'preferential treatment' from certain members of the industry. While BKK-TPE is operated in a brand-new A332 BKK-DEL passengers put up with a dated B744 (with those reduced-height seats so you can see the big screen at the front of the compartment). Meal service is excellent on the TPE sector with crew coming round to offer extra rolls or on drink runs. Service on the DEL sector is gruff with crew forgetting your roll/drinks. Metal cutlery only offered on the TPE leg. Especially on the DEL leg the flamboyant colour scheme (pink yellow blue and purple as the four seats in the centre block) compounds the sense of chaos in the cabin.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,BKK-RGN-BKK. It's a while since I've flown them but I was very impressed. Flights on time bags off quickly great cabin crew and surprisingly good effort with the food and drink.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,JNB-BKK 7 Dec TG992. BKK-HKT 8 Dec TG201. HKT-BKK 15Dec TG204. BKK-JNB 18 Dec TG991. Used Thai Airways for the 1st time 7th Dec and on return 18th. Had a wonderful experience. Staff friendly and service good. Served drinks frequently throughout the flights. Food equally tasteful. Inflight entertainment fantastic with a big variety to watch and play.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,I flew TG910 from LHR-BKK on 17-Dec and onto BKK-Mandalay on TG2981. TG910 had large personal entertainment screens but movies and TV shows were all over 2 years old. Good attention from attendants - they came around frequently with drinks. Ran out of meal choices so I ended up with shrimp pasta and overdone veggies. Served dinner and breakfast. Bathrooms always clean. TG2981 was about 1.5 hours and served drinks and small box snack – why can't US airlines do this?
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew from Shanghai to Bangkok. TG663 flight was delayed a little bit due to the air traffic control. The announcement from the cockpit was clear. Inflight service was good. Cabin crew were hardworking and helpful. On the way back to Shanghai the flying time was 3.5 hours. Food and beverage on both flights were good.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,8,I used Thai Airways for the first time over the past two months flying MEL-BKK-MAD and CPH-BKK-MEL in economy and I felt satisfied overall with my decision to fly with this airline. On the older aircraft I was impressed with the generous legroom and width of the seat but it is evident that on the newer aircraft operating the Copenhagen route that such legroom is no longer present creating a more uncomfortable flying experience. The newer inflight entertainment on this route made up for this however proving more reliable than that on the other legs of my trip. Perhaps the best thing that Thai Airways has going for them however is their wonderful staff which I was unable to fault for the entirety of my trip. If the price was reasonable I would without a doubt use this airline again.
,,,First Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,BKK-HKT-BKK 18/12/2013 TG211. 19/12/2013 TG216 in Business. There is no seat selection or request possible on domestic flights in business. Even when you checking in online 24 hours before all seats are gone. I also travelled in F from Frankfurt to Bangkok and would like to say that the service is not up to date. The service is overpriced and has little features and benefits. The cabin attendants show little respect. Thai used to be a reasonable airline. Service on board is non-existent.
,,,First Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,BKK-HKT-BKK 18/12/2013 TG211. 19/12/2013 TG216 in Business. There is no seat selection or request possible on domestic flights in business. Even when you checking in online 24 hours before all seats are gone. I also travelled in F from Frankfurt to Bangkok and would like to say that the service is not up to date. The service is overpriced and has little features and benefits. The cabin attendants show little respect. Thai used to be a reasonable airline. Service on board is non-existent.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,18th December 2013 BKK-BOM-KKC on TG318 and TG040 respectively. Very helpful crew nice AVOD and great food. The AVOD was not there on BKK-KKC sector but considering it is only a 1 hour flight it doesn't matter. Nice and clean aircraft and on schedule worth the price and strongly recommended comparing with other airlines operating on these routes.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,BKK-CMB 13 Dec. Its Thai Smile operating this sector now which is close to a budget carrier but since it uses the same TG call sign many would not notice. New plane but cramped seats smallest portion of awful food. No IFE blankets or pillows for this red eye flight. The previous time I flew this route Thai had a newish A330 with full service and I had to pay the same price whilst flying Thai Smile which makes it a bad value for money.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,2,"I am very disappointed. Had a flight from Bangkok to Oslo. Slightly delayed but that was ok for me. When I got onboard I was impressed by how friendly the cabin attendants were. However that changed after a couple of hours airtime. The flight was 13 hrs. During that time the staff came around with drinks only twice. Yes 13 hrs and 2 cups of water. So after the first 3 hours I pushed the service button. There came this lady asking ""what do you want?"" I told her I would like something to drink. Her response was unfriendly and that I had to go back to the galley and get it myself. At the next meal handout the cabin attendant looked angry. I've never experienced anything like this I was calm and neutral at all times and still got treated this way."
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Oslo - Manila (via Bangkok). Have no complaints at all the flights were on time and crew were very helpful. Nice seats the food and inflight entertainment was good. The only negative thing was that on the flight between Bangkok and Manila the movie projector seemed to be malfunctioning as the screen image was almost all white. This was on both the flight there and the flight back to Bangkok.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,1,PER-BKK on 28 Nov 2013. I had a 1 year old and a 3 year old in tow upon reaching the gate in Perth I was told that Thai does not allow boarding of kids first. I had specifically requested a Bassinet seat for my one year old but none were available which I took in good grace as it was a day flight was not too much of a problem. On my return on 8th December (night flight) we were given a bassinet seat upon take off I asked the flight attendant for the bassinet to be provided so that the baby can sleep. Was met with a flat out no saying the baby was too big for a bassinet. He is 9kgs and according to Thai's own website the cut off is 13kgs. I asked 3 other flight attendants and they all said the same thing. Whenever I have travelled Singapore Airlines or even Qantas this has never been the case. So disappointed with the service levels. Never again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Extremely happy with all the aspects of my flights. Crew were very efficient despite the full plane on the Sydney - Bangkok leg and if they weren't particularly chatty or full of smiles this doesn't bother me. Food was also excellent and the inflight entertainment outstanding. I'm not a tall or large person but the legroom did seem more generous than my other airline experiences. Loved the 30kg baggage allowance too. I will definitely choose Thai again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,ICN-BKK-KUL. First time flying with Thai Airways and via Bangkok. Check-in at ICN was smooth and fast. The ICN to BKK was quite empty and had a row to myself. The entertainment system was good but B772 ICN-BKK screen was smaller than the new A330 BKK to KUL. The food on both sector were great one of the best. Service was great. Plenty of drink rounds by the cabin crews. The only problem was walking on the tarmac on both flight at BKK. Overall it was a pleasant journey and would fly with Thai airways again in the future.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,2,Why on earth is the A380 not on the LHR-BKK route? These old 747's should be pensioned off after 23 years despite the upgraded seats which are the most uncomfortable Biz class I've ever tried to sleep in all angles and too short for a chance of a good night on the 12 hour journey. Food for such a wonderful cuisine is a disgrace why can't they even prepare a simple stir-fry or a red curry? The cheese was a measly piece of plastic hard cheese and a triangle of factory brie have they been on Qatar recently? AV system is so outdated with limited film choice when compared to BA/CX and even EVA from Europe to Asia. Wines were all French high alcohol and totally the wrong choice for 38000 feet up we want low alcohol Riesling and Pinot. Flew on the date of the Kings birthday supposed special menu was a complete cock-up the poor crew had no idea what was onboard and changed my main choice 5 times. The only reason I still felt with them is I'm a gold member and get to use my million miles for upgrades once they're all gone I'm off in a flash. Despair.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,PNH-BKK on a AB6 and BKK-CDG on a A380. PNH-BKK was in Business and whilst only 1 hour was a great flight. The seats are comfy the service was good and the fact they could serve a hot meal and drinks in less than an hour was impressive. On arrival in BKK we were met and escorted directly to the First Class lounge which was great as not sure I would have found it otherwise! The service in the lounge was great very attentive. Also escorted from here to the next flight. The A380 suites are very comfortable. Service on-board very attentive and food excellent. Not the greatest of movie selections but a minor grumble. One oddity was that that if you wanted to use an arrival lounge you had to have requested it prior otherwise your into the Star Alliance lounge which is a bit of a zoo. Would definitely fly them again.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,3,no,4,Nov 16 2013 TG 476 SYD to BKK. The seat was comfortable. Food was quite poor for First Class some of it was not as described and some was inedible. Service was poor desite the fact that there was only two of us in First Class. When I asked for a top-up of ice my dirty glass was returned to me with the ice - lipstick marks and all. The toilets were continuously occupied by the staff so the two passengers had to wait - what a joke. Ground crew took forever to line up the portable staircase massive incompetence.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,"CMB-BKK-CMB. Beware of Thai Smile! I have to admit that I was not aware of Thai Smile before my experience on 23-26 Nov 2013. I booked my flight on the Thai Airways website the flights had a TG prefix and the confirmation email came from Thai Airways International. I deliberately chose Thai Airways as I wanted a quality of service better than the alternative of Sri Lankan Airways. The whole journey left me disappointed. I thought I was on a full service flight but obviously wasn't. The plane was new - but was incredibly uncomfortable due seat pitch and leg room. Staff are young immature and rather clueless about customer service. Food was nothing special. Thai Smile should be operated as a completely different airline and have a different prefix. I felt misled that I had booked a ""Low Cost Service"" whilst using the regular Thai Airways website. No where on the ticketing does it mention that it was Thai Smile service. I have flown Thai on many occasions and always been happy however now the reputation of TG has been shattered for me. I don't understand how you can interchange a LCC service with a premium service using the same airline code when clearly they are a world apart. I'm not a complainer but Thai Airways really need to address this."
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,BKK-HKT-BKK on an Airbus A300. Great plane. Pillows are on very seat. Heaps of legroom. The Plane was super clean. Cabin was becoming a little bit dated. Snack box was nice however the juice was way to sweet. It would be nice if cold beverages were served. Air show system was good as was the staff service. I would fly THAI on these short hops again.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,HKG-BKK-LHR-BKK-HKG and HKG-BKK-SYD-BKK-HKG all in First. I have not flown TG since I moved my loyalty to oneworld about 12 years ago and happy to say that they are still a very good airline. The legendary Thai service was very much at the fore on each sector and the food and wines while not outstanding were good to very good. Experienced both the A380 and the refitted 747 and prefer the 747 as it feels more intimate than the A380. After reading the glowing reviews of the First lounge in BKK my expectations were set very high but unfortunately I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong it's a perfectly nice lounge with extremely attentive service however with the ambient noise from the terminal its not really an oasis of calm and the place looks like it needs a refurb. The buggies to and from the aircraft are a nice touch given the enormity of Suvarnabhumi. TGs pricing out of HKG means they're extraordinary value for money compared to flying direct so I'll be using them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,Have flown SIN-BKK-SIN a number of times for work and it feels like each experience is worse than the last especially on the SIN-BKK leg. For whatever reason Thai has started using domestic aircraft for some of the SIN- BKK flights. This means old planes limited overhead storage and no inflight entertainment system. When my colleague once asked why we were on this aircraft the stewardess apologized and said it was a one-off. A lie because subsequent trips were the same. They also park the planes at the furthest possible corner of Suvarnabhumi airport so you have to climb down the ramp with your luggage take a 5-10 minute bus ride to a terminal and then a long walk to immigration. Same on outgoing to Singapore. Would not fly Thai on this route again if I had a choice.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,yes,6,"MEL-BKK-HKT-BKK-MEL. MEL-BKK food was good. Plane was clean but entertainment system did not work. No apologies from crew just ""don't touch for five minuets"". I was told in a stern voice. Crew came around with drinks regularly. However no smiles at all. Only smiles we got were from QF ground staff helping with boarding. Crew members just were pointing which aisles to go down. BKK-MEL. Food was inedible. It was a frittata with no taste at all. No one ate it. Dinner was disappointing. Plane was clean. Entertainment was good. Safety was lacking. Crew did not demo just played a video. They did not secure cabin for take off for example did not check seat belts foot rests chairs etc. Did not feel very safe. The check-in agent in BKK did not speak. Overall not the friendly. Next time I would fly Qantas."
,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,My ticket was purchased on Oct 16 for my travel of Nov 14 I had requested a vegetarian Hindu/Indian meal AVML in m booking which was shown confirmed in my ticket. I was served VLML instead vegan vegetarian meal on both the flights TG 402 SIN-BKK and TG 319 BKK-KTM. Apart from this the service of crew was excellent they were trying to give every passenger an exclusive feeling. The flight was smooth on-board entertainment and information more than satisfactory airport hospitality of the staff very good leg room in economy class was on par with the best I have travelled.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,BLR-BKK-PEK and PVG-BKK-BLR. Flights on time with comfortable seats and good leg room. The special vegetarian meal served was excellent one of the best I have had. Staff friendly and always smiling. Overall a satisfying experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,4,"Inflight entertainment needs serious updating and touch screen did not work properly. Vegetarian meal arrived to me as a ""Children's Meal"". Breakfast was inedible. Generally the Bangkok-Melbourne route is awful - due to cramped seats bad food no eye masks tiny and thin blanket and uncomfortable pillow. Better to go Singapore on an A380 as their service is by far superior."
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,5,TG676 BKK-NRT. Upper deck A380. Seat ok a bit boxy. My same complaint with CX and SQ…but frankly it is hard to appeal to everyone is a narrow tube of aluminium. Food so-so. TG gets a lot of mileage (undeserved) out of being a ‘cuisine capital’ etc but what arrives in front you does not always warrant those accolades.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,no,4,Flew overnight on Boeing 777 from Delhi to Bangkok fitted with new Business Class fully flat beds. I was very disappointed with the cramped space and could not sleep at all. Will not use flights with this seat again. Otherwise Thai is normally very good.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,SIN-BKK-AKL very satisfied to fly with Thai. They have some of the best food on board I flew with Malaysia Airlines to Auckland recently and I was more satisfied with Thai. Staff are very friendly full of smiles. The seats are excellent large leg room and they provide foot rests as well which is perfect for a long distance flight.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,We flew three flights recently NRT-BKK BKK-DEL and DEL-BKK. All was fine the service was excellent and the special meal ordered for my wife Indian veg was good. I was a bit disappointed by my meals. They were good but for biz class I thought they were a bit underwhelming. However beyond that we were very pleased with Thai Airways especially the gracious service.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,BKK-KTM business. Delightful crew who managed difficult passengers who believed they should be seated in business. This 'game' became more interesting as actual business passengers with boarding passes got on the plane. Food on this flight was brilliant - selection of three mains all of which I wanted to order. Entertainment great. The only flight ever where I've fallen asleep and woken up to find myself covered in a blanket by the most wonderful attentive crew. Loved this flight - just brilliant.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I did my first long haul flight from NZ to Bangkok and then returned with Thai Airways as well as domestic flights from Bangkok to Phuket and back to Bangkok. I found the service to be great on all flights. It seemed like we were fed constantly (even on the short 1.5 hour flights) and also offered drinks. The food was of a good quality. I'm not a very good flyer and to my surprise found I wasn't at all nervous for any of the flights. The onboard entertainment was fantastic with great movies and TV series to watch.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"Flew Thai Smile from Bangkok to Macau and back. Nothing to smile about considering its an International sector. Seats good for Thai""s anyone above 5'7 will find it very difficult to sit in. Food comes in a plastic bag - a bottle of water a small pudding a tiny sandwich. In spite of clear weather in Macau a day after Typhoon Usagi spared the area flight came in 3 hours late and further delay to land as only one runway operational in BKK - another 40 minutes late missed my connection to Krabi rude staff at airport refused to change my ticket to the next mornings flight until I complained. Sat at the airport for 14 hours. Thai Smile in the Land of Smiles for once didnt make me Smile! Never again."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,3,Domestic Bangkok-Khon Kaen. Aircraft a very old A300-600 which is looking very tired indeed. Cabin crew pleasant enough for this short 40 min hop. Refreshments and a snack is served in a box but really not worth opening. Announcements from the captain could not be heard or understood. You pay a premium fare for this route which is very poor value. Watch out Thai Air Asia are starting on this route soon.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,BKK to SYD. Again no AVOD system. After contacting the Thai airways office directly before booking my flight I was told we'd have the AVOD on the flight. No AVOD! this is the 3rd time in 3 years this has happened. The aircraft was old and seats were worn the padding in the back of the seat was compressed so much that it was like leaning on a rock. Staff were fantastic and food was ok.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,BKK-ARN. This airline should be upgraded to a 5-star rating. The cabin was clean and inviting the entertainment was terrific food was very good and the cabin crew was top notch. I was very impressed.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,7,Flown many times over the last 30+ years. Some attempt is being made to upgrade the fleet but it is slow going. Their premier route is surely BKK-LHR-BKK so why don't we have the A380 or new(ish) 777s only ancient 747s and A340s.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,Hong Kong to Bangkok in C-Class. Travelled on the A380. Seats very narrow and cramped. FAs efficient but not friendly. Very small food portions.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,TG 472 on 26th June 2013. SYD to BKK this flight was the best flight I have ever had on a 747-400. Leg room was great staff were nice flight was smooth and pleasant. I cant wait to fly Thai again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,,,5,yes,6,I flew with Thai round trip SYD-BKK in September. I had no trouble getting emergency exit seats and at no extra cost. The seats were comfortable. The meal provided from Sydney was Lunch and a snack before landing in Bangkok. It wasn't to bad. The Meals provided on Bangkok - Sydney were delicious. The inflight entertainment going was so bad and wouldn't load at all. On the way back there was no inflight entertainment at all. The FA's really didn't appear at all interested in their customer service. After breakfast was served on the return leg the cabin was darkened and the two rows of seats they had reserved by the galley were occupied by the FA's and there they sat talking and giggling for hours. I think Thai needs to perhaps encourage the FA's to provide a little more customer service than they do at the moment. Overall it was a good experience and I would use Thai on long haul again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,11/09 LHR-BKK TG917 returned 17/09 BKK-LHR TG916. Outward flight only half full in economy so managed to get a block of 4 seats in the middle and slept for 7 hours. Really disappointed with crew they seemed to be going through the motions and really could not be bothered with giving excellent customer service. Seating OK and entertainment system was good. Flight arrived 20 minutes early which was a bonus and luggage received within minutes. Overall good flight but have come to expect better service from the crew. Inward flight left 20 minutes late which was strange as only 100 passengers on-board. Lots of space to spread out and managed to get 4 seats again which meant some sleep again. Crew were excellent and restored some of our disappointment from the outward flight. Food was good and we received lunch and dinner. Flight landed 25 minutes late in LHR. Luggage came through pretty fast. Overall both flights were good but Thai need to make sure they improve some of their inconsistent crew.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,6,We flew from Bangkok to Milan on the A340 in Economy restricted this has to be without doubt the most awful long haul seats I have ever sat in there is no legroom whatsoever and a video box under the seat in front makes things even worse. We were due to return to Bangkok on the same plane 4 weeks later and had decided to bite the bullet and pay for business class as the thought of sitting in similar seats on the return was unthinkable when we tried to book the business class seats we were informed that there were only 70 passengers and we could have a row of four seats each in normal economy for no extra charge so we took them up on that. The economy restricted seats on the other leg (Auckland to Bangkok) on the 777 were fine and we had no complaints.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,TG474 28/8/13 Brisbane to Bangkok and TG225 Bangkok to Phuket. TG222 12/9/13 Phuket to Bangkok and TG473 Bangkok to Brisbane. Have just returned from Thailand. Have returned to Thailand twice with Thai and have found the service very good. They are fantastic with people with mobility issues and really look after you. I would have no hesitation at all in recommending Thai. The service between Phuket and Bangkok is a no frills service but between Bangkok and Australia is very good.
,,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Travelled SYD-BKK-VCO and back LHR-BKK-SYD - booked using Star Alliance points. Service was excellent both on the ground and in the air food good seat comfortable both for sitting and sleeping. Will definitely be doing this again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,JNB-BKK-JNB. Flight out from Johannesburg very pleasant crew friendly and food an improvement from previous flights I took on Thai. Return flight crew seemed to be doing passengers a favor by being there. Food at best can be described as mediocre even for economy standards. Overall very standard airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,BKK-LHR TG916 11 September 2013. Upgraded Boeing 747 was virtually empty on the lunchtime flight from Bangkok to London which meant most economy class passengers had plenty of room to stretch out during the 11.5 hour flight. Flight departed BKK on time and shortly after take off drinks were served. The upgraded 747 has AVOD throughout which is great and the film choices were great. Two meals were served during the flight (lunch and dinner) and both were very delicious. The crew were very smart and pleasant and made continuous rounds with water orange juice cola etc. and the flight landed in London 30 minutes early. All in all a very enjoyable flight indeed.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,TG930 BKK-CDG 26APR and TG931 CDG-BKK 13 MAY. It was the first time taking business class on the new A380 to/from Paris. I enjoyed the new flat bed seat very much. The seats are not aligned in the row so each passenger has his own privacy. I will definitely try this service again.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,4,BKK-HKG 5 Sep. Business Class seat configuration on A380's is the worst I have seen. The table arm hits your knees since it sticks out into the customers area even when the table is folded and stowed. The video/music controller is stowed in the armrest in a location where a passenger cannot avoid pressing the controls unavoidably. The bins against the window constantly pop open.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,Flew from Melbourne to Bangkok on 777-200 then onto Tokyo on A380. Returning from Osaka on the 747 to Bangkok and back to Melbourne on the 777-300. Thai service was excellent from the Melbourne service centre to the check in staff. The Thai crew were great. Very welcoming professional and efficient. The cabin crew on all legs of the journey were excellent but particularly the legs to and from Melbourne on the 777's. The seats on the 777's although not lie flat were comfortable and had heaps of leg room. The A380 was very comfortable. The Business Lounge at Melbourne (Air New Zealand) was quite good and spacious with wine sparkling spirits and beer. The food was okay. Osaka was cosy but very good. What was a little disappointing was the Thai Business Lounge at Bangkok 'C' wing. It was an evening flight and very crowded. No wine or champagne available and a very limited food offering. I expected more from Thai and this was an area that if improved would improve the total Thai Airways Business experience. Apart from the business lounge at Bangkok I was very impressed with the Thai service and aircraft. Clean on time and great service.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,3,yes,5,This airline is generally good with friendly staff and good food. Seat spacing in economy class is made for short Asians and probably not for taller Westerners. The leg space is minimal. It also depends on which flight and aircraft you hit you may be lucky (e.g. on route between Thailand and Malaysia) or unlucky (e.g. between Thailand and Pakistan) and hit the most likely worst operating aircraft still in service for Thai airways.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,BNE-BKK with brief stopover and BKK-PEK. Both in Business and flights were very good. The service was warm and genuine and cabins adequate (neither the 777-300 or the A330 had the new configuration). Food was plentiful and tasty and exceeded the quality of our last Thai First Class experience minus the Beluga. Wine was reasonable but on the second flight we were the last to be served in the cabin and were sometimes forgotten (e.g no peanuts offered slow to offer a second glass). On time departures and arrivals for both flights check in smooth with help from the kerbside at BKK remote lounge at BKK was OK but beginning to look at bit worn. In general of a high standard and the flights were enjoyable.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,yes,8,Bangkok to Chiang Mai in business class. Check in at Bangkok was smooth since there were no queues. Domestic royal silk lounge is brilliant for domestic lounge. When we got to the gate for boarding the flight was suddenly delayed 15 minutes for an unknown reason. Once we finally boarded the aircraft the staff were very friendly and all of them were willing to help you with anything. Seats on the B737-400 are not very comfortable due to the hard padding the tight legroom and the footrest which takes up even more of your legroom. Apart from the wide seats and smaller cabin I honestly felt like I was sitting in economy. Once we were all settled in the purser came around offering us a choice of drinks before take off. Not long after we took off the light snack was served. On this flight the snack was Cold Teriyaki Chicken with Salad which was not very nice. Apart from these small reasons Thai is a very good airline and I will definitely be flying with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,SIN-BKK-SIN. Thai airways was fairly expensive on this route however timings and frequency to Singapore provided piece of mind when transiting in Singapore. Website was good however when asked if you would like to select seats now you feel you may not have to know and can do it after the booking not the case so after a phone call to London office that was sorted. Check in and boarding very punctual in both Singapore and Bangkok. Food was amazing and service quick efficient with staff being very nice friendly and smiley! seat was more comfortable in the A330 than the 773. Inflight entertainment was very varied. Would definitely not hesitate to fly with Thai international again would recommend.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,BKK-SYD was one of the worst flights I have experienced. The Boeing 747 used on this route looked like it had never been maintained in its 20 years of service. The seats are so uncomfortable if you're 1.75m or taller you can't even lean you head back because the seat back is too short. There was no AVOD and no overhead monitors just a few projectors which didn't even work correctly. Service was not very friendly and food was also less than average. I would definitely not recommend flying Thai on this route until they consistently use state-of-the-art aircraft's.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,Once again flown London to Brisbane return via Bangkok and the service and cabin ambience in economy was brilliant. Main strength is the cabin ambience (food and beverage selection AVOD and hygiene). The newly retrofitted 747s are very comfortable and AVOD has a good selection of entertainment. I would strongly recommend Thai Airways as it always is a pleasant experience.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,"SYD-BKK CDG-BKK-MEL. First time flying Business Class and I was pretty impressed. SYD-BKK on 747 - upstairs cabin is very exclusive and calm in a 2-2 arrangement and very quiet. Seats are not fully-flat but perfectly fine for a day-time flight and I really liked the enormous storage bins on the windows - we didn't need to put anything in the overhead. 5 courses for lunch was a ridiculous amount of food! Crew appeared to have been doing their jobs a very long time and were just going through the motions. CDG-BKK a horrible airport in CDG but the A380 was excellent. Very comfortable fully-flat seats and nice big clean toilets. I am 6""1 and the bed was long enough for me. A380 is still quite loud if you are trying to sleep though. Crew seemed quite excited to be working the A380. Thai Lounges in BKK are a bit tired but plenty of space food and staff on hand and hardly anyone there. The chicken noodle soup is delicious! The final leg BKK-MEL was actually probably the best flight of all 3 - the 777-200 feels very very spacious in the J cabin even though its the same seat as the 747. Crew were upbeat and attentive food was good and the mood was very pleasant. Never a wait for a toilet on any 3 flights. Thai are a good but not great airline."
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Overnight flight BLR-BKK slightly older but well-kept 777. Aside from a 10-15 minute delayed departure with no announcements flight was excellent. Quick and friendly check-in surprisingly comfortable seat on board service and entertainment great food delicious - the best economy meal I've had in a long time. Very relaxed flight and super smooth landing.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,"My wife and I flew to and from Phuket from Brisbane TG474 / TG225 4th August. TG218 / TG473 20th August 2013. We are much travelled around the world. However we must say we were extremely impressed with the courtesy friendliness and efficiency of all the airline Staff both on and off the aircraft. This in spite of what we consider the travelling ""cattle"". Made our long journey pleasurable."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,Using the award ticket so it's my first time flying TG on long-haul economy. Turned out the B747 in service has had a refurbished entertainment system. The legroom was spacious surprising given they usually refurbish the aircraft to an often more crammed design. The service was good but mostly impressed by the quality of meal. Serving a little bit small for the entree but was very tasty. Staffs were very attentive and always offered drinks throughout the flight. The lavatories on the aircraft showed their age but didn't pose as a problem. Overall very satisfied and definitely was an improvement.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,3,I have used Thai Airways from Perth to Bangkok several times and usually have found the service good! However on Sunday 18 August the flight was 1 hour late in takeoff from BKK. I note this has happened before because it makes the flight late on return to BKK once after midnight arrival. Service on flight was poor to bad. And check in at BKK airport a disaster! I requested a seat farther to the front as of my age and legs but was put to the back of the aircraft!
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,Day flight from Sydney TG 476 suits me and back TG 475 even better with the next day landing. My first journey to Thailand was in 2010 on a Boeing 767 great then the next journey in an Airbus A340-600 probably the best jet I have flown. Then the 747-400 are in again all flights were on the refurbished Jumbos. Only one flight the cabin crew were very seasoned attendants. Why does the return flight TG 475 nearly always run late departure. To Sydney on Tuesday 13 August the jet departed at 23.50 a long wait at Suvarnabhumi airport and longer wait for passengers at Sydney for return.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,BKK-SYD. MEL-BKK. Flight out was on 747-400 and we sat downstairs in the mini cabin 2x2. The older crew were professional but lacked the warmth that one associates with Thai hospitality. You felt like they were just going through the motions. The food was pretty mediocre but overall it was a comfortable day flight. I was a bit worried about the noise from the kitchen next to our cabin but we didn't hear anything. Our flight back out of Melbourne was much more enjoyable - better aircraft (777) crew were attentive and smiling and the food was surprisingly very good. I think it's the best meal we've had on Thai. One thing we did notice was that the seats were not as flat as on our outbound flight. Not sure if they have 2 generations of seating or maybe our seats weren't working properly? The inflight entertainment had to be re-started a few times. Overall Thai is good value for money though the lounges are pretty standard.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Bangkok-Hong Kong on 747-400 in First. Initially I did not want to book F but the Price was only 100 Euros over Business and 200 Euros over Economy so decided to pamper myself. Pre-booked meal (Scallops) which was ok but not too special either maybe I should have opted for the meals offered in the Menu. The starter was very tasty though. Beverage selection very good Dom Perignon as welcome drink. Not the newest F Cabin but very spacious feeling and I really enjoyed the rather quick flight. As I flew in from Frankfurt into Bangkok I could use the Royal First Lounge which is always a very special treat. Had time enough for the 30 minutes Neck and Shoulder and Feet massage simply very relaxing. Also used the shower facilities there and started refreshed the leg to HKG. Overall very recommendable especially as the Price was extremely competitive.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,yes,9,Long weekend in BKK. Unfortunately my wife was taken unwell whilst we were there and the doctor didn't want her walking about on our return trip to SIN. Obviously we hadn't requested assistance at time of booking as didn't know we'd require it. No need to have worried - Thai did a great job whistling up a service agent with a wheelchair at Suvarnabhumi and called ahead to Changi so there was a wheelchair waiting at the gate there too. Well done Thai very impressed and genuinely grateful for the care shown to my wife.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,ZRH-BKK-HAN and back BKK-ZRH. Intercontinental flight on A340-600 BKK-HAN with A330. Smooth check in ZRH but the Panorama lounge they use in the midfield terminal is far less comfortable than the alternative Swiss lounge in the main terminal. Kindness and attentiveness of the FA were exemplary. Food was good but not outstanding. The seats are not as bad as such on the A340 but one keeps wondering why they have not gone straight for the flat bed option instead of this 170 degree version. On the A330 seats were old style with a touch of being worn out. No food choices which is surprising for C Class. Lounges in BKK are very comfortable. IFE comprehensive.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Frankfurt - Bangkok TG 921. Great flight on time. Flight attendants excellent and food great. Overall an excellent flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,"SIN-BKK: kudos to Myanmar Airways International with whom I was booked on this route - their flight was cancelled and I received a very gracious email from their station manager in SIN the day before travel with an e-ticket on Thai Airways attached. Check-in for the Thai flight was very slow comically so but after that everything went well - boarding was very quick and efficient despite the full load on a huge Airbus A340-600 in full long-haul configuration (8F/60J/199Y) - must be a treat to fly short haul in a flat bed. Even in economy the product was impressive with generous seat pitch (34"") on-demand entertainment and a full hot meal service despite the short flight time (less than 2h). Cabin crew were incredibly kind and friendly flight was smooth and landed on time. Immigration was very quick under ten minutes and bags arrived pretty soon. I'm not a huge fan of the aesthetics of Suvarnabhumi airport but it is very functional. Have never had a bad flight with this airline and for me their spotless record remains unblemished."
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,TG486: Perth to Phuket. Excellent flight to Phuket flight was on time the in flight service was incredible. The food was delectably delicious and the drinks were great very kind and attentive flight attendants who catered to our every need. The seat was excellent it reclined to a flat bed on an angle of 170 degrees blankets and pillows provided. Movie choice was good. TG485: Phuket to Perth. Again a good flight with Thai Airways a night time flight (12.30am departure) flight attendants served dinner and quickly cleared allowing passengers to go to sleep. Fruit and sandwiches served for breakfast.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,Flew FRA-BKK-MNL on July 12/13. A380 flight out of Frankfurt excellent highly recommend upper deck economy if you can book your seat in advance. Small cabin great attentive service. A330-300 from Bangkok to the Philippines was once again warm Thai hospitality first time using them wouldn't hesitate to again.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,BKK-BNE business. Boarding was problematic as the air bridge was not working and we had to be bussed to the aircraft. This delayed boarding and subsequently departure. As a result I missed out on the offer of welcome drinks magazines etc and had to request them specially. However these and other shortcomings that I reported to the FAs were promptly and pleasantly rectified. The seats are not flat bed and seemed on the narrow side but I was able to get some proper sleep. Food and drink were good.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,6,BKK-SYD-BKK Business Class on 747-400s as part of a longer itinerary from LHR to/from NZ. In both cases placed in upper deck of 747 which was a quiet but pleasant cabin. At BKK it is always a delight to be able to use the Royal Orchid Spa in advance of flying C Class on TG and that proved to be exceptional although the lounges themselves are looking tired. Boarding was reasonably orderly with a warm welcome. The angled lie-flat business class seat was fine for the SYD-BKK afternoon-evening flight as it is comfortable for relaxing reading watching movies and snoozing but found it difficult to get much of a sleep on BKK-SYD between the cabin being too warm and sliding down the seat. Service from cabin crew was friendly and efficient. The meals were adequate although not outstanding. All but one of the main courses and desserts were mediocre but the starters and range of drinks were quite good. Inflight entertainment system had a wide range of movies and reasonable TV and music selections enough to keep me occupied. Only downside was an excessive level of high volume announcements so loud that it is deafening through the headphones. Thai's Business Class is ok but the angled lie-flat seating has had its day and it could do with a bit more effort in quality of catering (certainly the quantity and range of choices were reasonable) which would complement the excellent cabin crew.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,BNE-BKK economy. A day flight. Boarding was early and departure punctual. The catering and IFE were up to Thai's usual high standards for economy but the seat pitch was not their normal 34”inch but significantly less and felt cramped.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,yes,2,TG 561 from Hanoi to Bangkok on June 28th. Staff performance is low they seemed to be very stressed since the flight was full due to summer holiday. Food was bad and cold. Alcohol drinks only on request. They were stressed if you asked for immigration applications. No inflight entertainment. Even though we came in on an A330 we had to stop at a parking position on the field and be taken by bus to the terminal. They built an airport for 45 Mil. guests/year and we have to travel by bus.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,LHR to BKK return. First time back on Thai since the upgrade of entertainment. Much better now. Seat didn't feel any different than before still standard economy seats (hard and cramped). So until I can afford to turn left instead of right on boarding then I will just have to live with it. FA's all good. Food was very nice particularly liked the prawn pad thai on return leg. Beverages bought round on a regular basis. Overall very happy with flight and aircraft.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Business class MEL-BKK-FRA-MAN. Excellent all the way FA's attentive and responsive to requests. Food great. Bangkok - Frankfurt on A380 great flight absolutely no problems lounges excellent. Great flight.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,3,no,5,Flew BKK-DME-BKK Business class day flight. No flat bed still on this long haul flight. Food same as economy class served in aluminium container. Staff not very friendly.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,London to Bangkok flight out 22/6/2013 return 6/7/2013 flight 916 and 917. Great company to fly with planes are clean very comfortable. Staff are willing to help. Food was the best we have had.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,4,Return LHR to BKK on retro fitted 747 worst business class flights in many years all meals out of LHR awful service well below par food a bit better on return as was service but what really lets it down is the seats nowhere near flat bed could not get comfy enough to sleep on either flight. Very uncomfortable could not wait to get of the plane. Will go back to flying BA for a same price much better product.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,LHR-BKK-HKG-BKK-LHR. Flew on 747 on all segments. Updated seats on all legs except HKG-BKK. New business seats on 747 have good IFE screens but are still angled lie flat. It seems bizarre that Thai decided not to install fully flat seats meaning that the new seats are not a significant improvement. Food mediocre to poor in lounges and onboard. Pre-ordered Thai food ex-BKK was of a higher standard than rest of food. Good service.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,Economy round-trip from SIN-ARN via Bangkok. Found their service to be patchy: it was great on TG 410 (SIN-BKK) and TG 403 (BKK-SIN) acceptable on TG 961 (ARN-BKK) and lukewarm on TG 960 (BKK-ARN). I didn't like that they didn't have kid-sized headphones for IFE - my tiny 5-year old held hers up to her ears for the whole journey. On the ARN-BKK and BKK-SIN legs there was not much difference between my special meal and the kids' meals. They also did not give the kids any 'goody bags' except for the BKK-SIN leg where they presented my kids with lunchboxes filled with snacks. FAs didn't do their rounds much during the night portion of the BKK-ARN leg they did it more frequently during the ARN-BKK leg though they ran out of the snacks as many passengers were peckish during the night (between dinner and breakfast service). On the BKK-SIN route we got to travel in a new plane and were impressed.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flying from BKK-FCO FRA-BKK on Thai Airways was an excellent experience. Flight crew always smiling sincere and attentive. and the ground handling was superb.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Just returned from a round-trip from Sydney to Frankfurt via Bangkok. I chose them as the stopover time in Bangkok is a mere 1.5 hours in Bangkok and they operate the A380 on the BKK-FRA leg. First time flying Thai and I would definitely choose them again. I enjoyed their in-seat onboard entertainment in particular the big touch screens on the A380. In contrast to other reports I found the service and food offerings good. It was a welcome plus that none of the flights that I took were booked out so that I always had at least one free seat next to me twice even a whole row of three for myself.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,First Class BKK to FRA. Excellent flight on A380. Seats were comfortable and the crew attention was just right. I found the cabin to be a bit bland. Most Thai aircraft have some artwork or color in the cabin but this was not the case on the A380.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,I have only recently started flying with Thai Airways between Dhaka and Bangkok as their flight times are much better than that of Bangkok Air. Flights are always on time departing Bangkok but are occasionally delayed out of Dhaka. Most of the time I find the crew friendly and helpful (I have experienced a few grumpy one). Aircraft's are clean and well maintained. The food is OK but nothing special and they have a very limited range of alcohol in Economy Class. The thing I like most about Thai is the amount of leg room in Economy and they have a great selection of on-board entertainment (movies music TV etc.)
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Business Class ICN-TPE-BKK. Elegant service and tasty food - well served and presented. Thai staff make one feel welcomed and are attentive without being clingy. Though relatively short segments the range of service and quiet competence was just a delight.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,CDG-BKK on A380. Flight delayed due to air traffic control not giving clearance but crew kept the passengers well informed. Served juice and snacks while on ground. Flight was very clean and crew was very friendly. Juice and water was served very frequently.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,My wife and I have just arrived in Bangkok after flying on TG466 Melbourne to Bangkok. The service was excellent. The flight left 10 minutes late but arrived 20 minutes early. Seat 32 H and J with seat H having no seat in front of it. Staff very good with regular service of drinks. the meals were Ok and typical airline food. I would recommend Thai economy again particularly if you can get the right seat for the right price. I am 192 cm and 112 kgs so it makes a difference.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,yes,6,Banglore - BKK- Hong Kong and Hong Kong - BKK - Mumbai in business class. Outbound on 16th June and returned on 21st June. Flight from Banglore to BKK to HKG was good especially loved the A380 on the BKK-HKG sector. Banglore - BKK flight was good. Seats on A380 were really good and afforded good privacy. The AVOD was not great except on the A380. The business lounge in Banglore was ok but the lounge at BKK was not great even though it is the home of Thai Airways. The business lounge at HKG was the best. The food served on the flights was good and staff were nice and attentive. The worst flight was BKK - Mumbai. The seats were a little better than economy movement was too restricted and the calf support only moved a small distance.If you have to sleep it was a very odd position. The AVOD screen was really small and low resolution. The food served on that flight was also not very good. Overall except for the last flight the experience was good.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,2,no,4,TG 920 from BKK to Frankfurt on 23rd June 2013. Flight facilities were ok but the food was dismal. For breakfast they ran out of pancake option half way and did even say sorry to the customers. As we pay for our flights it is the duty of the airline to make sure customers get what they ask for. Otherwise they should not mention that in the menu card. It is very unprofessional to say that they do not have an option which is already mentioned in the menu as an option. Flight attendants were not very attentive. I enjoyed the inflight entertainment programmes. Next time I will think twice before choosing Thai Airways.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,2,BKK-Sapporo-BKK A330 J class. Very disappointed with the food and service both outbound and inbound. It seems that their service keeps deteriorating each time you fly with them. Lunch was simply inedible (inbound). They served a piece of boiled fish (hard as rock) on top of white rice and white sauce. This simply isn't a premium business class service anymore. Having flown Thai many times it is noticeable standards have fallen.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,3,yes,7,I have had gold card with Thai over 20 years now normally I fly business odd time first class this trip business was full so had to do economy on TG910 BKK-LHR. The new upgraded 747 has screens with fantastic entertainment on each seat now but this has caused a problem as they have fitted the entertainment controller into the left hand side of the seat eating into your seat space and I found it very uncomfortable and a tight fit. The food was ok the staff were friendly professional and attentive.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,We have just returned from a trip to Thailand and Vietnam which involved 4 flights with Thai airways. The service was consistently excellent friendly and efficient. The long haul flights (London-Bangkok) were particularly outstanding. They were very comfortable and the food choices are a great added touch. We visited Thailand and Cambodia last year for our honeymoon which also involved a number of flights with Thai airways. We experienced the same high standard on each flight.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,NRT-BKK. Business on A380. I like the A380 a lot generally and Thai's new Business class product designed for this equipment is a huge improvement over other iterations of Business in the Thai fleet. Unfortunately they have not done away with the lurid purples and pinks but otherwise the staggered 180 degree life flat seating units are excellent. Staggered arrangement gives lots of privacy though window lovers will find that in every second row the main armrest with its storage remote control and reading light etc is between you and the window itself. Nonetheless the whole deal works and works well. The seat is wide enough and long enough though the alcove for one's feet is a little narrow. There is a lot of storage a huge fold down table and a good sized HD screen though the range of IFE selections is Thai's usual humdrum which seems to be much the same as UA's IFE. Cabin service started out very attentive and graceful but after dinner the FAs pretty much disappeared did not answer the call bell and seemed miffed when I poked my head into the galley to ask for water. As for the food well it was as usual with Thai's business class product not good. Interestingly enough the next day I flew with Bangkok Airways on a short domestic hop and the food in coach was way better than Thai's business class dinner on the leg from NRT.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Flying with TG to Singapore on flight TG403 and back to BKK on flight TG410. Overall services overwhelming. Seat comfortable. Meal served onboard absolutely great. Crew and ground staff very professional. In-flight entertainment wonderful.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,The flight to and from Bali respectively TG 431 and TG432 were both excellent and the food and service were both exceptional and so was the flight to BKK on TG432. The Lounge in BKK was adequate but no red wine. The lounge in Bali was not acceptable.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Flying in J class BNE-BKK-HKT-BKK-BNE was a fantastic trip. Crews were excellent. The service was very good. The seat was reasonably ok and comfortable enough to sleep. Would fly with TG again.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,4,PER-BKK-LHR quite unhappy with the experience thought the value of the tickets would pay out. Very dissatisfied with the food and seat very disappointed with the staff service aircraft is very small but noisy aircraft felt gloomy and dirty with not enough legroom. Overall very disappointed.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,8,Bangkok - Phuket A300-600 05/19/2013. Nice service and good pitch on this short flight 1 hrs 10 mins. Clean cabin. No seat back entertainment.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,12 June BKK-KTM. I have to say this flight was by far the best flight I have experienced in terms of service provided inflight flying Thai. FA's were smiling pro-active and very professional which is a rare combo currently with Thai staff. The food was good and the 777 used for the flight clean. If only all of Thai's FA's were this good at their job.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Have flown to Bangkok / Phuket twice with 2 children. Staff professional always helpful and polite. Great food and comfortable seating. I recommend Thai and will no doubt choose to fly with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,no,4,CPH-BKK 777-300ER. Pitch on this new aircraft is bad pitch 32 inch compared with former 744 on this route. (34 Pitch ). Seat 51A window. Narrow and cramped seat managed to have my leg between the aircraft wall and seat. Middle seat is impossible to sit in if you are over 180 cm. I'm 184 cm long. Seat pitch is very important on long haul routes. I'm not going to recommend Thai Airways 777-300ER on long haul flights. Thai have always been good in seat comfort on its long haul fleet but this is not true with the 777-300ER.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,no,6,SYD-BKK and BKK-USM-BKK-Chiang Rai. I am not overly enthusiastic about this airline. The Cabin Crew always seem to be very rushed and not so polite. Whenever I am in Thailand people seem to smile wherever you go but never for Thai Crew. They always seem to be disinterested and annoyed by passengers. Food was fair AVOD was good but the feeling they left was unsatisfactory especially because of the rude Crew. Not just on one leg but on all sectors.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,1,Flights TG917 and TG916 Boeing 747. Dissatisfied with Thai Airways this time. Food was awful only ate a small amount of fruit all meals were unappealing. Would not travel Business Class again - not worth the money. Going out from Heathrow to Bangkok my partners screen did not work we booked seats on the upper deck in January rows 26 going out and 16 on our return. Arrived at Bangkok airport at to check in for flight and was told a passenger had just booked our seat. Onboard when we asked for a gin and tonic told they had run out and offered champagne.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew from LHR to BKK return. Online check in didn't work however check-in at airports was straightforward and quick. All staff were friendly throughout food was decent for plane food and entertainment pretty extensive. We landed as scheduled; for the money Thai were exceptional.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,CPH-BKK-DPS-BKK-KIX. All flights except BKK-KIX in Business with the last sector in First. Elegant service on all legs and the gentle attention to detail was consistent across all the flights. I first flew TG in 1966 and that impression has held up for decades. The food is tasty and beautifully presented and the staff - from beginning to end was delightful. With more than 40 years of travel with them I remain a huge fan.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,TG206 12.10pm Phuket-Bangkok 23/5/2013. Staff very attentive. TG409 4.25pm 23/5/2013 Bangkok-Singapore. Staff the best I have experienced for years! I left my ipod on the above flight and the hostess had it delivered to Singapore that night. TG556 Bangkok-Ho Chi Minh 2/6/2013 crew very offhanded very disappointing as I always fly Business Class. Was treated rudely.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Paris - Bangkok on board Thai's A380. Spacious cabin huge windows excellent IFE good food informative PA's from captain friendly flight attendants clean bathrooms and best of all: water and juice handed out every 30-45 minutes even through out the night - much appreciated! Flawless flight.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,6,MEL-BKK. More comfortable than economy but otherwise this version of Thai's business class product is at best not quite up to par and at worst very poor. On this 777-200 the pod style seats looked plastic and worn out with obvious signs of age and wear. Seat control module was not always responsive upholstery was exceptionally hard. Slightly angled full recline was not a major issue for me but the short footrest area was as my feet dangled over the end and dragged me ever closer to the floor. IFE is unexceptional and the screen and controls very old fashioned. Food was much lower in standard than economy food on SQ MH or CX. FAs tended toward the sullen some with very poor English indeed. Nevertheless they were attentive throughout the flight. The whole experience was mediocre. It's a long flight and a busy route for Thai and they might think about treating their Australian customers better.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,BKK-KIX After a very humdrum and sometimes shoddy Royal Silk business class service from MEL switched to Royal First for the red-eye to Osaka on an ageing 744 with Thai's brand new first class product and it was excellent. Only 9 suites now in the 744 nose and each quite private though without the doors of Emirates and Singapore. Gone are the lurid pinks and purples now replaced by wood finish and beige's and neutrals. Very dignified and restful. The new seat is a fully flat bed with good bedding and comfort wear and it was so comfortable and the atmosphere so hushed I slept for much of the leg. Huge HD flat screen promised fine IFE but I settled for a canapé and a glass of Dom Perignon from a gracious FA who reminded me of how service used to be on Thai back in the 1980s. Gently woken for a superb Thai breakfast of steaming hot and spicy rice soup with shrimp decent coffee and some delicate conversation wit the wonderful FA as we began descent into KIX.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,Bangkok-Sydney-Bangkok TG475-TG476. Check at Suvarnabhumi airport is swift with designated and exclusive for all TG first class and business class passengers. Express baggage check and immigration were also exclusive as well. Flight was full including business class which make the boarding and settling in a bit of a mess and not quite so smooth as silk. I am not a great fan of the cocoon type seats but it is pretty comfortable good width and for sure plenty of length. The entertainment system is efficient but it still felt a bit worn down and dated. However the choice of TV movies radio were good with very wide range. The most disappointed about the flight is the food. Even though it was better than many airlines it still felt like economy class food in a nicer china. In all it wasn't that bad and with many obvious positives points but I was expecting more in all aspects.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,5,yes,9,CNX-HKT A320-200 HS-TXF. Flight with Thai Smile duration 2 hours. Good boarding very quick. FA very polite and professional. A lot of info from Captain. Did not eat the food but was a box with sandwich and some fruits and a cold drink. Little bit of turbulence but in all smooth flight. Seats very comfortable. Would use again. No IFE.
,,,First Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,no,6,"HND-BKK-SYD in first class. Told on the overnight HND-BKK flight that there was no turn-down service offered which was surprising given that it was a 5.5 hour flight that departed at midnight. The F cabin on the leased Jet Airways 77W was scuffed and worn but seat was comfortable enough. I didn't eat anything on this service other than some fruit before descent. The requisite golf-buggy was waiting for me on arrival at BKK but it was irritating to have to be security-screened in the middle of my transfer to the lounge and again when heading back to the gates. Ground services were good water pressure in the showers of the F lounge were pathetic. BKK-SYD on a 747-400. This model is geriatric now and the 10 F cabin whilst better than the dreaded 14 F setup that has now gone is still outdated and far from the best. Crew friendly and polite but rushed through breakfast prior to closing all the shades in the cabin for 5 hours and rushing through dinner prior to landing. Requests to slow down went unneeded. Note that 4/10 F seats were occupied so one can hardly apply the ""full cabin"" excuse. My seat malfunctioned on 747 and it was a pretty ordinary pair of flights. Crews on both services seemed to be in a hurry to get us dealt-with which is not acceptable in J let alone F. Disappointed and won't fly Thai again."
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,FRA-BKK on 340-600 in Business seats 12J/K. Overall very pleasant: Boarding efficient pre departure drinks came quickly jackets were not hung though. Food orders were taken before takeoff adhoc special request for a slightly differently composed breakfast (noodle soup instead of western breakfast) was accommodated perfectly food quality was quite good. FAs attentive and friendly. Seat angled lie flat slightly difficult to fall asleep in however I then got about 6 hrs of uninterrupted sleep so that was OK. Entertainment up to par amenity kit good only slippers would have been nice. Priority immigration at BKK with Thai C BP worked fine luggage already on carousel when we came out. This was a pretty god experience and frankly I wonder about the multitude of bad reviews for Thai - I was more than satisfied.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,2,yes,8,Round trip Oslo-Bangkok in Silk Class. Every time I fly I am surprised of the relatively uncomfortable seats in business class on this route. As I have a THAI gold card a plus is the warm welcome upon boarding including mentioning of my name etc. after sitting down. They are also serving you food prior to the rest of the passengers. However I had to wait 15 minutes to get anything to drink. Long after I had had my meal.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,BKK-NRT on B777-300ER May 9 2012. Aircraft leased from Jet Airways. Waited with a large group of people checking in for various flights. Used the kiosk to print boarding pass and select seat. Upon check-in had both my bags weighed and was told one was overweight. I was moving back to Canada after 5 years in Thailand so not surprising I had accumulated many items. Check-in agent waited patiently while I redistributed luggage and moved items to carry-on. Received boarding passes for all my flights to my final destination. Aircraft was clean and received juice and water at regular intervals. Was not given vegetarian option for breakfast probably because I didn't inform the Bangkok office of Air Canada about this though I booked it on my itinerary but had a nice omelette for breakfast. Flight left on time and had a superb AVOD system which kept me entertained for the flight. Cabin crew was professional and smiling. Enjoyed my last flight on Thai Airways and would definitely fly again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,no,4,Mumbai to Bangkok last night. There was no ptv they ran out of non veg meals. Staff were welcoming seats were a bit hard but a pole covering the space so not good leg room. When you push back your seat you can see the passengers behind you. Very old aircraft's they had one TV in the front which you could not see at all and very bleary. Have a snack before flight on this sector and take some entertainment because you will get very bored. I do not recommend this flight even though it is a 747-400.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,TG917 25th April. Excellent customer service. As an ROP Gold member I've noticed improvements in the service provided by Thai. At check in my travelling companion and I received a warm welcome. I advised the gentleman at check in that I had reserved seats. He checked the system and advised that the adjacent seats were now occupied so he arranged for us to be seated in the row behind where we would be the only occupants in a row of four seats. Lounge was comfortable with an improved range of food including hot choices. Onboard the attendant addressed me by name welcomed me aboard and asked for our dinner / breakfast selection. Only issue with getting dinner before anyone else is that the meal is finished before the wine is served so I asked for wine to come with the dinner which it did. Drinks were plentiful throughout and the new AVOD was good. I did have some concern that the under seat AVOD box might be intrusive but it wasn't. Empty seats allowed us to stretch out and get a reasonable night's sleep. Flight attendants genuinely did their best to ensure a pleasant flight. Hard and soft product equally good.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,6,BKK-FRA-BKK Business class check in and boarding went smoothly on both legs. I was assigned seat 25K and was surprised to see that the FA drinks station was on the other side of the seat with no partition. It appears that rather than provide a decent work area in the rear of business class Thai have opted to jam in more seats and put the drinks station between the rear toilets and emergency escape door - not very well thought out at all. FA's were attentive and smiling but the food really is mediocre and needs improvement.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,MAD-BKK and onwards to Manila. Flight from Madrid on a brand new 777 half empty and plenty of seats to stretch. Staff very good and attentive but meal surprisingly and disappointingly mediocre. Plenty of drinks rounds and requests met with a smile. AVOD entertainment adequate but not comparable to Qatar Airways. BKK-MNL delayed almost 2 hours awaiting connecting passengers. Flight very full on a tired A330 without any personal entertainment. No air conditioning while waiting and drinks only available on request. Food forgettable and legroom pretty bad. As one of the previous reviewers points out Thai can get away with a low service standard on this route because of the lack of competition.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,no,4,BKK-FRA A340. Not what I expected left disappointed. No personal AVOD makes for a long 11 hour flight. Service from FA's was average took late night flight so I don't recall food quality probably slept through it. Aircraft was worn but clean ladies received orchids upon departure. Probably won't fly Thai Air in the future. I do recall seats being very thin and uncomfortable.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,2,no,4,TG476 SYD-BKK 12/4/13. It was a bad move from Thai Airways to replace the aircraft on this route from 777-200 to the super old 747-400. The inflight entertainment was down due to technical issues and about 35 pax had the same issue with me. The cabin crew and services are fantastic. Meals were okay. I ended up sleeping the whole way because there was no inflight entertainment for my 9hr journey. The way back was TG 471 BKK-SYD 26/4/13 I was on the 747-400 again but this aircraft has no personal screens. Obviously Thai is going down because the competitors on these route are using brand new fleets but Thai turned to the opposite direction. Very disappointed!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,RGN-BKK-CTS and NRT-BKK-RGN. Service on the RGN-BKK-RGN leg was abrupt and disinterested as is usually the case. But the flights from Bangkok to Sapporo and return from Narita were both excellent. As a Gold Card holder I received priority meal service (this is not a standard practice on TG) and crews were friendly and efficient. From NRT-BKK the service was wonderful - warm attentive and energetic cabin crew made the flight a real pleasure. Drinks were regularly topped up and crew aimed to please. Food was average but the IFE was excellent with a great variety of recent releases. Overall I was very impressed with TG on their flights to/from Japan and their crew really excelled.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LHR-BKK on retrofitted 747-400. Good seats with big pitch superior IFE and although the food was average it was fine. The staff are really great too and my 3 year old was given lots of attention and a good in flight pack. Much better than BA.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,4,Manila - Bangkok on a tired old A330. Cabin and entertainment system from the 1980s no seat back TVs. Food very average. The only direct full service competition on this route is Philippine Airlines and Kuwait Airways and as average as Thai was on this occasion I still think they were the best choice. Flew Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Manila what a difference. Same type of aircraft but modern clean seat back TVs in seat power point nice meal. Thai are able to get away with older aircraft and poorer service on this route because of the low standard of the competition. I'd like to try them on Bangkok - Singapore and see how they measure up when passengers have SIA as an alternative.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,"TG750/751 BKK-MFM and vv. 15 and 19 April 2013. These are operated by ""Thai Smiles"" but still carry THAI's TG flight numbers. Cabin is nice and clean. Meals are above average and beyond expectations from the low cost airlines."
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,TG 653 Seoul - Bangkok Airbus 320 Economy. Having flown Thai Airways on long haul flights in the past I had no hesitation in using them again for a shorter flight. Overall the seat in economy is quite possibly the most comfortable economy seat I have had. The flight was only 7 hours due to a quick stop in Taipei but got up from the seat well rested. Flight entertainment was excellent with a great selection of movies etc. Staff were pleasant food was good no problem getting a drink overall an excellent flight certainly one to remember.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,TG 911/916 LHR-BKK and return. Have recently returned from a holiday in Thailand and used Thai airways for the long haul flights plus four domestic flights to Koh Samui and Krabi. The seats were extremely comfortable the food excellent inflight entertainment excellent and the staff could not have been more attentive. Although I am not able to sleep during flights my husband managed to sleep without any problems! However there was more than enough choice on the in-flight entertainment with several very recently released films available. Probably the best flights we have ever taken and highly recommended.
,,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,A380 First Class from Tokyo to Bangkok cabin almost empty only 4 passengers for 12 seats. I had chosen 1A I understand now from the reviews you're better off with Row 2. Food was mostly very good. Liquor menu is also limited no Crown Royal or comparable blend. The seat was very comfortable.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,SYD-BKK-PKT-BKK-SYD on 27 March and return 10 April. Proved to be a very enjoyable flight. Seat pitch is a true 34 inches I'm 6ft 5 inches and need space. Attendants were efficient and the food was better than average airline food. Back of seat entertainment was excellent with many choices. Staff kept toilets clean. Schedule was on time on all flights and generally it was a good experience. This is the first time I've flown Thai and I will definitely consider them in the future.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,4,BKK-MFM-BKK and BKK-HKT. All flights on time new A320. Terrible seat pitch 28in. Friendly service but just a plastic bag with water and a sandwich. Not to compare with Thai Airways but they sell it under the same brand also TG flight number. I will not book them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,Economy Singapore-Bangkok TG408. Flight slightly delayed and I got bitten by the Changi Airport habit of misinforming people of the start of boarding. Boarding started 30 minutes later than the flashing signs indicated. Boarding was a little bit chaotic and started before an announcement was made. As a Star Alliance Gold member I like being able to board earlier than other passengers. Got a choice of newspapers. Luckily headphones were handed out during the long wait for departure and the entertainment system worked the whole time during landing and take-off. We got the choice between fish-rice and chicken-noodles. I went with the noodles. Easily the best dish I've eaten on a flight (business or economy). A simple dish yes but excellent executed. Service was good with the only remark that the second offering of drinks came from behind and took me and other passengers by surprise. The stewardess was apparently in a hurry. If you ask people if they want another drink please wait for an answer and try not to break the 100m sprint record. But this was the only remark for an otherwise very pleasant flight. Seat comfort was OK (I am 1m 81 tall).
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,2,BKK-SIN TG401 11 Apr. I will follow up from my previous comments and say it almost seems that their service keeps deteriorating each time you fly with them. 11 days into the month of April and they still have March's inflight entertainment guide. The inflight crew along with the inflight manager were very cold and did not have the charmingly friendly smile. To end the terrible service run they forgot to serve me my meal as well and when brought to their notice was followed by the all too common sorry. If long transit times were not an issue for me I would have stopped flying Thai it is just not worth flying Business Class with them anymore.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,Melbourne-Bangkok-Phuket return. Melbourne to Bangkok the aircraft was clean and in good condition and staff were wonderful. On the return flight I could have been forgiven for thinking I had changed to a different airline. The staff had little or no interest in the passengers and seemed to ignore the requests for assistance. The food quality also dropped on the return leg. I had expected more from Thai.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,7,CDG-BKK-HKT. Last evening flight for Thai. Check-in in Paris was far from acceptable. I did not print my ticket and could not locate it on my phone. Security agent refused to let me go into check in although I pledged I was flying with Thai. A security supervisor came and intervened and I was allowed to the check in counter. Once at check-in it took the agent over 30 minutes to process! She then refused to give me the boarding pass as she said she could not locate my return ticket. I told her this is because it was a separate ticket to Vietnam and I showed her the e-ticket stored in the phone. It then took her over 10 minutes to clear with somebody on the phone. Once on board the 777 it was usual Thai friendliness and quality. My seat and my neighbour's failed after take off. Cabin crew did not bother fixing it and just asked us to move to other seats as there were plenty empty seats. The television in the 2nd seat did not work and I was moved to yet another seat. Transfer in Bangkok smooth but TG Domestic lounge facilities were basic. BKK-HKT short but the cabin crew managed to serve food and very friendly as well. It is comfortable but all facilities on board or on the ground seem to be old and worn.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,,3,yes,7,"MEL-BKK-MEL in Boeing 777. Business Lounge at Melbourne Airport (shared with Air NZ) is tatty and tired with worn dirty carpets and furnishings very poor snack selection and a general air of neglect. Outbound aircraft was a bit tatty and worn too with the customary small and hard business class seats often found on Asian airlines generally and of course they are at an angle even when ""flat"" so unless you strap yourself in firmly you will slowly slide down onto the floor. Inflight service was adequate but rushed and wine top ups had to be requested. Inflight movies and entertainment was excellent with lots of new release movies. Return flight was in a newer cleaner aircraft but the same issues with seat and service applied. Overall I'd rate Thai as ""OK"" but there are better options."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,4,no,5,JNB-BKK-JNB. Crew on outbound flight friendly on the return flight totally indifferent. Food ex Johannesburg absolutely disgusting even for airline food. Food from Bangkok edible. Having flown Thai many times before it is noticeable standards falling.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,4,yes,4,Flew LHR-BKK-RGN return and chose Thai on grounds of price and timetable convenience. Some years since I last used Thai and whilst the service was charming and friendly other aspects left much to be desired. In particular the seats although almost lie flat (would it cost much more for 100% flat?) were difficult to adjust for a comfortable sleep. The food was almost inedible even the pre-ordered meals.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,"MNL-BKK-MNL. Fast check-in in both airports and had an organized system of boarding. The flight went pretty well as expected. Flight crews were efficient and prepared and had plenty of smiles. The Inflight entertainment options were pretty limited but fairly good for a 3 hour flight. Food is great. Two of the flight attendants on our return trip clearly manifest hospitality and the feeling of ""thanks for flying with us""."
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,2,no,3,Having submitted a less than positive review of my Bangkok Paris business class trip I am bound to do the same for my return. Alas the same problems: thin and uncomfortable seat poor selection of newspapers and magazines on board (is it so difficult to stock more than Bangkok Post IHT and Fin Times along with Time and golf mags? The airport itself was busting with reading material) and the food my wife and I agreed was simply inedible. My beef was too hard to cut accompanied by poor roast potatoes and a selection of tasteless cheeses. Staff were okay and there were many spare seats. Poor Thai: once a great airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,Couldn't have been happier with our return flights from London Heathrow to Bangkok. The seats were colourful and attractive with plenty of legroom and width. They were laid out in a 2-4-2 formation so we didn't have to clamber over anyone else to get out for the toilet or to stretch our legs. The food was varied and delicious with an attractive menu handed out in advance. Plenty of many films on offer and the staff were friendly and attentive. I would highly recommend this airline and the economy class experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,LHR-BKK. New years eve flight and the crew clearly wished they were celebrating. Was the only down point of the journey - no smiles. But food drinks in flight entertainment and comfort in Economy were all very good! Would fly with Thai again.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,3,no,5,Flew Bangkok Paris direct. Seats while they extended into flat beds were narrow and uncomfortable. Main gripe was the food (and poor wine selection). Lunch was barely okay while dinner was simply inedible: some horrible looking mess of noodles chicken and off-white sauce. My comments to steward were met with a familiar and wry nod. Yes he agreed service and food had declined over the years. Thai simply isn't a premium business class service anymore.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,yes,4,London - Bangkok 4-5 times a year for the past 10 years business class on TG917 and TG916. I am a gold card member and would add that I am 6ft and 20st. My main gripe is that since the A340-600 has been introduced the level of service has gone downhill in my opinion due to the increase in seat capacity but same level of staff. The importance seems to be on serving rolls steward comes round numerous times whereas the wine serving is sparse and never served with the meal which is a shame as it is very palatable especially the white. The Thai lounge is much better than the London lounge. Films can vary a lot but in the main tend to be American. Seating at my weight is never going to be that comfortable. Overall I will still fly Thai but please you need to improve the service at least to how it use to be.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,London to Bangkok. My husband and I travel a lot usually economy and I find economy on Thai one of the best. Boarding went very quick and was well organised. Aircraft was very clean and everything functioning. The food was very good with plenty of soft and alcoholic drinks throughout the flight. Cabin crew helpful smiling and friendly. My husband is quite tall but even he found the seats reasonably comfortable. Entertainment was fine good selection of movies and music. Overall very good experience could not fault on anything and I would definitely recommend.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,Took new A380 from BKK to Tokyo. Long queues at check in and limited self service available. Plane boarding was well organized and executed. New plane is delightful - seat really comfortable with good pitch. IFE touch screen with great selection and very easy to navigate. Food and service good. Really pleasant flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Flight from Mumbai to Hong Kong via Bangkok. Check in at Mumbai was smooth - we got the seats we reserved. Flight out to Bangkok was on an old 747-400. No PTV on board and pretty old aircraft. Flight from BKK-HKG and return much better on A380. Food a bit disappointing on this sector. Return from BKK-BOM was much better with a newer aircraft with PTV's on board. Staff on all sectors were pleasant but not anything exceptional.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,SIN-BKK B777 BKK-KIX A330. I find economy on Thai to be one of the best and have no hesitation in recommending them. Both flights on time crew extremely friendly food was ample and entertainment sufficient. I did notice the B777 SIN-BKK was a little more cramped compared to their long haul offering but I put this down to a shorter route config. The A330 to Osaka was very spacious. Crew are wonderful and requests are carried out with courtesy.
,,,First Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,8,A round trip in First Class HKG-BKK-HKG in very old B747-400 with duo seat window and aisle on inbound flight and return on A380. White cream colour cabin which has already got dirty black marks on it how will it be in few months? True that A380 is a fantastic aircraft even for TG. Large seat and PTV but very limited choice of film. Cabin crew are very good on board and look happy! Fantastic customer service at airport especially in Bangkok. Work on product needed.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,7,This time our flights were between BKK-CEI and vv. on 23/02 (TG130) and 25/02 (TG141) in B/C. The aircraft is rather old and seat reclination is not comfortable. Service is average. Meals were served on B/C for these short flights. The dinner however was a dish of fried shrimp-cake which was cold and bland. In all these flights should be rated as average.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,LHR-BKK return. Outbound service was all smiles from the two ladies servicing our section. Food (beef) was served in the same foil type dish as an economy meal and the quality was about on par with economy - dreadful! A ready meal from a supermarket tastes far better and what does that cost? Makes you wonder who makes cost cutting decisions and whether they factor in the real costs of losing a customer. Return journey I had the lamb which was pretty much inedible. Crew on the way back were poor in our section with no smiles and just seemed to be going through the motions. The seat is angled lie flat which makes it impossible to sleep. Only mild positive really was the IFE with a fairly decent selection of movies and all in their original uncut versions. Basically you get more space but the food is no better than economy. Worth an extra £1300 over the economy ticket - you decide.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,no,5,As a four star airline I was expecting a little better from Thai but my wife and I agree it's not as good as we hoped. We found the seats and leg room much to be desired however generally comfortable. The food was good indeed but not outstanding given Asians food is usually very good. Inflight service was average and below par for a four star airline sorry but not impressed.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,TG949 Madrid to Bangkok. My wife and 3 children aged 7 9 and 13 flew out from Madrid on 23rd Feb. Check in was very quick as was boarding as with the kids we had priority. The plane was a Boeing 777-300R and we flew Economy. The flight left on time and the plane was spotless seats had good leg room and were comfy. The mood lighting made it very nice. The best parts of the flight were the entertainment system - great for all of us and kept the kids occupied through the entire flight. The food was delicious and the drinks included throughout were excellent. I must say that the flight crew service was nothing short of excellent and they made sure our journey was very enjoyable. I have travelled a lot and it is the first time that I'm actually looking forward to travelling back.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,4,yes,7,TG 432 Denpasar to Bangkok on A33O. Check in was quick and I didn't even have to ask for an emergency exit sea. The helpful local agent already realised at 6'3 I would need one. Boarding was by class and seat numbers. Departed on time plenty of drink run's throughout the flight and one crew member apologised for taking 2 minute's to re fill my glass. From what I have read of other airlines I was just grateful she turned up. No in seat entertainment which in this day and for a major airline I found disappointing. Not sure why we were bussed to the terminal as we passed a lot of empty stands. For the right price I would fly with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,Flight numbers we were on were: TG917 LHR-BKK 23/01/13 depart 21.35 arrive 15.55 on 24/01/13. TG725 BKK-HKT 27/01/13 depart 15.35 arrive 16.55. TG204 HKT-BKK depart 10.55 arrive 12.25 on 07/02/13. TG916 BKK-LHR depart 13.30 arrive 19.35 on 07/02/13. Staff both on the ground and on the plane were professional. We travelled economy and although have never been in a position to travel first class felt like we were being treated fairly by staff as nothing was too much trouble. Much appreciated soft drinks were offered on a regular basis throughout the long journey. I suffer with Arthritis in both knees and I had asked my travel agent if this could be mentioned in the event I may need some assistance. When we arrived at BKK there was a member of staff waiting with a wheelchair when I got off the plane. On the return I was in a considerable amount of pain and as soon as we checked in at Phuket to travel via Bangkok back to Heathrow I was asked if I would need assistance which I accepted. The seats we were allocated on the journey back to Heathrow had extra leg room which was much appreciated as I had to put my feet up on pillows on the floor to alleviate the pain.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,6,LHR - BKK return. Managed to sleep approx. 7 hours on the outward flight food and drink adequate but nothing special. Its a shame that the seats do not convert to fully flat but our flight price was reasonable staff and service were good. The return flight was pretty uneventful food and drink quality and availability are just OK (the cheese platter is very poor) staff again helpful and friendly. Sadly Thai are not quite up to the standard they were a few years ago.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Frankfurt - Bangkok - Suratthani. Staff was very friendly and engaged both on ground and in air. A mid-flight extra menu which I asked for (FRA-BKK) came with crackers cheese and fresh fruit of different kind neatly arranged (in economy!) and made up for the unavoidable discomfort of an 11-hours flight.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,3,We fly Thai Airways Business Class every year from Zürich to Sydney. Although I have always loved Thai I was very dissatisfied this time round. The food on the Zürich-Bangkok leg was terrible and on the Bangkok- Sydney leg even worse. The only time we could eat the food was from Sydney to Bangkok. They are obviously saving money! The service also clearly lacked the famous Thai smile!
