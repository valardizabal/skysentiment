✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur,July 2024,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,4,yes,8,"  Fast Check in, Security screening and immigration at BKK airport. Boarding well organized. The B738 was one of the refurbished planes with a free and bright interior. Food decent for this 2h flight. Flight attendants friendly. Just a few blanket available for the 150+ pax on this very cold flight. Overall recommended"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur,July 2024,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,3," I’m travelling with a small child and baby solo, the airline crew was very unhelpful and rude to my family. They refused to let me bring my baby jogger travel pram on the plane despite me having purchased two business class seats. This was my only carry on and they still refused to let me bring it saying there was not space. I had paid for the space with my tickets. I do not recommend using this airline if you have small kids based on my experience."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Auckland to Kuching via Kuala Lumpur,June 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Worst airline ever, requested extra leg room for both flights. Stuffed up both. Seat 28a, 28c on A330-300 and return flight 28c / 28h. They charge people $70 per seat upgrade paid you $280 on my exit row seats. Some how ground staff muck around on both flights and staff don't fix their mistakes."

A333 older aircraft,  touch screen poor. Cabin crew great, food quality improved. KUL to LHR A359 newer aircraft, quiet and crew very good. Food quality very good Champagne Duval Leroy good, other wines could be improved. Kabuli Pulao / Ayam Perchek excellent. MAS has certainly improved. "
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Penang via Kuala Lumpur,July 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," We flew 5 Malaysia Airlines flights in 1 week. Every flight was delayed some by 7 hrs or more. Cabin staff were surly. We booked extra luggage and they dropped it from the return flights and tried charging 700USD to take the amount we had already paid for. They were a good airline, but I will never fly them again."
Not Verified ,Boeing 737 max,Business,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Kuching,June 2024,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"   Good cabin and friendly cabin crew, but limited on entertainment movies. Ground staff very helpful, delicious food "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Heathrow to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur,May 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1, Horrible experience. My flight was cancelled 3 times over 3 different days and on the last day the flight they put me on had a crazy long layover. The service was unacceptable too. Avoid this airline.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Adelaide,May 2024,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2,no,2,"  We’re travelling as a family with my nonverbal autistic son. During checked in, I showed them our GB Pockit pram with a non GB Pockit bag. The check in staff gave us an all okay to use this and can be kept in the overhead cabin as well. Unfortunately the flight attendant on the plane lectured us that it is not acceptable and was telling me that this can be offloaded because it was not safe. I have used the same pram and bag in Singapore Airlines with no problems at all and I made the due diligence to ask in the check in counter as well. What I didn’t like was the manner and attitude of this flight attendant in dealing with us. I don’t want to argue anymore because it’s already stressful traveling with a nonverbal autistic toddler. My husband and I were anxious whole flight it was a traumatic experience and MAS should train their staff on how to deal with passengers with special kids. I was expecting some empathy considering that their check in staff said it’s all good to bring on board. Appalling and disgusting experience overall!"
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok,May 2024,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,5,yes,10,"  Boarding well organized, flight slightly delayed due to heavy air traffic in BKK. Friendly welcome by purser, was addressed by name throughout the flight. New upgraded cabin with comfortable seats and well functioning streaming IFE with an IPad holder where the screen used to be, good choice of movies. The usual good and hearty Malay catering. MH started giving out beer for flights under 3hours. Friendly and efficient staff, highly recommended."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Kuala Lumpur,May 2024,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Fast and efficient checkin, immigration and security services. Boarding well organized, flight uneventful, on time, they even served a snack and water on this 45 min flight; recommended!"
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800NG,Solo Leisure,First Class,Kuala Lumpur to Kuching,April 2024,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,4,yes,7," Ground service was great with seamless self check-in and baggage drop counter, definitely faster than conventional ones. Boarding began 20 minutes prior to departure and the flight departed on-time. The cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. I had the new narrowbody interior without IFE. Instead, wireless IFE was provided called MHStudio. I must admit it was absolutely annoying trying to connect to the WiFi and watch movie without buffers and lag. I only managed to watch the movie 45 minutes into the flight. I was too frustrated and exhausted to watch anything and went to sleep instead. The seat was quite uncomfortably hard and narrow. On the positive side, the lasagna did not disappoint me, although I wished the portion was larger."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Singapore via Kuala Lumpur,May 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5,yes,9,"  Checkin, security check and immigration at BKK airport fast and efficient. The aircraft had been recently refurbished, and looks bright, clean an comfortable. New wifi based entertainment system on own device worked well, with a decent choice of entertainment options. There were 3 meal options on this 2h flight, which was good in quantity and quality. Service was impeccable. Transit in KL was smooth, short flight to Singapore touched down 20 min ahead of schedule. The only negative point was that my high upgrade bid was unsuccessful, despite a half empty business class section. Overall, highly recommended"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur ,April 2024,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,5,yes,10, The flight stewardess (Farra Deyana) was outstanding in her service. She even recognised that I flew in her fight a few days ago from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur. She even remembered the drink I ordered. That shows the wholehearted service by this crew member. I was really impressed with her quality service in both flights.
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur,May 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5,yes,8,  The flight from Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur was smooth. The cabin crew were attentive. The food was good. They installed a new seat with no in-flight display screen but you can use your phone and tablet to watch movies etc after connected to wifi.
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur,March 2024,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,7, Check-in was very smooth. The Marhaba lounge was basic but comfortable. The boarding process for business class passengers was muddly as there was no clear queue. Once onboard the welcome was friendly and I was pleased that there was a vegetarian version of the satay offered to all passengers early in the flight. All the vegetarian food served was of a high quality. Seating was 1-2-2 across the cabin. The pairs of seats by the window were narrower than the others and had less storage space - best to avoid these. Strangely there were no signs to indicate whether the toilets were occupied. The plane operated close to time. Overall a good experience for the price.
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800NG,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Kuching,April 2024,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,1.0,4,yes,6,"  Terrible ground service for connecting flight. The first leg flight landed late due to bad weather, told the cabin crew and ground staff that we have connecting flight in 30 minutes. The cabin crew actually did help by informing the ground staff, however there were no ground staff waiting for us at our arrival gate. We had to ask a ground staff that passes by, but were no good help anyway. We were struggling to follow the airport signage heading to the connecting flight gate, but we made it at least. Fortunately, the connecting flight also delayed due to the weather (by 40 minutes!). The flight itself was great, cabin crew were friendly and the food served was delicious. The seat is quite hard and the IFE is sometime unresponsive. Overall, a mediocre flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800NG,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur,December 2023,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,"  Boarding was efficient and seamless. Got the IFE interior but I was too tired to watch any movies, only open the flight info display and slept most of the flight. The noodle with chicken was surprisingly excellent after having it several times over the years. However, the rest of the meal (bun, fruit, and pudding) was decent at best (could be worse I guess). The cabin crew were very friendly, though they were quite busy as there were VIPs in the flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800NG,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Hong Kong,April 2024,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4,yes,8," The flight was on time and boarding went smoothly. The cabin crews were friendly and provided excellent hospitality. The interior of the flight was new and I like the blue color. The seat was pretty hard and it does not have headrest which is a shame. Legroom were fine for a 5'8 guy despite more seats than the previous interior. USB charging ports are available for each seat, but cannot be used during takeoff and landing. The airline replaced its IFE with MHstudio, which is a web-based streaming platform. You have to use your own device, connect to the inflight WIFI (pretty laggy), and open the website to enjoy the entertainments available. Options were great for movies, TV shows, and music. Unfortunately, there is no flight information visual display. The meal I chose was Salmon Frittata and it was pretty disappointing. The portion of the frittata was about 20% of the whole meal, along with one sausage and potato wedges. The pineapple bun and yogurt was decent. The fruit and salted peanut was the star of the meal."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800NG,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kuching to Kuala Lumpur,April 2024,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,5,yes,8," The flight was delayed for about 30 minutes due to bad weather. Onboard is the old interior with IFE installed. Seat was slightly hard, and the IFE is sort of responsive. The cabin crew were great despite the late evening flight. Once cruising, the crew serves dinner where I chose chicken with rice. The meal was decent, hot rice and nicely cooked chicken, but slightly bland. The marble cake and salted peanut was excellent (as usual). Overall, the flight was decent for the airline's standard."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi,April 2024,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,2,no,1,"  When arriving to destination, I noticed that the clothes in my suitcase were wet. My suitcase has a double zip and is a top brand. I remember the captain telling us in KUL that the flight was delayed due to heavy rain and delays in loading the luggage despite boarding completed. Also initially the flight was delayed by 2 hours. I send a message to Malaysia Airlines with photo of the wet clothes. They answered that they did not find any evidence on their side (meaning I was lying?) and that MA will not pay any compensation, that I never ask for. The only objective of my message was to improve passenger luggage handling. It's not about to happen in the future. So after 2 and half hours delay, we start the flight to Langkawi, and we get a small bag of peanuts and a bottle water."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur,April 2024,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4,yes,6,"  All good, but food wasn't great and no entertainment on this flight. This is poor from Malaysia who are trying to cost cut probably due to pressures from AirAsia."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Auckland to Colombo via Malaysia,April 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2,no,2,"  I recently traveled on Malaysia Airlines from Auckland to Colombo, and I wanted to share my feedback about my experience. The check-in process in Auckland was smooth and efficient, which was appreciated. I had booked and paid for extra legroom seats, but I noticed that many of the front-end extra seats were empty throughout the flight. This was disappointing as I had specifically paid extra for these seats for comfort. Furthermore, there was a problem with the entertainment unit in my seat, as the touch system was not functioning properly. Despite informing the flight attendants about the issue, I was told that it couldn't be fixed. As a result, I requested to move to a different seat with a functioning entertainment system. However, I was informed that there were no seats available, even though I noticed that there were empty seats in the front rows. I also observed a lady with an infant who was seated in front of us. Her mother, who was supposed to be seated in the front row with the infant bassinet, was moving around, leaving the infant unattended. I requested the flight attendant to ask the lady to return to her allocated seat so that we could use the empty seat for a working entertainment system. However, I was informed that they were unable to ask her to move. Overall, I was disappointed with the lack of assistance and the unavailability of the seats despite the circumstances. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Perth,February 2024,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My husband and I passed through Kuala Lumpur Airport on the last day of our honeymoon and had one of the worst days of our lives due to Malaysia Airlines and their terrible transfer desk and staff. Our flight was booked through SriLankan Airlines but the final flight was scheduled to be operated by Malaysia Airlines. At the check in desk in Male, Maldives, the Sri Lanka Airlines representative gave us the boarding passes for our first two flights and informed us we needed to ‘pick up the boarding passes for our third flight at the transfer desk in Colombo or Kuala Lumpur’. The rep did not say we weren’t checked in for this third flight, and confirmed our luggage was also due to make the full journey across the three flights without the need for us to collect or recheck baggage. At the Colombo Airport transfer desk the staff member told us we needed to collect our boarding passes in Kuala Lumpur, which was surprising as this information differed from what the first Sri Lanka Airlines rep told us in Male. Our flight from Colombo to KL landed around 25 minutes late and it then took around 15 minutes to disembark and reach the transfer desk at KLIA. We immediately went to the desk and got there around 7.40am. We spoke to someone on the right side of the desk (separate to the Malaysia Airlines section), and they asked to see our flight itinerary. Given our flight was due to be operated by Malaysia Airlines and the staff member had started serving someone else, we then saw there was a separate transfer desk for Malaysia Airlines. We immediately headed to the long queue at around 7.50am. Although the line was long, we expected it would move at a reasonable pace. After taking turns in the line to use the restroom, when my husband and I were both in the line waiting together we soon realised it was not moving. There was one staff member serving the huge number of passengers and seemingly requiring 10 minutes or more per passenger. We heard others around us talk of their flight time with the two women in front of us saying their flight was prior to ours. Passengers were pushing in the line with disorder in the queue. Many people jumped the line saying they still needed to check in or had children. There was also a very large group being served in one line and they appeared to be at the front of the queue for almost the entire time we were waiting. By the time we finally reached the front of the line around 9am, the staff member rudely spoke to us and told us we missed check in 25 minutes prior. We told her we were waiting over an hour in the queue to which she said she called our names, and she accused us of not being in the queue the entire time.  The staff provided no resolution for us but to rebook our flights, so we proceeded to the gate regardless and again were turned away despite our gate still being open. We were given no option to board our flight. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Amritsar to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur,March 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I booked Asian vegetarian meal both ways however we were offered Hindu veg meal on 2 flights and non veg meal on return flights. Due to that none of us could eat anything excepts some fruits and croissants. Before my return i requested to have my meal changed to jain veg meals so we wont get meat served and on the ticket counter at Amritsar and again at Kuala Lumpur the staff confirmed that our jain meal is confirmed in system however in flight we were served with non veg meals both times . 2) on our arrival to India the whole flight missed their checked baggage's and my family received our baggage's a week after we reached India. In total 7 checked baggage were missing for more than a week before we received them. It had all our clothes, baby food, nappies etc. I had to buy  everything including clothes (had wedding to attend) . We did not had anything with us as the aircraft from Kuala Lumpur to Amritsar was too small that staff had to put out carry bags with checked in luggage. Myself and my kids went out of airport with no jacket. Kuala Lumpur-Amritsar staff was very rude to all the passengers. As it was a very small plane there were no bassinets. Having a baby on lap i was unable to open the flap to keep the food tray and requested crew if i could sit at different seat as there were few lines which were totally empty for dinner as it will be easier for me to eat and keep my 1 year old baby on other seat. The crew bluntly refused and told me i am only allowed to use the seat i paid for. The solution i was offered was that my wife can eat whatever she could eat out of her plate while i hold the baby and then she can hold the child so that i can open the flap to put my tray and eat. When the meal was served (Hindu meal with chicken in it) out of it we could only eat fruits and dessert. For the above issues i put a complaint and filled feedback form which airline sent me but never heard anything back. For my return flight Amritsar to Kuala Lumpur i booked my seats in advance and paid for it so i don't have to go through the same. When i got my boarding pass the seats were different. When i requested to have the seat i paid for staff at airport could not do as they have already given those seats to someone else. So we had to suffer the same thing but at least crew was very accommodating except they could not find us any veg meal. On our return flight from Kuala Lumpur to Sydney was cancelled and we were given new boarding passes as we came out of the flight from Amritsar to Kuala Lumpur. They also provided us with breakfast vouchers, hotel. In my new boarding pass we didn’t receive bassinet as it was confirmed in my flight ticket. I approached transfer counter to confirm if we still have bassinet. the staff told me we don't have it and i need to pay for it. I had to beg the staff to give bassinet as its not our fault that flight is been cancelled. Finally after some time they decided to provide my wife with bassinet but we had to sit in different compartments now. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne,April 2023,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,"  Overall, the flight was great with very friendly and nice crews on both my return flights. There was once when we flew over the Indonesian airspace and the turbulence was quite bad and felt like dying, the crews were very attentive and look out for me a lot. I am seriously very touched about it. Entertainment wise was alright, they have some blockbuster movies, overall it was okay. During my 8 hours flight, I was given 1 hot meal, 1 snack such as pastry or sandwiches and also the famous MAS peanuts. The food option was great as well. The cabin cleanliness was good especially the toilet. I was also given blanket and pillow during the flight."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur,September 2023,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,no,1,"  Very bad customer service. Entertainment was not working, they gave us 25% to use with in 6 months which is unfair. Very slow answering the requests, and the food is bad."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Kuala Lumpur to Auckland,March 2024,1.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3,no,5,"  Flight left on time and arrived on time. Food and drink was terrific and customer service was excellent. Perfect brewed Coffee - best I have ever had on an airplane. Why do they not advertise alcohol? If you ask you get! Asked and they had Beer, Wine, Spirits and Champagne. Business Class seats are old fashioned style, not luxurious and basic in design. Lie flat bed was very uncomfortable. Seats were worn out and looked like they badly needed a refresh / upgrade. There was no Onboard Wi-Fi or Internet over the whole 10 hour flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur,March 2024,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3,no,5,"  Short flight just under 2 hours. Only 3 rows of business class seats (4 seats across in 2 x 2) My wife and I were in 2 D & F. We were offered a choice of 3 main meals, requested our choice and were then told none left. How can the 1st row and the last row get served first and the middle row left to last! No TV, No Audio (must bring your own!)"
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Auckland to Chennai via Kuala Lumpur,January 2024,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1," I booked two tickets for my mother and my sister to travel from Chennai to New Zealand. They came to NZ without any problem, however, there was no wheel chair assistance given. When going back i called Malaysia Airlines to ask them to cancel my sisters ticket and keep my mothers ticket as it is because only she will be travelling and i made sure i booked a flexi ticket so i can cancel anytime. When i spoke to the agent she said she has cancelled the ticket for my sister and had my mums kept as it is. But two days before my mothers travel i went online to check the ticket i found that her ticket was kept on hold. So i called the Airlines and they said its been cancelled. I asked them why and they said I requested it to be cancelled. After a day of fight with them and language barrier of them not understanding English properly they found out that its was the 1st agents mistake as she cancelled both the ticket instead. So, i had to rebook the ticket just one day before the travel which was so expensive. And my mother couldn't be in NZ as she was in visitor visa and had to leave the country in a day. Now the airlines knows that its their mistake and took the complaint but they are not refunding the excess money i paid because of the last minute tickets which would be close to $700 to $800 NZD. Its been three months now and they said they will get back in 40 days which was in the beginning of January to be exact 4th of January. We would have made numerous number of calls to the airline and no one are able to give a proper answer and they kept saying their manager would call back which has not happened till now."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Kuala Lumpur,February 2024,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,1.0,5,no,4,"  No boarding pass issued after online check in. Itinerary does not use proper English or Philippines abbreviations baggage limits. Waste of time on this airline and needed to haul baggage down stairs to gate. Gate at Manila Airport was extremely hot without air conditioning in February. The manager screamed and said it was not her job to provide customer support. No snacks, beverages or water at the gate even if it’s delayed."
Not Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Kuala Lumpur,January 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Great flight. Choice of lounges at Heathrow - Gulf Air or Qatar. We chose Qatar Airways lounge and although very busy enjoyed a lovely expresso martini at the cocktail area. Boarding was on time and we were greeted by very friendly cabin crew and shown to our seats. I had selected 4A and 6A as they offer more privacy. Welcome drinks were offered and then shortly after take off the famous satay snack offering. Flight was very comfortable but what really stood out for me was the exemplary cabin crew - courteous, smiling, engaging probably the best cabin crew I have encountered in my travels. Used the complimentary wi-fi which was excellent. Catering offered Malay and European dishes along with nice drinks selection. The only let down for me was the IFE film selection, not many new movies and a lot of children's movies. Despite the IFE issue I would 100% fly this airline again. Our return flight and several domestic flights were also excellent."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Kuala Lumpur to Incheon,March 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I had a flight at 23:15 on March 3, but it was delayed 5 and a half hours to 4:45 am in the morning. As a result, I had to miss my Monday morning meeting and felt groggy all day. They did not provide a re-routing flight or offer a hotel in the terminal where I can rest. I had to stay in a noisy, smelly, and crowded Golden Lounge for 7 hours of waiting with screaming kids and loud guests - the worst business lounge in the world. There was only one staff handling hundreds of angry customers and from 22:21, I had to wait very long before I could ask for a re-routing flight with Korean Air at 23:50. By then, it was too late and the flight was full.  The staff was rude and unhelpful. This is the third time in my last trip that the flight has been delayed for 5 hours. It is impossible to schedule meetings since the management is totally incompetent and they do not have enough planes to cover all their routes."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Perth,February 2024,,,,,,1.0,3,no,1,  Flight delayed with no communication on how long and now stuck in this hot box of a waiting area. Service has been sub standard the whole time. Flight here was equally as woeful with poor food and waking people up at 3am. Seems like Malaysian hospitality no longer means much. No preferential treatment for one world status which seems to be a dishonor of being a part of the group. Would not fly again by choice.
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Kuala Lumpur,January 2024,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,5,yes,9,"  This my second time flying with Malaysian Airlines since the Covid. Their services have certainly improved. I found them to be more attentive and responsive than prior to Covid. Food, is as usual, more than sufficient and tasty. Considering that they have to handle a crowded plane, I must commend them for their patience and efficiency. All in all, they deserved to be commended for their improved services. My only criticism is that their widely advertised Free Wifi is dysfunctional, or non-existent."
Not Verified ,A330-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Kuala Lumpur via Mandurah,February 2024,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Just absolutely rubbish, cancelled flight with no information provided. Unfriendly staff who don't make any effort to help you. Come back the next day after the cancelled flight to find myself sitting in the aircraft because of technical difficulties. Waiting for that one to be cancelled now. Obviously unsafe aircraft if they are having technical difficulties all the times."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to Perth,February 2024,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1,no,1, I had two flights to get from Hanoi to Perth. The first flight from Hanoi to KL. was cancelled due to technical issues. I was rebooked 24 hours later. Eventually made it to KL to have the second leg cancelled due to technical difficulties. Another overnight delay. Hotels were provided but only after very long waits and not well organised. I wonder if they have any planes that don’t have technical problems as I certainly didn’t get one.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok,February 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Terrible, delayed due to bag offload and no air-conditioning on plane, like sauna. Terrible experience and shame as a country have such airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Sydney,February 2024,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2,no,3,"  Bad quality food, fruit salad served not ripe and unfit for consumption. Cabin staff reluctant to serve hot drinks on an 8-hour flight, use the seat belt sign ON as an excuse, even when there is no turbulence. I have not flown on a flight with the seat belt sign ON unnecessarily by the captain for 6 out of 8 hours, when there was turbulence only for a limited time 30 minutes.  It happened on the outbound flight too SYD-KUL they used the same tactic seat bet sign ON and no hot drinks served and I gave them the benefit of the doubt.  Forced to accept rice breakfast on passengers which we are not used to with no other choice. We were seated in the front section of the cabin and the attitude was take it or leave it.  Wine was served in a leaky plastic cup, when requested for another glass, they just added another cup below the leaky cup. How do you drink wine with 2 cups?  Old entertainment system small selection of movies, the Captain and cabin staff have no concerns about damage to ears with announcements through the headphones which happens unnoticed."

✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Bangkok via Kuala Lumpur,December 2023,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,9,"  I had a real smooth flight with Malaysia airlines. The food is excellent and the cabin crew are very friendly. I had a slight annoyance prior to departure which I wanted to mention. Malaysia Airlines has a programme where you can bid for an upgraded seat which I decided to do and I wish I never did. You find out 24hours before whether you have been successful. However it meant that I couldn’t check in on the website prior to departure. I like to have an aisle seat, so I make sure I check in. I couldn’t do that and I ended up with a middle seat. Which I was annoyed at, but overall the flight was still fine. I had a two hour delay connecting onward to Bangkok. Still I find them a fantastic airline."

The counter staff was not accommodating and made me run in a circle and did not assist in any way, they were rude, blunt even the manager. She was very demanding and raised her voice. I felt threatened as a passenger would not recommend flying. It’s not a first class or four-star airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Tokyo via Kuala Lumpur,January 2024,2.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," I am a photographer traveling to Melbourne, and the airline informed me that I cannot carry my camera gear as carry-on because it is overweight. They suggested I purchase an additional checked bag, but they asked for payment based on weight, amounting to 400 AUD. This is more expensive than buying a new ticket, which is what I ended up doing in the end. I understand there are additional charges but basing it on weight when it is less than a 23kg additional checked luggage is ridiculous!"

The seat was good, padding was soft and for less than one hour flight it was very confortable. Not sure for much longer flight. The crew was efficient, warm and welcoming. Satay and cold beverages were served for this short flight which was very good. The departure was a little bit behind schedule due to the congestion at KLIA and obviously not the airlines fault. Its not a 5 star service BUT definitely 4 or 4.5 star. Very high customer value for the price paid."

The seats are comfy, food was tasty and staff very friendly. My first flight was a two hour flight from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur. Fine no problems for a two hour hop. The flight from KUL to Heathrow was just short of 14 hours. Initially I thought I was going to really struggle with the length of this flight. However I had no issues and it didn’t drag at all. What is very handy is having access to all your messaging apps. That is brilliant and you can waste a few hours talking to friends or family. I was extremely impressed all round. I will happily fly with them again."

Check-in was busy but OK. Marhaba lounge was basic. Boarding was delayed and take off a little bit late. The crew in my cabin were excellent, very engaging and proactive. Announcements onboard were the clearest I have ever heard on a flight. Food choices were not too appealing except for the satay. Drinks and snacks were offered throughout the flight. No Wi-Fi. IFE could be improved both in content and operation. For some reason MAS tends to leave the seat belt sign on for extended periods way after any turbulence is felt. I have noticed this on many of their flights. Luggage arrived promptly. Overall pretty good Malaysian hospitality."

The Sydney international airport staff were unhelpful, no communication and the checkin process was absolutely terrible. The flight was delayed by 9 hours. Reached KL, the transit staff said the hotel was 1 hour away from the airport which was provisioned for the passengers on this delayed flight. Upon returning, in Kathmandu flight delayed..again no communication. Paid for a lounge and came to the gate as expected however got stuck at the gate with the delayed flight.

First trip was on December 26th, all the way through the day it was postponements after postpones. Even leaving there was a delay. It meant I was at the airport far longer than. When arriving at my destination my bags were lost. My first 3 days on my cruise I had to stay in my room as all my clothes were lost. The cruise didn't have clothes that fit me so I had to wait till we dokc for me to pick up my luggage. The trip back on Jan 5 was a horrible experience. I am a big lad and the seats are a lot smaller than other airlines I had. The food was so bad I gave it back uneaten and just had the water.

Unfortunately, I left my hand carry suitcase at the gate before boarding the flight from KL to Denpasar-Bali. As soon as the mistake was realised, I informed the cabin crew, but the plane had already started pushing back. The crew was extremely friendly and assured me that I would be getting the suitcase back, and that they had contacted ground staff at KLIA. However after landing in Bali. I went to the lost and found at Denpasar airport in Bali, where the person had no idea how to contact anyone at KL or Malaysia Airlines to inquire about the luggage I left. I was told to fill out a form, which I did. (Looking back now if I had done nothing else other than fill out the form, I would never have gotten any information about my suitcase.) Throughout the next few days I repeatedly called Malaysia Airlines numbers, and none of them ever picked up. I was by the phone for hours at a time. Finally, one number picked up, but I was told the person had no idea what to do about my suitcase, and that it wasn't at Malaysia Airlines' lost and found at KL. After numerous calls, I finally got a hold of another person who directed me to AeroDarat, and said that my suitcase might be at their lost and found. The earlier person could have told me that there was more than one lost and found, and that I should call the other ones to check, but didn't. Thank god I found out about the other lost and found.  Once i got aerodarat's number, Aerodarat didnt pick up numerous times, but once they finally did i found out my luggage was indeed with them. They said i could get it when i transited at KL again on the way back to Kathmandu. Howver, when i was at KL again the person at the help desk said the Aerodarat lost and found was beyond immigration. As we didn't have a visa to enter Malaysia, I told the person i couldn't go past immigration to retrieve my case, to which the person kept responding that i should still go. Then they said they couldnt do anything beyond that. Another lady at the help desk also couldn't do anything, and even got mad at us. Finally, a man came and understood that we couldn't cross immigration, so he said our suitcase would be brought to us at the gate before our next flight. Finally, I got my case back at the gate. I never got ANY email or anything acknowledging that i had filled out the form which the staff told me to fill out. If not for my constant calling, i would never have retrieved my suitcase. the form was completely useless. This experience was unfortunate, as the cabin crew and in flight service was splendid. However, like I said Malaysia Airlines needs to change up it's ground service and lost and found services thoroughly. I will not be flying with Malaysia Airlines again."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Chennai via Kuala Lumpur ,January 2024,,,,,,,1,no,2,"  I have been flying through Malaysia Airlines for a while but after this incident may have to reconsider. After booking tickets we checked with the customer service personnel to add in more baggage allowance. The Airline customer service personnel advised that to add in 10 Kg it costs only $15AUD more. However, there is an additional penalty of $150 AUD to modify them. It is a shame to rip off its customers with an additional $150AUD charge for such a small change request. This Airlines will not be our preferred Airline for travelling from next time onwards."

A simple travel route from Osaka to Singapore should be less than 7 hours. Instead, 24 hours later I’m still stuck in KL airport. First flight from Osaka to Kuala Lumpur was diverted to Ho Chi Min due to engine issue. The ground staff was messy and disorganized, took very long to get things sorted. They booked a bunch of passengers on connecting flights that there’s no way we can make it in time, especially when the flight from Vietnam to Kuala Lumpur was delayed because they took very long to sort out all the passengers. Passengers with different final destinations all realized we missed our flight upon landing and were forced to stay overnight in KL. The transport arranged by the airline didn’t turn up to pick us up from the hotel to the airport in morning. Avoid this airline!"

Last leg with Malaysia Airlines. Not sure who came up with this codeshare partnership but it's half baked. You get an email to check in on the TK site but they don't give you the TK ticket number and PNR. And of course their link does not work. Once you have that - through the TK customer service line you will find out that you still can't reserve a seat or check in online - explanation - because it's a code share. How stupid is that? And wee had a 2 hour delay in KUL to top it all off.

✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Kuala Lumpur,December 2023,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,4.0,4,yes,8,"  Smooth journey on both intercontinental legs and a couple of domestic flights in between. All flights on time, and requested seats honoured on all. Seats supportive and comfortable for price. Food decent portions and quite tasty for an econ offering. Alcohol seems limited to beer or wine in econ, but no problem asking for refills, plus soft drinks readily available. Staff very courteous. Baggage reclaim was prompt, even at LHR on return. Since the demise of the B747s and A380s on this route, load factors are high, and as with B787s, the A350 seems cramped and poky , but I understand the need for utiliising more efficient planes. Overall a recommended journey, and, being direct, saves the hassle of changing planes in the middle east."

The ground staff at the various airports were also very helpful. I am a nervous flyer, but thanks to Malaysian Airlines, my trips were not stressful at all as I felt cared for throughout. Our take offs and landings were so smooth so I had no cause for concern throughout the journeys. Thank you Malaysian Airlines!"

The connecting flight got missed and they said they will arrange to next flight, which is at night. They took our passports to arrange special pass and they came back with the pass after 5:30 hours. After 5:30 they came up and took another 2 hours for passes and transportation. They didn’t even provide a meal.  After all the wait we reached the hotel and stayed for 1 hr and they started us to go back to airport. After all the hassle in flight I have requested for hindu vegetarian meal and they didn’t change it in the new flight and they didn’t bother to apologise nor provide any alternative. They didn’t even have anything to provide food in flight. There said there was no option for veg and no food provided. After all these things my check in bag got missing and they couldn’t even locate my bag, I don’t how come they can’t locate a bag. Never flying tem again nor recommended. Such a nightmare."

If they delay or cancel your flight they take no responsibility their response was “that’s what you get insurance for”. Lucky for us we always buy insurance but come on, take some accountability! When we call customer service because no one can seem to help us at the airports about upgrading on the way back, you get put on hold for extended periods of time, so long that it eventually just drops your call while you’re waiting. Told by the manager themselves that they would call back in 5mins and no call over 1.5 hours later. After 5 hours of going back and forth and no manager returning our calls, we are told we can only upgrade the entire trip and not parts of it. Extremely frustrating to hear when you were told the complete opposite on the way to our destination. Phone then drops out again and you can’t upgrade on their website. Ended up just cancelling our flights and booking flights with another company we were that disgusted with their lack of appropriate service. Will never book with them again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur,November 2023,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,5.0,3,no,1,"  This is the first time I had a very bad experience with Malaysia airlines, I have bought a round-trip ticket to fly back Malaysia from Melbourne. However, I have made some changes few days before with the call center to postponed my return flight back to Melbourne as I wish to extend my stay in Malaysia. On the 25 Nov which I should fly with MH128 at 00.30am from Melbourne to Malaysia and found out there is an issue with my ticket when I checked in at the counter as there is no ticket number can be found in the system. The lady at the counter  told me that she couldn’t fix it as there is no ticket found and she suspect they must have messed up my ticket when they changed my return flight so she made me to call the Malaysia airlines on the spot to help to fix the problem. Finally get through the call centre after 15 minutes, it is very disappointing that they fixed it but putting me into the wrong flight - MH148 (which is the flight that fly off the next day) and she hung me up after that without calling me back to fix the error. I was lucky enough as there are 2 counter ladies tried what they can to help me out. I’m not too sure how they fix it but at least now they can find my name in the system so they could get an approval from the back station to do something for me so that I could fly with MH128 which is the flight I initially booked. I am making this complain to hope Malaysia airlines is aware so they can improve in the future."

The flight was delayed by an hour and we did receive an email to warn us about this. The departure time was 0220 but the aircraft was finally airborne at 0400! The boarding process was not well managed and there was little enforcement of hand luggage. There were a lot or travellers who were heading to India and Nepal and they seemed to have lots of hand luggage and there was insufficient space in the overhead bins. This is where things get weird. Once airborne at 4am, you would think they would give everyone a drink and a bag of peanuts and then turn off the lights and let the passengers sleep and then serve them breakfast before landing. But no, we were served a hot meal of either chicken curry or beef stew! By the time the meal service was over, there was about only 3.5 hours of flying time left to rest! The cabin crew were not warm and we had a surly male flight attendant serving us. The IFE was limited and not all seats had headphones or blankets so a lot of people were asking for them. All in all, MH could do a lot better. They make a big deal of Malaysian hospitality on the plane but that was probably reserved for the premium class up front."

The boarding was well-organized, and the cabin crew welcomed passengers with the characteristic warmth that Malaysia Airlines is known for. Seating arrangements were comfortable, providing a decent level of comfort for the relatively short flight. The in-flight entertainment options were varied (but I don't use inflight entertainment because I have downloaded movie content on my mobile phone). The in-flight dining experience, while not groundbreaking, met the expectations of a standard domestic flight. Being someone with dietary restrictions, I was pleasantly surprised by the superb gluten-free dining experience. The flight itself proceeded without any significant issues, and the punctuality of arrival in Kuala Lumpur allowed for a smooth transition for passengers connecting to their next destinations. For those seeking a straightforward journey with reliable service, Malaysia Airlines continues to be a solid choice for domestic travel within Malaysia."

Check-in procedures were smooth, with attentive ground staff ensuring a hassle-free start to the travel experience. The boarding process was well-organized, and the cabin crew welcomed passengers with the warmth and professionalism that Malaysia Airlines is known for. Seating arrangements were comfortable, providing adequate legroom for the duration of the flight. The in-flight entertainment system offered a variety of options to suit diverse tastes, making the journey enjoyable for those who sought entertainment during the flight. The in-flight dining experience was modest, with a menu that featured local flavors. While not necessarily groundbreaking, the meals were satisfying, and the cabin crew ensured that passengers were well taken care of throughout the flight. The flight itself proceeded with significant delays, and the arrival in Kuching was a bit late. Overall, my experience on the usual route to Kuching with Malaysia Airlines was standard in the best sense of the word. The airline's commitment to providing a reliable and comfortable travel experience was evident, making it a solid choice for those looking for a straightforward journey without any major surprises."

I recently had the pleasure of flying with Malaysia Airlines post the reported catering issue, and I'm thrilled to announce that the airline has made a triumphant comeback in the realm of in-flight dining. The previous concerns seem to be a distant memory as the culinary experience on my recent flight was nothing short of spectacular. Malaysia Airlines has not only resolved the catering issue but has taken this opportunity to elevate its food offerings to new heights. From the moment I made my dietary request, the attention to detail was evident. Malaysia Airlines went above and beyond to ensure that my gluten-free meal was not only safe but also delicious. The cabin crew played a crucial role in making the experience seamless. Their understanding of dietary restrictions and willingness to accommodate special requests was commendable. It was clear that Malaysia Airlines places a high priority on passenger comfort and satisfaction, regardless of dietary preferences. Choosing not to utilize the in-flight entertainment and Wi-Fi, I experienced a journey marked by tranquility and the simple joy of being unplugged. Overall satisfied."

My partner is partially sighted and MH were very courteous and helped us a lot. Sure the AVOD selection is rather basic and the A333s are old but the service, legroom, food, and overall experience bar the entertainment were on a par with SQ who I flew with last year and vastly superior to LH on the same trip.

When I land in KL on the 19th of Oct, what was a 2hr layover, has become a 17 hour layover. No compensation, no offer to put us up in a hotel or into another carrier, the customer, must wear this. Why? Engineering issues. 2 weeks out. Reality not enough seats sold. Trying to communicate with the transit hotel is pure pain.  So no flight leaves KUL for Bangkok after 16:00, until 09:00 the next day. So the wife and i forced to stay in the transit hotel at a stupid cost, because MH put it's budget before customer service. No one in their right mind would choose this lay over, unless the ticket was dirt cheap. When i spoke to MAmH contact centre, they were fine with the 2 week notice, as they deemed it not short notice. My response.

We fly a lot and recommend avoiding Malaysia Airlines at all costs. They have reduced the seat spacing to the ridiculous and more importantly they do not care. Seeing row after row of passengers sitting bolt upright (with seats supposedly reclined) trying to watch a movie on a screen which is just inches from their face beggars belief. One needing the restroom requires all in the row leaving their seats (with a high degree of difficulty, yanking on the seats in front) to let others out. Mealtimes a joke, as even seeing the tray is difficult with it being so close to your body let alone getting the food up to your mouth. In addition MH feel justified seating couples apart even when they booked together and more to the point, are  dismissive of any pleas to sit together. We had two 11 hr flights putting up with these conditions. Arrogance and indifference are the norm with this lot."

The flight started with a late departure, over an hour late with no real reason. During the flight free wifi cards were handed out. However, the WiFi was not working. bit of a waste of paper.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Dhaka via Kuala Lumpur,October 2023,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,2.0,2,no,3,"   Malaysia Airlines has been our go to airlines for the past 10 years because the price was reasonable, the meals were great and the service was good over all. However, I am seeing the decline of the service over time and the last experience is like a nail in the coffin. The experience started with poor instructions in the boarding gate, people were confused and cluttered around the entrance. 30 minutes of late boarding was followed by another 30 minutes stranding in the runway. Everyone was seated and with ready to go by had no idea why the plane was not moving. After 30 minutes the pilot realised he needs to explain and then gave an announcement about the take off queue. Once the flight took off, they served 3 small pieces of vegetable balls as dinner. Thankfully the breakfast served in the morning was standard (scrambled eggs, butter, bread, fruit, etc). We landed safely in KL for stop over. The flight from KL was delayed because Malaysian airlines could not solve an issue they were having with their catering and had to delay an international flight by an hour. Boarding was no better than before, they were calling in groups by i figured whoever by passed the queue, they allowed them to onboard first. This time meal was chickpeas in lentil, white rice and one piece of carrot as lunch.  Given the airlines are charging 50% more than pre-covid, it is expected that they at least maintain similar decent standard. But the overall experience of my flight was very sub standard to say the least. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Taipei,September 2023,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1,no,2,"  I am writing to express my utmost disappointment in the quality of service provided by Malaysia Airlines, an airline I have frequently patronized in the past. Regrettably, my recent experiences have led me to conclude that the airline has regressed significantly, to the extent that I consider it the worst airline I have ever traveled with. It has come to my attention that Malaysia Airlines' website and mobile app consistently display inaccurate pricing for various services. This not only raises questions about the airline's transparency but also creates an environment that appears designed to deceive customers and extract more funds from them. My attempts to seek clarification and resolution through email channels have proven futile, as I have received no response from the customer service team. In contrast to the silent email responses, my interactions with the call center agents have been far from satisfactory. The unprofessional and unhelpful conduct exhibited during these exchanges only compounds my concerns. My suspicion that the airline is deliberately misleading customers deepens as I observe irregularities in the pricing display of additional services. The functionality of the website is fraught with issues, further exacerbating the overall negative experience. Navigating the site has become an arduous task, detracting from the convenience one should expect. The quality of in-flight meal replacements has reached a level I can only describe as abysmal. The deterioration in food quality reflects poorly on the airline and its commitment to passenger satisfaction.  My experience with flight attendants has left much to be desired, particularly in relation to the distribution of basic amenities such as blankets and headphones. Such lapses in service standards are inexcusable. "

My business flight had been booked for weeks and I had meetings organised soon after arriving. But on the way to the airport I received a curt text informing me that the flight was cancelled and if been placed in a flight 4 hours later! Such arrogance. I run a massively customer facing organisation and under no circumstances would we casually disrupt our customers' plans. No explanation, chaos at the airport, ground staff heroically managing the mass of rescheduled travellers. Does Malaysian Air imagine that they have a monopoly on this route? If so, they're about to receive an awakening. No further business from me, my company or hopefully, none of my friends."

I am a person who is not too concerned about the services but this experience needs to be taken into account by the management. This review focuses on my Kota Kinabalu (BKI) to Kuala Lumpur (KUL) route. Punctuality: Retime for 1 hour later, but take-off about 1 hour and a half. The good side of this, they kept e-mailed me on the retime earlier as I needed to make sure my first leg flight was on time and plan my transfer from 1st flight to this flight (including check-in as I was not allowed to check-in online) Boarding Experience: As the boarding gate is shared with another airline, the boarding queue seems unorganized as the space for queuing is small. Basic Comfort: While the seating and cabin amenities are modest, they are adequate for shorter flights. The seating is functional, and there's sufficient legroom for a comfortable journey. Old aircraft but it was okay for me. In-Flight Service: Normal in-flight experience. Snacks and beverages (hot meals) are available but understand the situation faced by this airline. Cabin crew: Normally I give 5 stars to the crew, but on this flight their performance was modest."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Medan to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur,September 2023,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2,no,1,"  On the 10th Sept 2023, I and my wife is going to return to Australia from Medan, Indonesia. We check in Kualanamu Airport, producing our flight booking reference. Initially I and my wife are on the same booking number, but due to death in our family my wife have to travel a couple days earlier to be able to attend the funeral. So my wife have to pay penalty for change of date of travel to Indonesia and she was given another booking reference. During the change of date the Malaysian Customer support assured us that our date of return to Australia from Medan will be the same / no change, that is on the 10th Sept 2023. But when we check in to the Malaysian Airlines counter, the staff told us that they can not find our name in their system, therefore they will not check us in. We protest and produce the print out (hard copy) of our booking 6JMMSH and 6Q3LSE. They took the copy and check their system again. And again they told us that they can not find our names and bookings in their system. I cannot believe this. Here we are, producing the hardcopy of our bookings, and payments and they said they can not find our in their system. We told them to look hard and find out from their bosses. But the manager said they are sorry they can not help us. Then they refer us to their higher bosses in Kualanamu Airport, and this boss said the same thing that they can not help us. They told us to ring Malaysian Airlines.  In the airport we do not have the Malaysian Airlines number, we do not have the contact number, and we should not have to do all of this, the Malaysian check in staff should find out all about this. I tried to ring my daughter in Australia by whatsapp and managed to find her. I told her the problem and send her the bookings reference number of our flight. She looks into the Malaysian Airlines website and put in our flight number. And our names are there to fly on that date which is the 10th Sept 2023. She sent this information to our phones and we showed this to Malaysian Airlines staff. Yet they still said that they cannot find our names in the system. We are so mad and disappointed. The thinking that we may missed the flight is frightened us. Yet the Malaysian Airlines staff at Kualanamu keep saying they can not help us. We ring our daughter in Australia asking her to ring Malaysian Airlines Customer Support. In the mean time we are the only two persons left in the counter, because everyone else already boarding. After a long wait finally my daughter get in contact with the Customer support which said they will look in the system and investigate. Another long wait, and the plane take off time is getting closer. We are so depressed and thinking about the potential losses of money if we can not get the flight. My daughter from Australia tried to speak the Malaysian Airlines staff to explain what they find out from Malaysian airlines website, but the staff said they cannot hear my daughter. After a while, while we are thinking about what to do with this situation, the Malaysian Airlines staff told us that now they find our names in the system. And that now we can check in."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi to Penang via Kuala Lumpur KLIA,September 2023,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,4.0,4,yes,7," Check in was fast, and on both legs boarding by row number was enforced and therefore efficient and fast. The seat on the international leg was comfortable, and a tasty hot meal and soft beverages were served. The flight operated on time. On the domestic leg seats were a bit tighter. Nuts and water were served. While boarding was orderly, people were allowed to bring on huge amounts of carry-on baggage, resulting in bewildered passengers struggling through the cabin looking for storage. Transit at KLIA was a grim experience, due to long and poorly organised immigration queues with a hour's waiting, and a dark domestic departures area with low ceilings and very few coffee and food outlets. There is free wifi, though. Apart from having to transit through KLIA, the journey with Malaysian was a good experience."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Doha to Kuala Lumpur ,September 2023,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,4," I had no choice but to fly Malaysia Airlines because they partnered with Qatar Airways. My flight was the last leg from Doha to Kuala Lumpur, almost an 8-hour flight. The plane was old, my seat couldn't recline, and the bathroom was held together with duct tape. But at least the plane didn't rattle like the flight that I was also forced to take - with Malaysian Airlines last year. The flight attendants that attended our section lack finesse and class, in my opinion. First, boarding was a surprise for me as they announced business class and families with children and then after that everyone else instead of rows or zones. Chaos ensued as the crowd rushed and there was only one lady checking the boarding passes! Upon boarding, a flight attendant in the back was yelling out instructions to her colleague in the front. And unfortunately it happened right when I was squeezing past her and my ear was near her mouth. Then I witnessed another one eagerly, over-politely showing a young able-bodied Caucasian couple to their seats. They clearly did not need her assistance as they were already loading their cabin baggage in the overhead compartment. This was not a real problem except that it's a pet peeve of mine when white people are treated differently and her tone of voice changes when speaking to people like myself. I don't know whether it was my luck I got a crass crew but while serving meals, they announced the options to one row and to the next row they only asked loudly ""And you guys? What do you want?"" After serving refreshments they were collecting rubbish and they did this by walking down the aisle yelling ""CUPS! RUBBISH! CUPS! CUPS! RUBBISH!"" And before landing they walked down the aisle in the same fashion, this time yelling ""SEATBELTS! SEATBELTS! SEATBELTS!"" I almost burst out laughing because of the irony when near the end of the flight there was a totally pointless video that interrupted my movie with a punchline ""THIS is Malaysian hospitality."" I was also a bit embarrassed because I am Malaysian and the level of hospitality of the crew was below par compared to the other airlines I've flown with, including budget airlines."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Kuala Lumpur,September 2023,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1,no,3,"  I am a Malaysia Airlines Enrich member and used to travel a lot once I was an Enrich Gold member, due to COVID and no connection and reduced flights, could not travel with Malaysia Airlines as a result they dropped my status to basic blue members. I recently flew with Malaysia Airlines to KL and it is now chasing the budget Airasia model to sustain. Right from the time you search on their flight pricing, they offer bait flights with 7 KG handbag and then you need to add various services with additional prices such as check bag of 20 kg or 30 Kg options, then seat selection, if you want to sit in front of cabin additional fees etc. I am surprised by how a low type mentality people at the top end thinks and try to compete with budget airline and their pricing instead of leading the pack with a good level of service. Checking at Sydney there are only 3 open counters one dedicated to business class so economy passengers have to wait in queue for more than an hour to get checked because they don't have people to check them in. Flights get delayed as passengers still checked in just 40 minutes before departure. Inflight music is so uncomfortable to the ears that you wish there was no music. They announced by email that there was a change in Catering service, so we should expect a change in food expectations, but did not expect that they serve meals in paper boxes instead of plastic trays, placing bread rolls and butter on table which every one knows that how unhygienic that table is. The quantity of food has reduced to just a few morsels and items like salad and decent dessert are missing replaced with 2-inch x 2-inch slices of banana bread. After the meal service and the boxes were taken away they served us wine and drinks and thereafter another person came and dropped peanut bags. When questioning staff why you serve meal first, wine thereafter and peanut last. I have been told this is how standard or Practice is advised by the management. Apparently, it looks like someone is running the airline and inflight experience by the people who do not have any experience or knowledge. On the whole 8-hour flight, the inflight cabin was lit and lights on as a result we could not get sleep. Aircraft are run down, toilets are wet, and smelly, and paper rolls are missing in the toilet. For the inflight crew on the way to KL, I had a great crew with smiles on their face, but when returning from KL the crew were grumpy and had no initiative to serve. I wonder if this attitude of airlines is going to continue for another year or two then certainly this is the major downfall of MH from high on a pedestal to the floor in the long run."

Not Verified ,A330-300,Family Leisure,Business Class,Delhi to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur,September 2023,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  First and likely last time flying Malaysia Airlines. Albeit expectations weren’t that high, I was looking forward to flying Malaysia Airlines for the first time. Check-in at Delhi airport opened a little over 4 hours before scheduled departure time which meant that I could clear customs and security at Delhi airport fairly quickly. Traveling in business class, I received a ticket to the newly opened Encore Prive lounge at Delhi airport. Food and drinks were excellent. Boarding was chaotic but quick.  After boarding, we waited for an additional 30 minutes for 4 missing passengers. Eventually doors closed, the aircraft was pushed back and we  stood on a taxiway for another 45 minutes. During all this time, MH’s boarding music blared out of the PA system. I don’t mind delays but having that jingle play for 2 hours straight at 11:30 was just torture. The stuff of nightmares, however, was the catering on the second leg. Apparently Malaysia Airlines had a falling out with their catering partner, which means that they currently don’t have a catering partner. Instead of a proper meal, you get a tuna roll and prepackaged backed goods. It was by far the worst meal I have ever seen in a plane. To add insult to injury, many of MH’s flights (including my second leg) are delayed … owing to catering problems. Yes, if you fire your caterer, then you can no longer use their trucks so loading disgusting tuna rolls onto your aircrafts takes more time. The crew was very friendly - no beverages other than water, orange juice and apple juice - no alternative option to tuna roll - infotainment aged and not that many option. No wifi, the seat on A330-300 was good for a short to medium range flight. Not the best out there but good to get a little sleep."

The flight itself was lovely, great crew and great food and excellent service. The whole thing for me fell apart due to the excessive delay of frequent flyer mile award to my BA account. Qatar awarded the points within 20 hours and on day 4 I saw that Malaysia had still not awarded the points so I thought I’d contact Malaysia Airlines via Twitter. Such rudeness and avoidance of the issue in answering the question on how long it takes Malaysia Airlines to award flight miles. They just would not answer the question, which in itself is a simple question and would set my expectation. Based on this I’ve cancelled all my forthcoming flights on Malaysia Airlines and will choose a more understanding carrier."

Once airborne, champagne, a menu and amenity kit were given out but I felt it strange no wine or drinks menu. Service was very good, all very prompt, my G&T topped up without asking, and food quickly followed. Satay was fab, the beef very good, and black forest dessert exemplary. Not alot of cabin presence in between services. There were snacks available on request according to the menu and I grabbed an ice cream pot at one point. Second service offered about 3 hours out of KL. I found the seat very comfortable and easy to use. Nice and private, and i loved the massage function.

Despite having contacted them on repeated occasions they have totally ignored my correspondence. I flew via KL just two weeks ago and even discussed my case with a representative of Malaysia Airlines at the airport in KL. She was fully aware of the abysmal record of customer services in dealing with complaints and acknowledged that most complaints are simply ignored. The appalling way in which Malaysian airlines treats its customers is clear testimony to the fact we need stronger consumer protection laws in Australia that match what the Europeans do. In terms of the substance of my complaint it was multifaceted but basically revolved around the following. Initial cancellation of my flight from KL to Tokyo Subsequent six hour delay in the flight from KL to Tokyo resulting in a 4 am arrival and no public transport available. Cancellation of my flight from Osaka to KL and a delay of 24 hours incurring hotel expenses. Preferred extra legroom seats (which I had paid for) not being carried forward when flights are cancelled. In short serious matters which had a direct financial impact but which Malaysia Airlines simply choose to ignore. Totally appalled by their lack of interest or care despite all the proclamations of the importance they attach to customer service. I recently experienced a cancelled flight on British Airways. Compensation promptly paid to cover extra expenses. Experience could not have been more different despite the fact that both these airlines are part of the same (one world) alliance

When I visited, it was packed, lots of kids running about yelling, people were paying 40 quid to get in they weren't BC PAX. Complete contrast to how good the Golden Lounge is at KUL. A350 London to KL is very good - the premier Malaysia route of course. KUL to AKL - no menus, no champagne and no snacks available. I wrote a similar review for my outbound AKL to LHR flights in June. Come on Malaysia, you're charging $11k+ for a BC flight and can't seem to get consistency or basics correct. Last time I flew Qatar, before that Emirates. I think I will swallow the extra $$$ and go back to them again which is disappointing.

The seats we were allocated in row 2, were barely even a decent premium economy. They were tight uncomfortable and cramped. My wife who had the window seat said it felt like she was trapped in a box. The amount of space allocated for these two seats is appalling. There was no storage whatsoever, not even to rest a drink bottle.

The flight was delayed for 2 hours, and I wasn't to get the connecting flight in Kuala Lumpur back to Penang, which has cost me to rebook my further journey. When you ask if there is another airlines available, the counter will tell you they have no idea. Even the supervisor is helpless. No one on ground from MAS has any idea. When asking for refund or compensation, they will lie they out, giving all sort of excuse, even if I have shown the Letter of Delay issued from MAS. This is just an irresponsible airline. As a Malaysian, I am disappointed and shameful of this kind of service. I strongly advise and recommend, STAY AWAY from MAS."
Not Verified ,"A330-200, A350-900",Solo Leisure,Business Class,Auckland to London via Papakura,June 2023,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,2.0,3,yes,5,"  Was it two different airlines I ask myself? Suspect I won't be the only review on this route, but travellers between AKL and LHR should know that the A330-200 aircraft on the AKL-KL section are ancient, the business class is sub-par, and I have travelled in many. Seats are narrow and cramped, hardly any storage space etc - rubbish. What concerned me more however, after the near 60 minute departure delay and free-for-all boarding scrum, was the cabin food service. 'Signature' chicken satay was what looked like a single dog chew and some greenery. No peanut sauce or anything. The rest of the food wasn't much better, and a few courses they just didn't bother offering. Polar opposite is the A350 from KL to London. Great BC seating, great service and definitely BC worthy eg 4 sticks chicken satay, with salad and peanut sauce etc - exemplary cabin crew. I guess the problem is that they don't charge different prices for different legs of the journey. 1 leg is worth it, the other isn't and it's selling under false pretences - they don't market BC with pics of an A330-200, getting on for 20yrs old now. So beware. Next time, I will go back to Qatar or Emirates, even if it costs a bit more."

I contacted customer service and the service agent said I had to pay extra for the date change, because I was not using the website. She acknowledged that I was entitled to a free change and that the website should work. But then refused to do anything to resolve the problem. This customer service agent was extremely rude and refused to put me through to her manager."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Auckland to Bangkok via Kuala Lumpur,May 2023,,,,,,1.0,2,no,1,"  After using book now and pay later option I could not make payment with my credit card. Many error messages after numerous attempts. Numerous call centre calls could not fix this, and they make erroneous claims as to the terms on which I had made the booking. Suggesting that my booking had times out and was no longer valid which was untrue as I had written confirmation as to when I needed to pay. Couple of these calls to their call centre cut off after 20 mins. Their system will always cut you off after 20 mins on hold After a few days I finally got a link to a site to be able to make the payment. And I asked that the actual ticket be sent to me immediately after making the payment, which was verified during that call. That never happened. Couple of days later called again to chase up the ticket. Person took long time to act, and I asked him to be sure to call me back if we got the usual cut off after 20m mins. I got cut off. He did not call back. Made another call. This time Philippines answered, No notation on my file that the previous call to KL had been made or any action arising from that. She kept me ""on line"" this time so that I would not be cut off after 20 mins. But after ~30 mins waiting I was cut off. No call back. Made another call. And they then told me there is no record of my flight being booked. But they confirmed that they had received my payment! Probably spent more than 4 hours in total on the phone and waiting over about 8 calls during this process over 4-5 days. If the departure date had been closer it would have been disastrous.  Could not be a worse experience. Almost as if they want to insult you so badly that you will go elsewhere, which I have now done. "

✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Kuala Lumpur to London,May 2023,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,5,yes,7,"  Boarding was delayed and the flight departed almost an hour late. However once at altitude the cabin crew were soon underway with the dinner service. The airline serves the traditional satay, which were very tasty. For main course I chose the chicken breast stuffed with mushrooms, again very tasty and not over-cooked. As this was an overnight after watching a film I tried to get some sleep. The flat beds on the A350 are reasonably comfortable, but quite narrow, so it can be difficult to get comfortable, however managed to get some sleep. The cabin crew on Malaysia Airlines (unlike some airlines) are still in evidence during the night and were available to get drinks, snacks such as ice-creams during the night. Breakfast was served a couple of hours prior to landing and was reasonably good. As my wife didn’t fancy any of the hot items on the menu, she was offered a choice of sandwiches which was nice. Flight landed 40 minutes late into LHR, but the immigration and baggage process was quick and we were out of the airport a little over 30 minutes after landing. Overall the Malaysia Airlines long haul experience on the A350 is good, not quite the highest level but the cabin crew service was of a good standard. The A350 cabin configuration has options for both single travellers and those travelling as a couple, we had seats D/G in the middle, which were comfortable, although storage space is a bit limited and looked better on the window seats."

Malaysia Airlines business passengers may use the Premier Lounge at Bali Airport, this lounge is shared by many airlines, it is ok but nothing special. Flight boarded on time but departure was slightly delayed due to some clean-up work that had to take place on the runway suspending all flights for a short while. The B737 was the older style aircraft that has not yet been refurbished, the seats however were comfortable for a 3 hour flight. Cabin crew were attentive and meal was served soon after take off, I chose the Red Snapper with rice and ginger soya sauce, very tasty! Malaysia do not seem to promote alcoholic drinks on their short haul flights, however seeing another passenger with a glass of red wine, we also asked for the same, however it never arrived! Weather was a bit stormy coming into KLIA and the flight landed about 30 minutes late. An OK flight and will happily use Malaysia Airlines again."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Kuala Lumpur,April 2023,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,5,yes,8,"  We were a little concerned as after booking the flights we read some negative reviews about Malaysia Airlines, however in our experience we had no reason to be worried. Check in at Heathrow T4 was quick, as was security clearance. Malaysia Airlines business class passengers can use the Qatar Airways lounge at T4 and this was good. We enjoyed a light breakfast there before the flight. Boarding on time, my wife and I had seats 5D and 5G, which meant we both had direct aisle access. Malaysia do have a pairs of seats by the window on their A350 aircraft but these are not ideal for an overnight flight if you need to disturb a sleeping partner to get out to use the rest rooms. The seats themselves were quite comfortable although a little narrow. There are only two toilets in the business class cabin on the A350, which at times meant a queue and they were quite cramped, they were however kept clean throughout the flight. Service on the flight was very good with efficient and friendly cabin crew. Dinner was served soon after take-off with signature Malaysian Satay. For the main course I chose the lamb which was tasty and not over-cooked. In-flight entertainment was good, although not at the same level of say Emirates, there were a reasonable number of relatively new films as well as classic selection. Breakfast was served a couple of hours before arrival and I chose the Nasi Lemak, which was fine. Overall a good flight on Malaysia Airlines. The cabin/seating may not be quite up to the highest standards, but service was excellent and the pricing reasonable. The safety briefing is also great fun."

The food was average and portions small. No screens on the first short flight from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur.

I was astonished to find the age of the aircraft we were flying on from KL to Perth (MH0125) and how outdated the business class was. The airlines says, business class option offers a world-class offering - I dispute this! Having flow on Cathay, Qatar they are so far behind in offering world class business offering. The old blue reclining seats were well worn, the screen would not hold position was what you expect on an internal flight in economy. We were seated mid way through economy, the meal of choice was not available. For much of the flight the air hostesses were not to be seen. Will not be flying Malaysian by choice again."

Late departure, no announcements, no notice of gate changes and all this before we took off. This is the only business class that has 1-2-2 seating meaning no aisle access if you are next to a window seat. Impossible to climb out of your flat bed seat when the stranger in the aisle seat next to you is also asleep. Touch screen was old and had to be hit hard to make it work.

At the start of the flight, the lead stewardesses went to each passenger apologizing for the delay which is something rare to see on MAS. The flight attendants polite and calling us by our first names. The food was good and the inflight Wi-Fi connectivity is simple. MH Studio provided a wide selection of entertainment. Overall, the flight itself is good and I will fly Malaysia Airlines again - especially if its in business class."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Melbourne to Ahmedabad via Kuala Lumpur,February 2023,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2,no,3,"  I booked economy class travel from Melbourne to Ahmedabad because I wouldn't hesitate to change my plans, but Malaysia Airlines' customer service made it very difficult for me to do so. I had been trying to change our return date from Ahmedabad to Melbourne for the past 10 days, and while they were able to change my wife's itinerary, they were unable to do the same for me. Despite my repeated calls, I finally spoke to a representative who informed me that I can't change your ticket from Ahemdabad because it's connected to Air India, so she suggested I change from Mumbai to Melbourne and then back to Ahmedabad. I agreed to call air India and paid around $149 for the difference, but the next day when I called air India, they told me to contact Malaysia airlines, so now I have to pay from Ahmedabad to Mumbai out of my own pocket. I tried to contact them many times, but they put me on hold and never called back, so I think this is the worst experience I've ever had with Malaysia airlines. Worst experience I've had.  Customer service at its worst."

When I arrive in Osaka to where I was to collect my bag for a transfer flight my bag did not turn up. I enquired there with JAL as to the where and they said it had not arrived and filled out a report. Very disappointing to finally arrive for a week of Snowboarding without any of your own gear. Eventually the bag was found left In Kuala Lumpur and was sent to me 5 days later after it was lost. When I finally received the bag I noticed various damages to the bag. Japan Airlines were helpful in communicating with me however I am still yet to have any communication, Apologies or compensation from Malaysia Airlines. Very disappointing and poor service."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Kuala Lumpur,March 2023,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Terrible customer and online service. We are trying to book additional extra checked-in luggage for the flight back to London from Penang and the online ""manage boking"" is a disaster. When it comes to paying for the additional extra luggage the site does not accept various different debit cards provided, displaying all types of error codes when you try. When I was finally able to pay via Paypal the transaction had gone through and money taken out of my account. However, even though money had left the account the service (extra check-in luggage) was still unconfirmed on the website and still required being paid for. This lead to the subsequent nightmare that is Malaysia airline's customer service that requires multiple attempts at ringing them with long wait times due to the calls ending without a resolution to the issue. This literally wasted hours of our time on vacation spent trying to contact Malaysia Airlines to resolve the issue and induced unnecessary stress for something that should have been relatively straight forward. Overall, I am not impressed at all with Malaysia Airlines and will not be flying with them again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne,March 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,2,"  I'm unhappy with the traveling with MAS. Originally on our ticket the flight was leaving at 21:50, then a notice via email on the same day at 18:00 stating that there was a flight delay and would be leaving 1 hour later making It 22.50 departure, there was no explanation of why there was a delay or alteration in time. For the flight to Melbourne to KL, also alteration in time. Our initial flight was to leave Melbourne at 15:10 but was informed and changed to 14:10 one hour earlier (on 1st Feb 2023) again with no explanation given to why there was an alteration. We have done online check in both in Melbourne and Kuala Lumpur however there is no special counter for those online check in. We have to queue up for more than 1.5 hours in Melbourne even though we have done online check in. I asked the MAS officer why we still have to queue up in line despite having checked in online. She had no idea and said the customer just had to queue up even though had checked in online. During the flight I found that some cabin crew were rude and impatient. Our seats were 17K and 17H. The stewardess had no friendly greetings when it came to serving the food and refreshments. My food was not of a good quality and did not taste very nice. There was one dish that was supposedly a pizza but there was no way to hold it and no cutlery given to eat it with it was stuck to the packaging it came in. My friend asked the stewardess about this and she said to use a serviette, it was so sticky and was stuck to the box and I had to use my hand. The fruit dish was not fresh and tasteless and the coffee was not pleasant. The baggage claim had to wait around 1 hour waiting for luggage."

The return flight, London to KL was surprisingly pleasant. The crew were kind and efficient - friendly even. Smiles all round and very helpful. Food was marginally better this time round. The crew even heated up the buns that came with the meal! I really have to give this team credit. They did everything to ensure the passengers were comfortable. When we landed in KL, both the pilots and crew got a round of applause. That pretty much sums up the journey. In view of my previous experience with a terrible crew, I would suggest MAS look into teams which are not performing to standard because they genuinely spoil the image for the company. A very heartfelt thank you to the London-KL crew - you really are a credit to the company."

The most disappointing part was the check in service counter where I had to pay for excess baggage. The representative was charging me 15USD extra per kg compared to the price shown on the official website of the airline. Upon asking why, the representative said he does not know and I should take it up with the airline - which was highly unprofessional. I ended up paying 75USD extra for my excess baggage, compared to the price I should have paid as per the airline’s website."

This is for an upcoming flight (Brisbane-Sydney-KL on April 25) which I cancelled because they changed my flight (due to route suspension) without first informing me. I booked to fly direct Brisbane-KL and after my complaint to their Customer Relations dept, I was informed by them on 29/12/22 that I could ask for a full refund. Well, I cancelled on 5/1/23 and until today, no refund in sight. I contacted their call center again on 23/1/23, 14/1/23, and 20/1/23 to complain, but it was a waste of time and money. "

I took Malaysia Airline to Incheon from Kuala Lumpur and the best part of the 6 hours of journey was that the crew were providing with soft drinks and the food served was so great. They had a Korean stewardess working in the plane so it was easier and comfortable to communicate with her whenever i needed a help or anything. Thank you for your best service.

I purchased a seat prior to 25 December departure (8F), at check in I was handed a boarding pass with 7F and in addition, the check in rep told me seat was 13A according to a pop-up. I explained I paid for 8F though. She said she couldn’t explain why so told me to go to the service desk. I went there and the rep said I was moved to allow a family to sit together. I wasn’t asked, I was just moved, twice. Of course I wouldn’t wish to split up a family if they had young kids. On all my complaint correspondence (no response) I always attach my boarding pass (7F) and my itinerary with 8F. Has been 3 times I’ve contacted them (in 52 days). All I’m asking for is a refund of seat purchase. I paid unnecessarily as I wasn’t given what I paid for. Why won’t Malaysia Airlines respond to me? They took money from me and now avoiding me."

The temperature in the cabin was freezing to the point of having 3 blankets luckily as the flight wasn't full etc. Due to that fact you couldn't get comfortable with being so cold, the flight was a nightmare. Many passengers said that they shivered all the journey. We had priority economy seats which I was so pleased with until the journey began, I felt so poorly with being so tired, it tarnished the whole experience."

The product offered by Malaysian does not deserve to be called Business Class. Compared to other airlines from Asia it is at best Premium Economy. Chaotic security check and boarding process; no priority line. No fully reclining seats. Narrow seats. No comprehensive drink selection for welcome drinks. Drinks even warm after take-off. Very limited choice on menu for breakfast. In general: very old plane with worn seats. Very bad value for money. I have a return flight from Perth to Kuala Lumpur in about 9 days which I am not looking forward to at all. After that I will never use Malaysia Airlines again. Singapore or Thai may ask for higher prices but then I get a product which meets international business class standards.

I was not informed by Malaysia airline that my flight was delayed from 930am to 230pm! When I realised the delay at the airport self check in counter I went to a counter and the lady raised her voice with frustration and repeated, You want info is it? I told her yes I need info on my flight. She just simply told me off that this is not info counter and asked me to head to the info counter in front. The info counter has no idea what's going on with the daily routine and pushed me to seek help from another counter C and D. When I got to the counter, they were puzzled why I am there. The whole ping pong game goes round for another 2 counters. In total I need to go 5 counters just to know my flight is confirmed delay. Really one of the worst airlines that can simply just spoil your trip instantly."
Not Verified ,A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Colombo via Kuala Lumpur,February 2023,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,2,"  This airline is incredibly poor. First the flight was delayed three times while already on the plane due to technical issues. They claimed to have it fixed three times and three times it failed. After spending three hours on the plane and not moving plus dealing with the heat as they wouldn't turn the air-conditioning on. We were offered the smallest bag of peanuts as compensation. I can accept a poor flight, however we missed our connecting flight and were put on the next available flight at 3:30 in the morning ruining our planned transport and accommodation. We were given no compensation. But the thing that has tipped me over the edge is we decided to buy extra legroom for our return flight. After being hung up on we where finally able to book and pay for this. Then 36 hours later we were charged again for the same amount. I have really struggled in dealing with this airline and then to find out that they have held my card details for over 24 hours and felt it acceptable to change us with out consent is disgusting. I promise this will be the last time I fly with this airline!"

We are still waiting and Malaysia airlines have not responded to a single email we have sent. Apparently they are trying to find the baggage, by the pictures we have, among the hundreds of other bags they have lost.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Kuala Lumpur to CDG, Paris via Heathrow, London",January 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1,no,1," Premium price for budget airline product/service. First time with MAS long haul flight. Considering its a 14 hr flight nothing is done to ensure passengers comfort. You don't even get an amenities bag. Seats were small and cramped with hardly any leg room. (I'm 152 cm) Cabin crew seemed unfriendly and disgruntled. No smiles and very reluctant service. Ask for another drink with dinner you get a look. Ask for some water you get a small cup with barely 2 mouthfuls. Ask for more coffee with your breakfast, it never came. Meals were small, of poor quality and were served with a long 9-10 hour interval. Breakfast frittata was like eating plastic. Entertainment quite basic compared to other airlines. Movies TV shows were so heavily censored that you lose the plot sometimes. Truly the most disagreeable flight I've been on. I will stick with the Middle Eastern carriers from now on. Better value for money and they actually know what customer service is."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Auckland to Bangalore via Kuala Lumpur,January 2023,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,2.0,1,no,2,"  We, a family of four travelled to India in Dec 2022 and returned back in Jan 2023. On our departure from Auckland to Kuala Lumpur, the flight was delayed a few times and finally took off 12 hours after the original scheduled time and we missed our second connecting flight to India. So, we had to wait another 12 hours in KL to catch the next possible connecting flight. From KL to Bangalore, the airline staff refused to take one of our cabin bags into the flight saying our bag is too big for the cabin but later I came to know that our bag was not the problem but that there was not enough space inside the cabin. Our luggage had also not arrived with us when we landed and was supposedly lost in Malaysia. They also refused to let a few other passengers bags carry their carry on luggage into the plane as well. Staff should have admitted the problem with passengers rather than blaming the customers on perfectly acceptable cabin luggage. On our return trip flight from KL to AuckIand, our families seats were spread out into separate rows which made the trip uncomfortable as the people next to us hadn't selected the seats next to us but were also placed randomly. I had e-mailed and also spoken to MH customer service over the phone and requested them sort this out well in advance prior to our flight but they did not do anything. Airline food was average. We had a bad travelling experience with MH."

Once I arrived in Kuala Lumpur i was running so fast to catch my next flight going to Manila. But when I arrived in Manila yesterday, my luggage are not there.

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Langkawi to Singapore via Kuala Lumpir,January 2023,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,3.0,3,yes,8,"  The flight from Langkawi to Singapore was a two-flight combination using the B737-800. I had booked and paid for exit row 14 on both sectors and the leg room was generous. On the first leg, wifi streaming entertainment was available while on the second segment, personal TV was available. As I was seated at the exit window seat 14A, the left armrest was a truncated armrest so that it will not block the emergency exit. Both flight sectors were around 1 hour and shortly after take off, a packet of peanuts and orange juice was served. Being such short flights, nothing more was expected."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Auckland to London via Kuala Lumpur ,January 2023,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Would never fly with Malaysia Airlines again and definitely don't recommend them. I flew between London Heathrow to Auckland via Kuala Lumpur mid-December 2022, returning to Heathrow the first week of January 2023. Every single flight was delayed, luggage was lost on return to London (the delay was ample time to allow the ground crew to transfer the bags), and cabin crew were rude. On one leg the steward was so fed up telling every passenger the meal choices (first airline ever that didn't hand out meal choice cards) that all we got was 'spicy or non-spicy' before the tray & croissant were literally thrown at us. This is also the first time my luggage has never made it back at the same time as I did. The airline made no announcements regarding delayed flights, and no apology either. The outbound flight arrived over 3 hours late in Auckland meaning my sister had to order & pay for a taxi to pick me up. Should have arrived on Thursday evening at 2355 - instead we arrived after 3am on Friday morning! A complete farce from beginning to end."

The staff on ground promised that luggage will put on priority to go on board together with us on scheduled flight, ended up none of the promises happened. Luggage now is missing. All their customer services was of no help, mishandling dept refused to answer any of the calls, emails got blocked. During the delayed we tried calling, after a while they even refused to accept any of our calls to let us know what is going on. Calls keep getting cut off. This airline is really spoiling the country's image."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Business,Business Class,Manila to Kuala Lumpur,January 2023,3.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,,2.0,3,yes,7,  One of the better MH flights recently from MNL to KUL - was on time - recently the afternoon flights have been delayed a couple of hours. Seated in BC. Service was good- although the quality of food out of MNL was poor. Check in - the MH staff refused to allow me to bring my rimowa roll on. It’s the bigger cabin version of roll on- have taken it on over 80 flights last year with no issue. I don’t know what the issue was but think as usual the business class check in with MH at NAIA is staffed by the average Joe where as most airlines put their better staff on BC check in.
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800ng,Business,Economy Class,Johor Bahru to Kuala Lumpur,January 2023,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,4,yes,10,  A much better effort by Malaysia Airlines in a refurbished cabin 737-800.

Polite crew. On time. Easy - it’s a good job by Malaysia Airlines on this sector. The 737 is probably one due for a cabin refit.

Immediately trouble occurred at check in. The people there said we need vaccine certificates to enter Bangladesh so we were urgently searching for them. However, the immigration at Bangladesh didn't even bother to check if we had vaccine certificates so there was all that panic for nothing. The flight was pretty enjoyable since the IFE had a decent selection. Meal was also pretty good. To be honest though, I could not sleep and highly suggest that Malaysia Airlines fly A330s on this route because you don't want be on a 737 for 6hrs."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Business,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Johor Bahru,January 2023,2.0,2.0,,1.0,,1.0,3,no,3," On boarding this flight 30 minutes late I was told I was being moved from economy 4D to 15D. Being One World Emerald (actually my home airline is MH) I would have expected to be at least moved close to my original row. Instead I was told no more seats - change of aircraft type, your row is 4 which would be business in this aircraft. Sitting front row economy is my usual - meeting has to attend. I was fairly rudely ignored by the ground and aircraft crew. 15D had a bust armrest and a malfunctioning TV screen. My 2 pieces of clearly marked PRIORITY and one world business class came out las. Again another poor showing by MH - I supported this airline through the pandemic - poor understanding of customers."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Aickland,December 2022,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,4,no,2,"  Flew to New Zealand on a direct flight from Malaysia and they failed to load my bag. Within 24 hours they said they had found and would forward it. Then silence. Their local agents were uncontactable and the number in Malaysia was never answered. 4 weeks later and they still won’t admit they can’t find the bag (‘give us more time’ they say on social media - the only way to contact them). So overall a very disappointing experience. I have to fly with them again as I already have the tickets, but given the choice I would never use them again. The service on the aircraft was gods, although entertainment etc poor compared to most competitors. Malaysia Airlines doesn’t advertise as ‘Premium Economy but the front three rows of economy are ‘extra legroom’ for which you pay more and would be Premium Economy on most airlines. The extra space was welcome."

We departed HCMC on the 23rd December where our flight was delayed by just over an hour. This had a compounding impact meaning we missed our connecting flight which was also Malaysian Airlines. No communication between flights or even registered in their system. We were then scheduled onto another flight the next day meaning one night at the airport. They did put us up at a hotel in the airport. I asked several times - please ensure our luggage is on the rescheduled flight and we were reassured it would be by the help desk staff. The next flight was also delayed by well over an hour meaning we arrived in Auckland 4:30am on 25th of December. We waited and waited for our luggage to come out. It did not! It did not make it to the plane as we were promised. We registered our lost luggage at Auckland airport and made our way to our accommodation. 7 days later we have been told our luggage arrived on the 26th December, It is now the 31st December and we still do not have our luggage or any indication when we will get it. Zero accountability, zero compensation or responsibility and no empathy from the airlines. This airline is dysfunctional and incompetent. We trusted them with our safety and our luggage. Sentimental gifts for Christmas have been lost and undelivered. I will never recommend or use Malaysian Airlines ever again. Very poor!"

We arrived New Zealand at noon on December 22nd. Until now, our luggage went missing. We tried several time to contact their representatives but no one answered. Finally someone responded us and say they don’t know where our luggage is, they can’t call to follow up the status for us, and nothing they can do… All our personal belongings, Xmas gifts, special memories from friends and family are now somewhere. It’s frustrating especially during this Christmas time. When it’s gonna arrived? Will it be delivered and in the original status? Who will responsible for those missing items? Since no one take this seriously, I hope to share this information so that less people receive the bad experience like me."

Redeemed my flight ticket using enrich points for return trip from Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu using Malaysia Airlines. I am a platinum/emerald on One World but my experience with Malaysia Airline is is bad. MH has gone to a low class airline. My flight at 2040 and checked in at 1700. I asked if I can board the 1820 flight or 1930 flight but was not allowed as the redemption ticket is ‘not changeable’. I am not able to pay to change and was offered to buy another ticket if I want to. See this is the kind of airline that is cheap. There were seats, and plenty, but no flexibility and consideration. So I question why should I ever accumulate Enrich or fly on MH. Then come to boarding time at 1940. Plane arrived at 2010 and two announcements made i) 2020h that flight is delayed due to operational reason and passengers will be updated in 20 mins time ii) 2043h that flight is delayed and passengers be updated in 20 mins time. Malaysian Hospitality is a far away from what you have hoped. There are much to be learnt and catch up. "

We were asked to get the boarding pass for Singapore to Kuala Lumpur, and from KL to Chennai for their ""transfer counter"" in Singapore. It was difficult to find out where they are, but eventually, we did. They were woefully inadequate for the tasks. There was one lady  who was singing songs and chatting with colleagues and distracting them. We missed connecting flights. Later we found that she had scrubbed my wife's name from the ticket for a slight variation in the spelling of her given name - Judy for Judith. We produced all verifications, but she was discourteous and stranded her in Singapore. In the end, she bought a new ticket and flew to Chennai. We proceeded to KL, but scheduled flights were delayed several times, and we reached one and half days late. "

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Business Class,Kuala Lumpur to Kuching,November 2022,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,4.0,1,no,3,"  We had the pleasure of flying on MAS's new domestic business class. The removal of TVs, reduced legroom, reduced business class luggage compartments (due to the cabin arrangement) and no partition between business and economy class while charging the same price as before does not a premium experience or happy customer make. I can appreciate removing TVs in favour of streaming since everyone has a phone but the IFE didn't let you skip ads until you watched at least 30s. Furthermore, normally no TVs means more underseat storage but not here due to the poor position of the chair leg and IFE box (right in the middle). This is an important point since there's only 2 dedicated overhead bins for business now while 2 bins are shared with economy. Regarding the seat, it was better padded than the previous despite being slimmer. However, it was obvious that MAS has reduced the legroom to stuff in more economy seats. In addition, some buttons were already broken despite it being a new plane according to the stewardess. Sitting in the last row also meant an unpleasant lack of privacy with the removal of the solid partition between economy and business. The only thing that made this flight bearable was our cabin crew who were lovely. They were professional and polite and made up for the poor quality of the hard product."

I had connected flight with them and their flight delayed for 4 hours which resulted in passengers missing their next flight .Pathetic response from staff no responsibility taken , no apologies. My next flight was 24 hours later. I could not get accommodation in the airport I could not go out as Immigration would not let me one day visa. I have to spent full day with my infant son and I paid for all other costs because the flight won't take responsibility.

✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to London,November 2022,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3,no,4,"  The airline is indeed one of the cheapest in the region having direct flights to London. With past experience, the airline was world renowned for its hospitality. This turn to the worst during my recent trip with the airlines. Check in with the airline was seamless thanks to the efficiency of the ground staff and security personnel. Once boarded, we were greeted with friendly smiles from the cabin crew as we walked to our seat. Once the plane started taxing to the runway, things changed. The crew somewhat became more hostile and there was a lot of confusion going on in the flight. The were aggressive in their tone and acted in a way that was way off from their marketing self proclaimed Malaysian Hospitality. For the confusion part, there was a son and mother seating at the opposite of us, and another lady which was assigned to the window seat. As the mother required a slightly bigger space, the on checked with the lady and the cabin crew before taxi if the lady would mind to shift seats. The lady agreed and guided by the cabin crew to another seat. Upon lift off, the lady was seen walking aimlessly throughout the aisle and she mentioned another cabin crew chased her back as the front seat is Premium Economy and she is not entitled to be there.  Another cabin crew then approached and raised her voice to ask her why is the lady shifting seats, and it took some time for the crew to understand that they messed up. During meals, the trays are pushed to you as thought they were waiting for ages for you to take the tray from them. The crew seems to not be bothered that it was a night flight as most passengers were sleeping, hence during service, there would take some time to adjust to the surrounding instead of abruptly asking what do they want to eat. Meal completion was  shocking as trays were just taken from the passengers hands as they handed to the crew one by one.  Flight entertainment on the other hand was far better than the one's they had on their Boeing. The screen is more responsive and clearer."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Adelaide to Kuala Lumpur,November 2022,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,  I had a direct flight from Adelaide to KUL with Malaysian airline. For checkin the staff had a rude and impolite behavior with us.  When I was in Malaysia I saw that all cabin crew and staff were very nice and friendly. But in Adelaide the staff that did the check in was very impolite and she also fined me more than 2 hundred AUD without any reasonable reason. She knew that we are in rash so she did not care our request and she just want to fined us. I think a bad behavior from a staff can affect the popularity of an airline and I have never forgotten this behavior.

Once inside the terminal it was absolute chaos with the queue for Malaysia airlines snaking halfway round the airport terminal, people were shoving and pushing to jump the queue and all of this mayhem was being controlled by just one man (this gentleman should be awarded a medal for his efforts for stopping a riot) Even though we had checked in online the day before we still had to queue for almost 4 hours just to drop our hold bags at the counter, eventually we made it to the plane and departed Sydney around 15.00 hrs. The next 24hrs of travel through to Dublin were without a doubt the worst travel experience i have ever endured (from inedible food to airline staff who appeared to have just given up) Upon arrival in Ireland we then had another lengthy delay as they had lost our luggage, six days later we were eventually reunited with our suitcases. I would strongly advise anyone thinking about using this airline to reconsider as they give a strong impression that they are on the way out."

My phone number and email address were provided to contact me if they need to talk to me, I haven't gotten any call or email from them, they just left the passenger middle of the airport.

The flights are old and not upgraded, in flight entertainment experience is ridiculous, the steward and stewardess are rigid, SOP are still so old school, speechless on the food that are served, overall experience is just below standard. When I booked a work trip flight to BKK, the cost was Rm2.4k in total (given it was booked the week before). I was not given any check in bags and I have to pay Rm240 just to check 1 bag in. They told me that the flight I bought does not have check in bags, which  puzzles me because how in the world I'm paying this amount for just a flight from kl to Bangkok and do not have a check in bag allowed? The only reason I realized this was when I was flying back I bought multiple liquid items that is more than 350ml which is why I'm checking in. Imagine the surprise I have from the ground staff. I cannot imagine why there is an option without check bags for a flight like Malaysia Airlines for the price that we are paying. "

Boarding in KL was well managed and the aircraft left on time. The cabin crew were pretty much absent on boarding but the purser of the flight was very amiable and friendly and went out of his way to greet passengers and chat to them. A shout to Rufus, the purser, who even lent me his personal charging cord and plug when mine failed. He went out of his way to assist. Cabin service was efficient but staff didn't really interact with the passengers but remained pleasant and cheerful. The IFE was poor, big screens, good resolution but disappointing content. The seat was comfortable and there was plenty of legroom. The food was awful, very small portions and not tasty. Their signature nasi lemak was very disappointing but they did serve two 'full' meals and one minuscule tuna roll mid-flight. The FAs kept is well watered but alcohol choices were poor and not made clear to passengers. Overall, this was a reasonable flight and everything went smoothly apart from the food which could be much better."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bali to Kathmandu via Kuala Lumpur,April 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I bought a round trip ticket with this airline from Bali to Kathmandu via Kuala Lumpur, 5 days later the airline cancelled a part of the itnerary. I called the customer service which refused to provide an alternative flight in a flexible time frame of over a month. Therefore I asked for my refund which I was informed it could take up to 6 months. 6 months past now and still haven't seem my 900 usd spent with this company. I paid my ticket, the airline cancel it, refuses to find a alternative with a very flexible timeframe, say will hold the money for 6 months, which is already ridiculous, but still even after 6 months haven't refunded me.

Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Auckland via Kuala Lumpur,October 2022,,,,,,,1,no,2," Malaysia Airlines is appalling. I cannot even complete a booking. I was issued with an E Voucher when my earlier Covid affected flight was cancelled last year. Online booking would not accept my voucher (saying it was an invalid number). I then rang and dealt with their booking office. To date I have made 7 calls over past 5 days and after their finding the voucher and acknowledging its expiry is 31 December despite saying it was no longer valid, we now find the fare has nearly doubled in the past 5 days. Promises of resolution and call backs are just empty insincere promises.  And the booking office message begins with ""We are committed to providing you with exceptional service experience."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phnom Penh to Colombo via Kuala Lumpur,September 2022,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,1,no,1,  Worse customer service ever.  I bought a ticket from Cambodia to Sri Lanka from Malaysia Airlines website and paid for excess luggage of 15kg more. Before the flight I call to confirm all my details are correct with the booking. When I arrive on the day of the flight at the airport Counter the 15kg was showing on the computer but they couldn't accept it coz the of error. I was made to pay for another 15 kg at airport price of $25 a kg.  Airport manager assured me when I arrive at the destination I can claim my money back and I need to pay to take my excess luggage. I called Malaysia Airlines they put me on hold for 1/2 hr each time and cut the line. I asked to speak to the manager they refused and then put me on hold and cut the line. This has happened over a dozen times now . Also I have screen shots of the airport booking info (before and after) they have been changed and not showing then previous payment for the 15kg that I paid before the flight. I still haven't got my money back.

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Perth,September 2022,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,2.0,1,no,5,"  Malaysia Airlines flight review from KL to Perth. The flight was overall alright but in terms of price paid, it might be a little disappointing to be paying the price of a full service airline carrier. The most disappointing part of the whole trip is when you want to make a claim for a damaged bag. It has been 3 weeks now from the last time I lodged a report on their website / portal and have yet to hear from them. No idea why their customer service is so poor post-flight. It is an embarrassment for a national carrier to treat its passengers so poorly. Their neighbouring country, Singapore Airlines service would bring shame to the services provided by Malaysia Airlines."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,London to Bali via Kuala Lumpur,September 2022,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,2,no,3," One of the worst airlines I have travelled. I booked my flights 8 months in advance. A nightmare. Four main issues: 1) Only when logging in to manage my reservation 2 weeks before departure did I realise they had cancelled one of the flights on my journey and rebooked me onto an alternative flight which meant that instead of a 2 hour layover between connecting flights, it was now 8 hours! I was not informed of this change in flight schedule which I find absolutely abhorrent and unprofessional. 2) There was an alternative flight on the same day with the same route which would have resulted in a 4 hour layover time which is undoubtedly better but they allocated me the earlier flight. No common sense at all and infuriating! 3) After multiple phone calls and emails from my travel agent requesting the alternative flight, they kept getting told it wasn’t possible to change the flight but without any explanation and we were then told it was fully booked but they would put us on a waiting list. However when I called to complain they said there was plenty of availability and the travel agent needed to request the change. So we went round and round in circles with the final answer being the flight was fully booked and nothing could be done. It took me quoting aviation law demanding either compensation or an alternative flight and daily messaging with a formal complaint to finally get switched to the next flight and guess what, at least 20 empty seats available on the flight! 4) Two people on the booking with same reference number. 3 out of 4 flights our seats automatically allocated next to each other which makes sense. Except the last 13 hr flight from Kuala Lumpur to London where we were allocated seats 4 rows apart! I complained and complained at every step of the journey and nothing could be done because all seats had been allocated. Now firstly, I checked in 36 hrs before the flight which would make you think that’s plenty of time to choose seats! But secondly, and most importantly, despite timing of checking in online, how does their system allow this to happen where if anyone can select their chosen seats it means a group can be split and sit separately! Every other airline has a system in place that would put people together despite time of check in and stop groups selecting random seats to their individual preference to prevent groups being split. What ended up happening is many groups were split up because their system allowed people who checked in earlier to select whatever seats they wanted including window and aisle seating living middle seats empty! Idiotic system to say the least and no thought process. Honestly, this airline is incompetent beyond belief and their systems are so archaic with the upper management staff not being of much help at all, probably because they can’t change the system and have no authority to make much change. Avoid at all costs!"
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur,September 2022,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,3.0,2,no,4,"  After 3 years absence due to pandemic restrictions, also as an Enrich gold member, I was very much looking forward to flying with Malaysia airlines again. It was a return trip from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur. My high hopes were completely crushed after the 2 flights. My review would be too long if I had to write about everything. So I just simply summed up what we're most disappointing to me.  State of the aircraft is old and poorly maintained. Crew service was not consistent, some good, but some were very subpar. Meal quality has dropped to a dangerously low level, with tiny portion barely the size of my mobile phone screen! Served on a cardboard box with just a packet of peanuts and a small bottle water. Came also with cheap filmy plastic cutlery, reminiscent of budget airlines. Not ok for a premium airlines like this!  New safety video featuring silly dancing and singing with little regards to conveying the message if safety In short, it shows that they are in financial difficulties, and also lost directions and survival strategies. Once it was possible to use mileage to upgrade, but they removed that feature. Plus introducing new pricing system, and fees for this and that. I used to favor this airlines before the pandemic hit in 2020. After these flights, I see less and less reasons to remain loyal, I will seriously consider shifting my business and loyalty elsewhere after I have used up all my mileage with them."

I was proven wrong. Malaysia Airlines have improved tremendously since I last flown with them pre pandemic! No doubt all airlines are restarting their business and so is MH. They are trying their best to develop the same 5 star image when they were on par with other similar airlines. I travelled with my family of four and never had any problems at all. There were a slight delay from London but it was well communicated. The journey back was seamless without any problems. Well done MH and keep on working hard and you’ll reach the peak, once again!"

Meals were basic but hot and tasty and good selection of soft drinks (no alcohol served). Overnighted in KL then returned early morning for continuation flight. As a Oneworld Emerald customer was able to visit the Malaysia Airlines Regional Golden Lounge. Seat in exit row on the shorter leg (KUL-BKK) gave extra legroom, worth it for the discounted upgrade price of USD14. Only disappointment was the inflight entertainment. Tiny screen and lack of choices for movies. IFE needs a full overhaul. Excellent value for the price otherwise, and will definitely be using MH for regional Asia flights."

A midnight flight. No pre-check in fast track service. Staff at check in rude. Flight delay for more than an hour with no explanation. Aircraft is there, must be some technical issue. The crews was not very warm welcoming. On arrival to KL, told the connecting flight was cancelled. I was never told about the cancellation. Has to wait in the KL airport for extra 3.5 hours. Was told by agent the flight was cancelled 3 weeks ago. I was never contacted. I would have ask for refund and go for another airline as I need to be in BK at 2pm for the meeting. Compliant but no reply as usual. Inflight service is sub-standard, crew not interested to the passengers. Food is ordinary. I don't think I will use it the airline again."

The staff asked for my One Health Pass issued by the Philippines. I was shocked to find out at such last minute. The staff said the front office should not had issued me the boarding pass if I do not process this health certificate. They refused to let me board the plane. They said my check in will be returned and I will have to buy a new ticket for the next available flight. I confronted the issuing officer and he just washed his hands by saying I should have done my own research before flying. To add salt to my wound he wants me to get a new ticket at 2800rm. 6 times the original price. I bought another ticket from Philippines Airlines and because MAS failed to return my checked in I missed this Philippines Airlines ticket too. Can you believe they cannot find my check in luggage. Now I have to buy my 3rd ticket. Malaysia Airline agree to fly my bag to Manila if found.

Was not told until a week later because I live in Adelaide and only received the bill late. So I immediately contacted the airline to clear things over. Wanted to cancel the purchase and was told I cannot. Wanted to speak to a manager and waited 2 days without any contact. Called them and had to go through another consultant only to be told a manager would say the same. I felt that this is a con because they did quote me a price but charged another when I took the initiative to contact them from overseas. To make things worst, I can't even cancel it!"

After numerous emails, Malaysia Airlines has still not compensated my parents. It is ridiculous that they flew business class and still received such poor service. Moreover, it was a direct flight, which makes the lost baggage an even more baffling incident.  Nevertheless, no efforts to compensate our parents have been made. It has been almost 2 months since they returned home without their bags, and Malaysia Airlines is still dodging all compensation requests. "

MH did put us in a hotel but it took a long time to arrange and was really confusing and stressful with very little direction. The following evening our flight had a technical problem and we missed our connection in Doha. For some reason Malaysia Airlines booked us a flight departing a full 12 hours later to London with a connecting flight to Manchester - despite there being a direct flight to Manchester just a few hours later - there were also earlier flights to London - quite why Malaysia Airlines decided to put us on such poor connections is beyond me. We are currently due to arrive in destination 2 days later than planned. Throughout this ordeal MH staff have been confused and unhelpful which has led to a very stressful flight.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Mumbai to Kuala Lumpur ,July 2022,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1,no,2," During check in Malaysia Airlines demanded all luggage be weighed including hand luggage and carry-ons, food, laptop with case and other small hand carried items like medication. This was a total shock, never in my years of travel has an airline company gone this far, anyhow the conclusion was our group was deemed 15kgs over and charged 250US, however additional luggage on their website is calculated at 40US for 10kg, absolutely appalling behaviour for the overcharge. On arrival to Kuala Lumper Malaysia Airlines lost our charged luggage bag and we waited at the airport half a day until it was located and brought to us. We were unable to leave the airport as the bag contained medication. We lost half a day of our holiday and a total inconvenience to our transfers and accommodation. We decided since Malaysia Airlines was cutthroat when we checked in our Luggage we would also make a complaint and request a refund for the paid checked in luggage they lost and found hours later. No response till now days later, will never fly with this airline again and will not recommend anyone to fly with Malaysia Airlines."

I travel extensively and this airline has the worst imaginable customer service I have ever faced. Having spent 4 hrs on the phone sorting out an issue with them the staff were rude, unhelpful and just lazy. They kept trying to defer the problem and asking me to call back the following day. They did not call back themselves after promising to therefore had to spent hours longer on the phone. They also refused to put a supervisor on the phone. My business has always used Malaysia Airlines due to where I work but I will never use them again."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo to Perth via Kuala Lumpur,July 2022,,,,,,2.0,1,no,1,"  I bought a ticket from Tokyo to Perth back in March. At that time, they were selling the best connection flight with the reasonable fare. The transit time at KUL was a few hours for the both going and returning. After I purchased, the flight was changed several times. The last flight schedule they put on us required us to stay at KUL airport for a day when going and two days(!!) when returning. And because this was transit, I was supposed to stay at the airport for two days which was practically impossible. I called them several times and they only proposed the alternative route which would still make us stay at KUL for a day and needed to shorten our trip from 14 days to 10 days. I asked them to connect me with their manager and they said they will call me back which never happened of course. To my astonishment, they were selling a perfect connection flight from KUL to Tokyo on their homepage. I pointed it out and they said that they were unable to put us on this flight because it is a code-share flight.  They should have some flexibility rather than putting this problem on their customers. I gave up fixing this and canceled the flight at the last minute. I eventually re-booked a flight with another airline. Never fooled with their original flight schedule with a nice price. It is nothing if it never happens and you would eventually feel a lot of stress / pay for a lot more."

I was put flight MH123 to Sydney departing at 23.45pm, than flight to Perth arriving late afternoon on the 29th June, over 24hours after I was meant to land. Which meant waiting at the airport for over 15 hours than, taking another 12-hour flight than another 5 hour flight when my original flight from KL to Perth was only another 5 hours. Making my 20-hour journey into an over 40-hour Journey. I am vegetarian and was given no options to get a vegetarian meal with online check in or when booking my tickets when I asked for a vegetarian meal on the flight, I got told I had to book 48 hours in advance witch is ridiculous. When I had these complications with my flight, I asked to be given a vegetarian meal on the next flight as it was the least, they could do, and they gave me the same response. I got given ‘food’ and ‘accommodation’ at the airport which was disgusting and again as a vegetarian the only thing I could eat was Lukewarm pasta and tomato sauce, which was gross. When I asked to use the phone at the Malaysia airlines desk to make some international calls I was denied by the airline and had to use another passengers. How was my family to know I was safe when I didn’t arrive at Perth airport when I intended too. I called up this afternoon asking for some compensation and got told because I had redeemed my alternative flights given to me, I was entitled to none.  I shall never be flying with this airline again and the ‘cheap’ price is not even worth it. My experience with this airline was worse than my experience with long haul budget airlines. "

I tried but was not able to check in online. I arrived at the airport and joined the queue for check in counter at 9:30am. There were only 2 passengers in front of me. The ground staff was super slow and was busy chit chatting to passengers. It was 9:55am when I got to the counter. First, the ground staff claimed not to be able to find my ticket. Once she found it, she told me I could not check in because it was too late even though the flight was not taking off until 10:40am. I was directed to the ticket counter and I was was told I needed to buy a new ticket. I ended buying a new ticket with AirAsia but had to wait at the airport till 6:20pm for the new flight. I went back to lodge a complaint with the ground staff manager. The man showed up and was defensive and dismissive the entire time. Not making eye contact. He asserted I joined the wrong queue for special needs even though there was no signage to inform passengers. Basically he hinted that I was my fault for not being able to check in. I told him the line I was in only have 2 passengers ahead of me while the so called normal line had 10 passengers. Common sense told me my line should be faster. He claimed the other line with 10 passengers definitely should be faster. He also told me I had no idea what the ground staff was saying to the other passengers ahead of me and I needed to appreciate the condition they worked under. I informed him that I would lodge an online complaint but given my experience thus far I do not expect any satisfactory response from the airlines. The ground staff manager actually told me “you do whatever you want”! "

We had a flight booked to Kota Kinabulu on Malaysian Airlines at 09:15 on Saturday 2nd April and had intended to take our rapid antigen test on arrival at KK airport, given this would have been within 24hrs of arriving in Malaysia - we had been informed this was OK to do by the immigration staff on arrival at KL, given we were in transit to Sabah. When we arrived to check in for our flight, Malaysian Airlines would not allow us to check in, even though we had cleared immigration in KL. They made us take a new PCR test before they would allow us to board the flight, which meant we missed our original flight and had to re-book on another flight. We were informed by the Dr2U service where we had our PCR test that we didn't need a PCR test, but we had no alternative but to do so, because Malaysian Airlines would not less us board until we had taken a test, and the results were negative. As a result of the delays we missed our first day's activities in Sabah and had to spend 700 MR on PCR tests we did not need to take. everyone we spoke in Malaysia (excepting Malaysian Airlines staff) said we did not need to get the PCR test, we were not international travellers, but Malaysian Airlines refuse to acknowledge their mistake."

It is ridiculous that the airline just cancel a booked flight, force customer to take transit and do not compensate anything on my time lose nor do not allow refund at all. This is the most ridiculous customer service ever! If they are not flying, they should not published the flight and allow customer to purchase. This is obviously a ripped-off and leave customer with no choice. They obviously do not care about the inconvenient they caused to their customer. I regretted booking a flight with this airline and I won't do so again."
Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Brisbane to Kuala Lumpur,May 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I booked a flight with Malaysia Airlines from Brisbane to Kuala Lumpur. I received an email letting me know my flight was rescheduled for Two days later. Even for a two-hour delay, most airlines compensate customers. Because I had a connection flight and two days later did not work for me, I asked the airline to cancel my flight. I was told that I should pay $200 as a penalty for canceling my flight. I again asked them to change the departure city from Sydney to that of my original booking. I would pay for a flight to Sydney from my pocket since most airlines provide this option. Then they told me that I needed to pay $700 and they would do it for me!  In response to my request to cancel this flight and give me a voucher for my next trip, the staff replied they don't have this policy. Why should I pay for their mistakes? I had to pay $200/per person to cancel my flight. I regret booking a flight with this airline and I won't do so again. "

I paid £200 to upgrade my seats and then all of a sudden they changed my plane on both outbound and return and I ended up losing my upgrade and no refund available, trying to contact them is very difficult as the customer service is so bad. I can understand changing my ticket and making me wait at the airport for 27 hours but no refund is really bad. I also tried to save my air miles with their rubbish app but all I get is a message saying they will contact me but two weeks later no news just loads of rubbish emails trying to sell me more things. I’d advise everyone to choose another airline."

Ground staff at KUL MAS transfer counter advised that MAS do not provide compensation for hotel stay nor transportation cost to hotel, and I'm expected to contact my own insurance agency for claims. While airlines reserve the rights to cancel and reschedule itineraries, I find MAS rescheduling insensitive and unreliable."

✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur,May 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,4,yes,9,"  Probably one of the best experience I ever had with Malaysia Airlines. Flew out LHR-KUL on 1st May in business cabin. Priority check- in was superb at LHR, whole process took less than 5 mins - boarding pass and bag tags printed, documents checked, i.e. passport, MySejahtera app, status of vaccination. Boarding was smooth, no queues at the jet bridge (separate jet bridge for premium passengers). Greeted by crew and guided to my seat. Welcome drinks was offer selection juices and water. About ten minutes later, second round of pre departure drinks was offer and this time is a champagne. Crew took our order for main course and dessert just before take off. Once airborne, crews come around with amenity kit and slippers. Soon after, water is served and drinks from the bar (soft and alcoholic drinks). Malaysia Airlines signature appetiser satay was excellent as always. I can’t fault catering from LHR as their meal was delicious. I had braised beef cheeks and chocolate cake. Two hours and 30 minutes before landing second meal is served and I had nasi lemak for my main. MH also provide dine at anytime for those who are hungry throughout the flight (from noodles, cold or hot sandwiches, light snacks and cheese board). IFE was pretty good, especially for new release movies and varieties of decent film and series, good selection of musics. Monitor touch screen very responsive. Sat on 8A which is the last row of the main section of the business class, I thought it going to be very noisy due to the galley and lavatory just right behind me but I have to say it hardly disturb me. What makes this flight so special was the cabin crews. Each and everyone of them have their own character and yet maintaining their professionalism. Crew members replica with MH slogan “Malaysian Hospitality begins with us”. So well done MH."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Bangkok via Kuala Lumpur,May 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  OK so this review, is actually for a flight that hasn't happened yet, however as there is no option for booking complaints here, I have posted this. So in 2020 like many, we had a holiday cancelled, Malaysians refund policy was different depending on which phone clown you got hold of, we decided given we had paid for it, and Malaysia Airlines being government owned we would hold the refund and take the credit. 2020 came and went 2021, and then in 2022 a new hope arrived, I contacted the agent at first to be told they couldn't find our booking, nor the advance seat selections we paid for, few phone calls later they found them, we they were told that the ticket had been changed to an open ticket not a credit, so we couldn't actually use the money we paid, but rather they would book us onto the leg we used, now on initial thought it wasn't a terrible idea, however the current price was far less than we paid, I questioned this and was hung up on , I called back waited the customary 35 mins and told that the ticket was to be booked exactly the same way originally booked, I asked given that it is some $300 cheaper now, can we be credited the difference, I was told no. I asked ok can we have additional luggage to the value, I was told not, I think found that given it was an open ticket rebooked - we couldn't have access to the upgrade option everyone else gets, phone call after phone call to these people has been fruitless, we will likely simply not show up, as the airfare isn't refundable, and frankly we will never fly with them again, the worst customer service and blatant stupid policy ever."

It took my partner 3hours to change it back to 2hours using the website. We tried ringing but gave up. However that was the only problem. Flight from London was on-time. Staff were super friendly and the meals served were just fine. Arrived at KUL ahead of time and the transfer was seamless. The airplane to Melbourne was quite old but clean and functional. I was satisfied with food selections. I'm glad we remained with Malaysia as we were thinking of Qantas however judging how far Qantas has slipped failing to transport economy baggage on London flights etc we were glad to stick with Malaysia Airlines.

When was Travelling to Kathmandu from KL after arriving from Melbourne.  There was no blankets or pillow in the economy class whereas there were in Business class. I have travelled through other airlines and this is not the case. It all depended on the fact that if you could speak for yourself and ask for one in English otherwise you are just sitting there in cold.  Whilst returning, again no blankets, rude staff and my flight was delayed by more than an hour and my transit was for little over 2 hours, when I expressed my concern to the staff, they told me that once I land in KL ground staff will help and swiftly take us to our gate. As I expected no ground staff present at all, I had 45 mins till my flight took off, ran around to search for my gate in that big airport and finally made it 10 mins before they closed the gate. As I was resting in the flight, no attempt to wake me up for my food, they just left my food there. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur,April 2022,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1," Singapore to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur. Never flying MAS ever again. Perhaps they’d like to let us know when they can fly instead of have us book, only to be cancelled/ rescheduled. I initially booked a flight from SG-KUL-MEL, naturally coordinating around the dates I’ve booked. They rescheduled the flight to a day earlier which was inconvenient but somewhat workable. However, I had to personally postpone my trip so I rebooked it for 2 weeks later. My initial flight from SG to KUL was 5.30 pm with a 3 hour+ layover before flying to MEL at 10.10 pm. At 2.30 pm on the day of the flight, they notified that it is to be rescheduled to 6.30 pm. Since it was the public holidays, I decided to go to the airport 3 hours before my flight anticipating a long queue. While checking in, I was notified that my flight was rescheduled to 7.55 pm. However, at 7.55 pm, it could be seen that the plane just landed and passengers were just departing. This meant a further delay before eventually taking off past 8.30 pm. I landed in KUL 20 mins before my flight to MEL and as a result, had to scramble and run to the next gate. I was fortunate enough to make it and when I was seated, was told we were delayed because 16 passengers on a flight from Mumbai connecting in KUL was also delayed. We eventually departed more than 30 mins past the scheduled time. Upon arriving, I was told that they can’t locate my bag and suspect that it’s still in KUL. Absolutely disappointing experience. MAS has always been a mediocre airline but I’ve always supported it because it was our local pride. However, given the recent complaints, I hope you eventually lose all your customers as you’ve failed to treat your paying customers with the same respect and love they’ve shown you. Separate from the timetable, the food was absolutely disappointing. We were not given a choice and the food was barely hot. I remember the days when the food would arrive piping hot. Breakfast was supposed to be ‘chicken pie’ but was actually cheap cold stale bread with some chicken bits on it. Absolutely disgusting for the price paid on this flight. I will never fly MAS again and can only hope they stop their cancellation scams."

They changed the second leg of the trip Kuala Lumpur to Hanoi to 8th May and left the first leg of the trip as such. They refused to fix it and didn't offer cash refund. They gave me options to change to a different day, but have to pay additional $275 to get that one. Such a scam. People should stay away from this airline."

Quick and effective with many counters finally opened in KLIA compared to my previous flight with them. Boarding was fine, nothing out of the ordinary (Although it's great to see more passengers aboard since the pandemic). Hygiene kit and headset was provided to every passengers. The hygiene kit can be obtained during boarding at the front galley (inside the kit is a face mask and an alcohol wipe), while headset was put on each seat, wrapped in plastic wrap. The seat was decent (considering its over 5 years old) and the headset was also decent (could be better). The IFE system was (as always) functional but less responsive. The entertainments were great, but the movie that I watched don't have many subtitles options (Only mandarin subtitles was displayed, but I can't read it). The in-flight meal was either Nasi Lemak or Chicken Noodles, I had both and I would say the Nasi Lemak is better (8/10) while the Chicken Noodle is mediocre (6/10). The only thing I got frustrated with are the cabin crews. I wanted to dispose my plastic water cup and salted peanut packet, so I waited for them to pass by. Guess what, they pass by twice and I called them and they refused to take it. What's wrong with taking the empty water cup? Luckily it was just a small water cup (I clipped it in the seat bag), otherwise my tray table would be open the whole flight."

Luckily the remote is available, otherwise I would have had to elongate my arm to touch the screen, bothering my neighbor. The food was mediocre, my friend complained the fish doesn't taste good and the chicken curry I had was fine. Other than that, the whole flight was just fine but improvements is needed in many areas."

Malaysia Airlines keeps rescheduling my flight timing until I needed to re-book with other airlines. Besides that, Malaysia Airlines will only refund me airport tax if I decide to cancel the flight (alternative timing not suitable) and go for refund, given that Malaysia Airlines is the one causing this inconvenience.

So, I had to spend thirteen hours on the bench with chilling temperature overnight.

They promised a voucher or rebooking instead but I never got a reply how to do it, it doesn't matter how many times you ask. If you try to manage your booking online, nothing ever works.  It is very hard to reach the customer service and if you get a reply it's always useless, so as they haven't even read what I wrote. There are many bad customer services but Malaysia Airlines is surely the worst of all. So if you don't want any troubles, stay away of Malaysia Airlines."

When I purchased my ticket, it didn’t give me options if I want it with the baggage or without baggage. If I knew this I would have obviously selected with baggage. Just for one baggage I ended up paying $620 which doesn’t make sense as this amount is almost the price of round trip flight. Nothing make sense. "

Airline just changed my ticket date to 4 days later, and refuse to offer any refund, even though we cannot fly on the new date. Changing the date of your ticket is like offering me another product altogether (Not what I initially wanted), and yet they refuse to make any refund. Apparently, even if they change your air ticket date to any future date, you are just supposed to accept it. Extremely unethical."

Then cancelled this second reservation and put us on another flight. They claimed that the flights had been cancelled. We then found out that they’d actually just given our paid for seats to other people on both occasions. We were then told that we could travel on either flight if we paid extra for business class. So we were scammed.
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to San Fransisco via Doha,March 2022,,,,,,,1,no,2,"  Absolute worst purchasing and refund experience. Made a booking online that was paid for but no ticket issued. Took 15mins+ on the phone for someone to pick up my call only to have them put me on hold and have the call drop. So tried again and waited another 15mins. When I explained the issue, all they could tell me was to make another payment while they refund the first one to trigger a ticket issuance in their system. However, there was no link for me to make another payment. So now my only option is to cancel my booking and wait 3 weeks for a refund. Did that, made a new booking for the exact same date, flights, and route and paid an additional RM60 only to have the same issue occur again. So wasted another hour on the phone with the contact centre - but at least this time the call centre agent managed to resolve the issue (which was a flight itinerary change in their system) and issued a ticket. But I've basically now RM5000+ (~USD1,000+) out of pocket waiting for a refund and paid RM60 more unnecessarily for having to make a new booking, and wasted 2 hours of my life. Never flying with them again."

I booked a return ticket to New Zealand from London for April 2022. They contacted me via email to say there had been a schedule change and to accept the new times. I did so as the new dates suited me ok. 2 days later I received another email asking me to accept another change, this time though the flights included 3-day layovers in KL airport when you cannot even leave the airport. I tried to contact them and spent an hour on the phone to be told they wouldn't cancel my ticket or issue me a refund. Luckily I knew that in the EU there is a law that if they change the actual flight number, so effectively canceling original booking they have to refund so I made a complaint quoting this law and they immediately changed their tune and said they could refund me. I haven't actually received the refund yet but they have promised me this should be within the next 7 days. I have found the whole process to be stressful, they have been unhelpful and after speaking to a few friends they had the exact same thing happen to them and took many months to get their money back. Also, I have done this route before with them before and it's not a pleasant experience. I will never fly with them again."

Staff at the airport counter acknowledged the error and secured me the Business Suite seat minus the service. I received a waiting time of more than 1 hour for the staff at the check in counter to check and verify my ticket. Time wasted in having to check in my luggage at the oversized luggage counter due to the delay above. No assistance was offered to check in my luggage even though I am from Business Suite and was late for my flight. Staff at Business Suite counter walked off while attending to me halfway through. Was left to wait for 20 minutes before seeking help from other counters.  Forced to sign an indemnity form by staff at the counter absolving MAS of any responsibilities.  Entertainment system in seat 1H was down.  No Business Suite meals as my ticket was deemed to be a last minute upgrade although it was purchased in advance.  Called the toll free complaint line and was given empty promises that MAS will revert back. Got through to the CEO's email through a contact and was assigned a person in Customer Relations and Quality Assurance to sort my case out. After investigating, they stated  ""Please allow us to once again clarify that the payment collected for MYR 35,593.00 was for the upgrade from Economy Class to Business Class and not for Business Suite."". According to him, ""Regrettably, the agent being fairly new at our Global Contact Centre had unintentionally advised Mr. Teoh that the ticket was on a ‘First Class Business seat’ although she had meant to advise that the ticket was actually on ’Business Class seat’."". This is misrepresentation of sales and is a fraud! I was offered 30000 Enrich points as a ""goodwill gesture"".  After further investigation, they concluded that my ticket was issued wrongly and the correct ticket is a Business Suite ticket.  When I asked if I could be compensated in another manner instead of points, the response I got was ""We are offering this compensation to you in good faith and we will not be pursuing this matter further. If you feel otherwise you may proceed with your necessary Statutory rights, of which we will defend accordingly."" So, not only you issued me a wrong ticket, you can't conduct a proper investigation, you have no sense of responsibility to explain why the outcome of the investigation is different and your plan is to challenge your Business Suite passenger to court?

First, I have booked the flight for February 12, 2022 but on January 26 I received a notification that my flight was cancelled ""due to recent developments/movement control restrictions enacted to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic"". No channel of contact was offered, and I had to find out myself that the only way to contact the airline regarding the issue is the phone hotline in Malaysia - very convenient, considering the 5-minute robotic prompts of ""press one"" type and the charges for international calls. After that I was assured that the flight could be rescheduled to February 19, 2022, so I went with that - only to receive another notification on February 3, 2022 that this flight is cancelled due to the same reasons.

Received an email 6 days before departure that my whole flight was cancelled and was reschedule August 8, 2021. However the third sector from Doha to Chicago was not confirmed. I called many times and asked customer services what can they do? They all said just go there and wait if there anyone cancelled their flight then you can go. The other way is to change to open ticket? Why would I want to spend a few thousand for a ticket and made it Open ticket? Ask for cancellation, Customer service said here is a US200 penalty for each ticket. That is US400. First you cancel my flight but I check Qatar is still flying on the same day. Postpone my flight to another day but cannot confirmed the 3rd sector of my trip. Ask me to write and have to wait for 7 to 14 days to have someone to look into this matter. Now that I cannot make my trip and there is no flight for the next 7 days or more. I think the whole experience with Mas airline is terrible and I have made more than 10 calls and most of them hang up in the middle of the call as they couldn’t help me in anyway. I have been a loyal and support using Mas airline for most of my trips. But this one is truly a very disappointing one. Why do you sell the tickets when you cannot commit to delivering them. I was forced to cancel my tickets as they cannot provide any tickets for me so I have to rebook two other tickets to make the trip. The refund take up to 3 to 4 months. I am really disgusted that I still have to pay for penalty for cancellation where the airline cannot fulfil its services to their customer. It was a horrible experience that the airline has put me through the hassle of hotel and transport cancellation and rearrangement."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Kuala Lumpur,January 2022,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," MAS used to be somewhat a national pride for Malaysia but as of now I would not recommend anyone to fly with Malaysia Airlines as they are taking bookings for flights they have no intention of flying under the pretense of COVID. I booked a flight last month to KUL which was promptly cancelled by the airline less than 24 hours later, and the airline refused to rebook me on an alternative flight. I had to rebook with SQ, while my money is stuck with MH as they refuse to refund. I will be lodging a complaint with MAVCOM. "

With West Australian borders closed for 2020 and 2021, there is no way we could have travelled - yet they refuse to give our money back and sorry is only reply I get from customer service . This is beyond frustrating."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur) to Kuching,December 2021,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,3,yes,8,"  Check-in was a little disappointing because the queue was very long but only a couple of check-in counters were available. Priority check-in counter was not easy to spot without any signage or marker. The boarding procedure was great as they board passengers from the last row to the front (business class passengers is prioritized obviously). Cabin crew were satisfying, although some just stares at you as you walk through the aisle looking for your seat. Since it is a domestic flight, blanket and pillow is not provided except headset. The headset was the same headset I used over 5 years ago so it would be great if they change it to a better headset. The IFE system is decent, although it is not responsively occasionally. The entertainment content is great and up to date. In this flight, the food choices were Noodle with Chicken and Nasi Lemak. I chose the noodle and it was decent. The portion is enough for me but the sauce used is a little bland. Usually the meal will come with a few snacks, but this time only the salted peanut is provided together with a water bottle. The beverage choices were great, although my favourite guava juice was not available. The seat was decent, but it is the same seat I sat 5 years ago. There was no changes to the seats, so it is a little disappointing. If there are any changes needed, it would be changing the leather seat to a smoother and softer seat with headrest. Overall, it is a decent flight but some things need to change because it is outdated."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Manila via Kuala Lumpur,June 2021,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Had a booking cancelled and been waiting for almost 7 months now for my refund. The reason for cancellation is not even my fault, they rescheduled my 3rd flight and advanced it by one day making the whole trip useless as I would've arrived at Kuala Lumpur to transit to another flight that already took off a day before I even arrive. Never given other options, and it looks like they also do not want to give my money back. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bengaluru to Bali via Kuala Lumpur,December 2021,,,,,,,1,no,2,"  This review is related to booking and cancelling process and not actual travel of Malaysian Airlines. I had raised a booking for May 2022 to travel from Bangalore to Bali with my family. Due to other reasons and also COVID guidelines of quarantine, decided to cancel the ticket. First i had to call the helpdesk which is Malaysian number and had to wait for 30-40 mins twice to get connected. After that the support person says I am eligible for refund but it will take 3 to 6 months for refund and also the refund money they said they cannot say and asked to call again after a month to check status. Each month i need to follow up to get my money back is what it looks like. Now i am not sure if i will get my money back and if yes by when is still a mystery. This is the first time i had booked this airline and this information sharing to others to ensure they are aware of this issue and be careful choosing this airline. Also the support team said they cannot send any email on cancelling as well, asked to check in airline website the status will be cancelled. So now i am confused what is the proof of refund?"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Chennai via Kuala Lumpur,December 2021,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I purchased return flights to go from Melbourne to Chennai for December 2021. The tickets were already expensive at $2,800 return but I have been waiting to see my parents back home in India and was prepared to pay the high fares. I tried for 2 hours to book tickets directly through the Malaysian Airlines website but I kept getting error. I therefore had to book the tickets via 3rd party - Trip.com Then the airlines canceled the flights, after which I contacted Trip.com for a refund. I was told the airline would not refund any money and only provide a travel voucher to be used before Dec 2022. I then contacted the airline and after much persuasion and heated discussion the agent agreed to charge a cancellation fee of $200. I questioned this charge, as the flight was cancelled by the airline so I do not understand why I should be the one to pay a penalty. The agent said this policy is mentioned in my ticket booking. I asked him to direct me to where I can view this policy. There was no cancellation policy within my booking. I requested the agent to send me a screenshot which I could see and confirm. He said he was unable to email me anything. I have since spent hours and much of my frustration talking/emailing Trip.com and the airlines but to no avail. It is very clear that the airlines and travel agents such as Trip.com are easily abdicating any responsibility and are taking advantage by fleecing customers like me. The airline says sorry, you didn't book through us and Trip.com says its the airline decision. Even if I did rebook for later, the tickets are expected to be cheaper than $2,800 certainly. So the airline have made money by cancelling the flight, the travel agents have made money and we as customers desperate to see family are at the mercy of these entities. "
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Auckland to Mumbai via Kuala Lumpur,December 2020,,,,,,,2,no,1,"  We had tickets booked by Malaysia Airlines to fly from Auckland NZ, to Mumbai, India during Dec 2020. Due to the pandemic the flights from NZ were cancelled. We now need to travel to India in December this year, however I understand the flights are not operational to NZ route. But dealing with their customer service team is a nightmare. First of all there is no option at all for a refund or a partial refund minus the booking fees or whatever. Secondly I have hardly had any responses to my queries about my refund on compassionate grounds as the only reason we need to travel is due to personal family reasons. We would prefer flying them as we already have tickets, however if they aren't operating flights, they should at least partially refund our money so we can make other arrangements. So far I have 0 responses to my messages to them. Their call centre staff were unable to help me with our flights as they are unsure when the route will begin operating. Now we have booked our tickets with another airline to travel in Dec with the unwanted Malaysia airlines tickets still on our name which they only keep extending so we can rebook another date, even though we do not have travel plans in the future after this date. Now it is not my problem that they aren't operating on the dates we need to fly on. Again I would have preferred using them but since they aren't operating flights to NZ, I am stuck with an extra ticket to India on which I may not travel anytime soon in the foreseeable future. Thanks Malaysia airlines for nothing. Customer service gets a 0 for ignoring all my messages. Will never choose to travel with them ever again. Happy to pay extra for other airlines and get the assurance of customer service."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Bengaluru via Kuala Lumpur,December 2020,,,,,,,1,no,2,"  Stay away from Malaysia Airlines I have booked tickets in March 2020 from MEL to BLR for a family of 4 and the travel is cancelled due to pandemic. After a long struggle and multiple calls to Airlines, they issued travel vouchers. I thought I could use these vouchers next time I travel. But, it remained as a dream. Surprisingly they issued MH-Evouchers when things are settled and deducted A$150 for each ticket. In addition, one of E-voucher is not redeemable. Prolonged waiting time and multiple calls each day to customer care doesn't yield any desired results. The customer care is really useless, every-time during the call they go through all details and comes up with standard answer- 'We are sorry sir, we know that it's an issue but we can't do much about it' This is going for multiple hours for the past 7 days. I haven't expected such unprofessional & below standard response. Even, the ticket prices are tripled now when things are slowly getting normal. The website is either slow or doesn't work at all most of the times."

Keep away from this unethical airline. The audacity to still sell flights from Australia while hundreds of customers are waiting for their refunds. The mentality of those managing the customer service, public relations and management is a warning sign to safely stayaway from booking flights with them."

I run a small hotel in Sri Lanka and I gave everyone who cancelled with me a full refund because it was the honest & right thing to do, now I am in no position to go on holiday so the money would be big help to me. You can steal from people once but they will never return. I would expect more from a national carrier, shame on you."

Flight got canceled and I received a single email, but then they still tried to check me in via sms? Had to call to confirm if it was actually cancelled. Later I was told that they will deduct over 200 USD as admin charges on a refundable ticket! And when I asked for a timeline for a refund - they don’t have a time line, there is a minimum wait of over 8 months. Seriously? At least provide us with something. This is extremely unprofessional."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kathmandu to Adelaide via Kuala Lumpur,March 2020,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Worst airline experience when covid hit back in March. I was in Nepal and had a flight booked for 23 March (it was 19 March). Heard a rumour that KTM airport was going to close in 24 hours. Went straight to Malaysia Airlines office the next morning. Was told that “yes the flight is cancelled however our system has yet to be updated so you will have to pay the difference and claim it back later”. I had no choice and they knew it, the flight they were moving me to was to depart in 3 hours, so I had to get back to the hotel, pack and rush to the airport. So my original flight was already double the normal price and I then got charged that and a bit more again... so paid quadruple the normal price in total.  I went round and round in circles for 8 months where they even claimed not to have an office in KTM (I sent them a photo of it via google to disprove this particular lie). So, as with many others, no refund as promised or travel voucher or anything. "

Called every week to check refund weekly but every time told in the process, can’t tell how long before I get refund. Then a month later told me to fill in bank detail again. No reason given. I paid by credit card , their email message is - due to insolvency of payment partner Wirecard where customer purchased their tickets with non Malaysian Ringgit were unfortunately being rejected/ hold under Wirecard. Therefore refund will need process through bank transfer. A lot of lies, from other complaints online, don’t believe Malaysian airlines have intention of refunding customers. Poor service will never fly with this airline. The call centre will just lied & said they don’t due with refund, can’t help. "

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Miri to Bali via Kota Kinabalu,August 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  We have booked 5 flights with Malaysia Airlines in October this year, economy and business class. In the mean time we received approx. 20 changes in the scheduling. Some flights changed a few minutes, 3 of the 5 flights were completely rescheduled: 1 flight 2 days later, 1 flight 1 day later and 1 flight 1 day earlier. There was a very quick reply after a request for reimbursement: not applicable while extra ordinary circumstances. They simply refuse any flexibility, no compensation, no hotel. Nothing. The policy of Malaysian is clearly to use the uncertainty to earn a lot of money, because people are forced to rebook or cancel flights. Their extended flexibility-policy allows one to rebook flights by 31 December and travel by 30 June 2021. It is a very short period if you are from overseas. Having a pretty complex itinerary, there is only one thing we can do: cancel,and never book again with Malaysia Airlines. A zero star rating in the review is unfortunately not possible."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,,July 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1," Malaysia Airlines are providing vouchers instead of refunding flights impacted by corona virus.

Great source of entertainment with a large screen which is responsive.  For a 7 hour plus flight, they gave out so many snacks ranging from Japanese style to Malaysian style.

I was trying to get a voucher because of COVID19 through the booking agent (mytrip.com) with no success so finally contacted Malaysia Airlines direct. The representative was very helpful, no problem that we had booked through an agent, and processed the voucher request immediately. I had it in my inbox within 3 hours of the phone call. And, to my surprise, we were awarded a credit 20% higher in value than the original booking. Now, this is a really responsive airline! First, I did not have to wait until the flight was due to depart in order to get the voucher, and they have been very flexible and generous in their response! Well done Malaysia Airlines."

No questions, if the flight on the next day is good for me, nothing at all, you fly the next day. So I wrote to them an email to avoid significant roaming charges. In my first email I asked if they are going to provide any accommodation or any kind of compensation because i booked a hotel in my destination and now I was going to lose a night I paid for plus i needed another hotel in Kuala lumpur. They replied they are not going to provide anything.  No customer care, no intentions of help or even replying to your email. I lost 200 euros, because it was for 2 persons.

When we arrived at the terminal, we checked in via the kiosk, only our luggage tags were printed. we were told to go to the ticketing counter to get the boarding passes. Upon reaching the counter, staff informed us that passengers with Malaysian passports weren't allowed to fly out and therefore she won't be able to print out the boarding pass for us. Unhappy with what she said , i proceded to call Immigration Malaysia on 03 87763681 stationed in KLIA, I spoke to an officer who said since we are permanent residents and with long term visa, we should be able to fly out. Taking his word I approached staff  again to inform her of what was told to me. She wasn't happy with what I did, so she insisted on taking all our documents over to the Immigration Malaysia herself. According to her, she went over to counter 23 of immigration and consulted an officer stationed there, who according also confirmed that we could not fly as our documents were insufficient and we didn't have the PR Card. The documents that we had on us was issued by Immigration Australia with their logo and crest of the federal government on it, In spite of that, she still insists that that paperwork was insufficient and again insisted on the PR Card. I informed her that we were just granted our visas, and told her that we weren't going to Australia for a holiday but to return home. Staff again took matters into her hands and even went to the extend of calling up Australian Immigration to confirm the authenticity of the documents and of our claims of being residents. In spite of getting the confirmation from the Australian Immigration, she insisted that she won't be able to issue the boarding pass and refused to put in a word to Immigration Malaysia to confirm that we could fly out. The third time I called the Immigration Malaysia number, this time this officer said that we could not fly out. I told her that i have already checked in and that the kiosk printed out my luggage tags, to which she said we still can't fly out, so i explained to her that that action of checking in needed to be undone but she just brushed it off and told us to go to counter 3. After 4 and the half hours or so of dealing with this woman and the contradicting feedbacks from the immigration officers, we headed to counter 3 for a refund. An young man with a Hospitality T-shirt approched us and saw the visa grants that i was holding and he called out to another lady to help us out, This Good Samaritan refused to give up but insisted on dragging us back to see staff.  This good Samaritan helped us by approaching the Immigration Malaysia and managed to get their approval. They went on to MH office to get our boarding passes. When we checked in, staff left a ""not allowed to travel"" in the system and left w/out undoing her mistake."

Malaysia Airlines economy product is almost always good. Though it does depend on the crew. On these two flights the crew were excellent, especially the return sector. Above and beyond in friendliness and ""can do"" attitude to requests. Looking great in their uniforms. Food was good. The main meal always feels a bit small for me. And one was served just a degree or two above cold but the flight attendant got me a warmer one off another trolley. MAS take note - we westerners do not like hot food served any other way but piping hot. Especially during covid19 concerns. The snacks served at the end of the journeys were excellent and hot. Greatly improved from previous journeys. Nice touch is crew walking the aisles with a tray full of beers on departure from Sydney. Since the passengers are Australians or Indians, its greatly appreciated. Dont expect it on departure from KL. IFE quite good. Seats getting on in years but Ok. Cabin colours very pleasant. Both flights ontime or early.  Often offering very reasonable fares for the quality of the product, I would highly recommend."

My husband passed away on our trip to India and as we both had a return ticket from India to Australia, I requested for his ticket to be changed to my daughter’s name so she could accompany me back home. From Malaysia Airlines, there was no level of compassion shown - I was not asking for a free ticket. I was ready to pay for the penalty on the name change but under no circumstances did they consider my request; they neither cancelled my late husband’s ticket and at a time of loss, with the stress of the funeral arrangements, my family had to stress about getting a new ticket for my daughter to travel back with me. A death in the family is a deeply distraught moment in a persons life - some level of compassion goes a long way in showing support and assistance, this process with the airline has made me rethink of ever using them."

I made a cancellation recently because my workplace made an announcement that travelling isn't advisable at this time due to the spread of Wuhan/Corona virus. Since I was going through KL to go to Penang, I thought this was wise. A friend travelling to Penang from South Korea also cancelled her tickets, and she did it a few days after me. And she got pver 70% refund of her tickets with a $100 cancellation fee. The flight was about 3 weeks away at that point. What seems bizarre to me is this: I cancelled my ticket days before this friend and out of the $513, I only received $31. When I wrote to customer care, this particular staff kept stressing on their flight advisory for flight to and from China. The staff handling this issue kept dodging my request for this breakdown of cancellation charges, and never really answered my questions. "

Malaysia Airlines currently flies A330-200 which are former Air Berlin aircrafts. Business class seats come with full lie-down flat bed which is quite comfortable to get some rest especially on a midnight flight. The aircraft is a little aged but is still well kept. Business class passengers have access to priority check-in and boarding at Perth Airport, and access to Qantas International Lounge. Onboard the aircraft, the Malaysia Airlines crew has definitely shown me a true Malaysian Hospitality. The crew takes the time to know our names, and greet each passengers politely, e.g. Mr Smith. The highlight of Malaysia Airlines business class flight is their signature satay and the crew spoiled me today with a generous serve of the satay and generous portion of the peanut sauce. For dinner, I chose the roasted chicken which is cooked beautifully and to perfection. After dinner, most passengers have lied down their bed and slept. We were each given a pillow and a blanket. Before arriving, the crew went around for another serve of beverages. I chose the teh tarik (literally translates as pull tea) which is a signature beverage among the local.

It is tiny gesture like this that makes me walk away not only being well fed but truly experiencing what Malaysian Hospitality is all about."

They lost my baggage and its been 2 days now and I still haven't received my baggage. I have been calling the baggage service since past 2 days and no one is responding back nor replying to my emails or voicemails. The flights were not cheap even, I paid Christmas fares.

I flew from Auckland to London today, with stopover at Kuala Lumpur. The Auckland flight was first delayed by 2 hours due to engineering issues. This caused me to miss my connecting flight. We were issued a replacement flight, but had to wait from 9am to 11.30pm to get on this flight. I told them I need to get on an earlier flight due to work. There has to be an earlier flight to London during a 15 hour period! Then what I experienced was the most unhelpful, unapologetic customer service at the Transfer Desk. They lied to me that there was no flight earlier (there was). The worst is the so called manager - when the front desk briefed him on the issue, decided to ignore us and walked to another line to talk to other customers - and the next available flight for me was in less than an hour! When I finally spoke to him, he asked me 'what is the flight number you want to be put on?' What a ridiculous question coming from the airline. By the time they faffed around 1 hour later, I wouldn't get on the earlier flight - I doubt they ever intended to get me on it with their attitude. During my 1 hour of waiting, I heard a girl screaming at them that ""I already bought 3 tickets"", and she still couldn't fly. Two others said their flight was delayed but they were not notified. A few others not offered hotel when they had to wait from 9 to 4pm. Very disappointing customer service, the only nice thing was the front desk girl who had helped me to with directions to the airport hotel, after feeling bad for the actions of her superiors."

I waited in line for long time, the economy lane gone more faster, then when I asked the lady at check in why it is taking too long for business class, she shouted at me, she said we have problems and all are business class, not only you. If she said it politely I wouldn’t have written this, but shouting is very bad response."

I asked for a glass of water that was served from a jug and the water was warm. The aircraft was far from clean. We used wipes to clean the arm rests and the wipes ended up far from white.  I will go back to Malaysia but I would rather go via a connection with another airline than directly with MAS and I'm sorry for all the good people that work for Malaysian.

I booked 4 flights in April 2019 to travel in January 2020 and within weeks of booking Malaysia Airlines changed 2 of them to different days and times. As they had not changed the other 2 flights they would not give me a full refund if I cancelled. The new flight times cost me an extra £250 in hotels, but even more frustrating the new flight schedule was £600 cheaper than my original itinerary, but Malaysia Airlines would not offer any reduction. After many months of dealing with an inconsiderate company they gave me a token number of air miles. This compensation cannot be used to book seats and is not even enough to get access to their airport lounge. Their Customer Service is so poor; a web site contact only; delayed responses; being pushed from one department to another and just an overall disregard for the customer."

Meal consisted of salad, main, desert and cheese and warm roll. More drinks followed and throughout the 14.5 hour flight or were available at the rear of the aircraft. Breakfast offered 2 hours prior to landing with again 2 choices and hot drinks. Throughout the flight the toilets were cleaned frequently.

I have flown Malaysia Airlines business class many times due to needing to join my airline from KL. I would love to say they have improved however the sad truth is, they haven't. I would have to say that the Golden Lounge in KL was excellent, with attentive staff and great showers and food. The flight was prompt and on time. The crew seemed a bit remote and did not engage. I almost felt like I was imposing on them to ask for anything. The food was average and the satays were now down the 4 sticks instead of 6. The wine I had was average and one glass I had was corked. I really hope Malaysian get their act together as it is a good option out of Australia. There would be minimal cost as most of the issues seem to stem from a lack of customer-focused service."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Sydney to Kuala Lumpuir,December 2019,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4,yes,8," Malaysia Airlines is currently flying its flagship aircraft A350-900 XWB between Kuala Lumpur and Sydney. Business class passengers have priority check-in and boarding privileges, and in Sydney passengers will be given express security screening pass as well which is helpful. At Sydney Airport, they do not make any announcement about boarding so passengers are advised to go to the gate at the time stated on your boarding pass. Upon boarding, the Malaysia Airlines cabin crew are really warm and friendly. Business class passengers are welcomed with juices and cold towel. The seat on A350 is pretty spacious with different compartments for your personal items such as iPad and iPhone. The seat has 3 modes: upright, relax and lie-flat bed, and they are quite comfortable to sleep in on a long haul flight. Passengers are given a pillow and blanket, as well as amenity kit. No pyjamas are supplied. Malaysia Airlines consistently deliver their delicious signature satay and I was lucky to be given two servings of satay. For lunch, I had Tasmanian Salmon, Chef Nell’s Rib Eye and seasonal fruit. The rib eye was not cooked to tender (meat does not fall off your fork) which is a let-down. The taste for both my entree and main are well done. The inflight entertainment OS is pretty smooth and responsive. However, it has very limited range of choices. I have completed SYD-KUL earlier in 2019 and one of the senior crew had such a really high benchmark in terms of service and hospitality, and thus comparing this experience to my previous one, I am less impressed with the service. The flight was overall uneventful, and the crew was friendly and responsive to most passengers"

This was by far the worst flight experience I have ever had. The level of service was way below what you expect from even an economy flight in other airlines. The airplane was untidy and messy. The business crew kept changing and they never happened to take orders or requests properly. To start with, there was no headset available and as a result of that I couldn't use any entertainment! The cabin was so cold and there was no blanket available; I had to beg couple of crew and ask few times to get a single small blanket! I pre-ordered my main dish online the day before the flight; which was never delivered to me! I asked one of the crew about the dinner but didn't get a clear answer or explanation. I presume that the food was either eaten by crew or another passenger or never existed. This was unbelievable. Adding to the list, the toilets were constantly engaged or locked by crew themselves for no reason. It was a real challenge to find a vacant toilet during the flight. This was a disappointing experience. For such a long flight and a business ticket, the service was extremely poor. I will never try Malaysia Airlines and would suggest you not to waste your money there and simply go for another airline."

Flew SGN-KUL-PNH and back mid December 2019 on their old B737-800 which are about to have passed their silver weddings. Check-in in SGN was a breeze as usual – I came earlier and found an open counter from the previous flight and - vupti - got all my 4 BPs issued instantly which allowed me early lounge access in the Le Saigonnais which is new and very nice though not world class. Onboard, smooth travels and nice, huge, decliner, classic, comfortable business class seats. Up to 16 seats in business which were full or almost full on all sectors. I ordered special meal which was delivered on all 4 sectors. Tried also a non-special meal on all 4 sectors. Food acceptable and 3 choices and menu cards were handed out. No alcohol, but you can bring your own discretely and they’ll accept it. 3 of 4 flights on time (first leg was 15 Minutes late). Golden Lounges in KLIA are fabulous. Slept overnight in their Quiet Area. They have discontinued their subscription on Supersport disallowing access to most important sports events on their TVs. Noddle shop is a hit! Transit in PNH was very easy and I could pass in 3 Minutes just showing BPs and go through a security screening. The Plaza Premium is a fine, 3rd part lounge that Oneworld Airlines contract to. Extremely many Chinese citizens in the lounge, likely more than 75%. This is a recent development compared to 1-2 years ago. The flights were cheap and in flexible D-class (business). They rendered a lot of miles and 160 tier points to my British Airways membership. IFE worked fine on individual monitors with many choices. Last leg offered no IFE. Newspapers and magazines available. Gatebridges made available for all passengers at all 8 aircraft ascends and descends which was very nice and quick. The cons with MAS are few but somehow significant: Very short check-in period in regional airports is a problem. Advise to come earlier and get BPs from the check-in team at the flight prior to the one you fly with. All aircraft were narrowbody and were from last century. No alcohol available nor served unless one fly to another continent."

The entertainment was just in the name ( again they got the cheap old TV series and movies) on styled consoles.  I thought they may like to attract people with good service, food and entertainment. How wrong I was. When I asked the cabin crew if she has any snacks for dinner, even peanuts will do, she said we have none. "

As I am short and the bag was slightly wider than the baggage compartment, I failed to squeeze it in and the bag dropped on one of the business class passengers. Dispirited, I left the bag on the empty seat next to me. The staff told me it is MAS policy that the passengers put their luggage into the baggage compartment on their own. However, her kindness and compassion surpassed the policy, made an exception to help me get the bag into the compartment. The flight was later delayed by bad weather and circled above the thunderstorms for an additional 30 minutes. Desperately needed the toilet; she saw I was extremely uncomfortable and allowed me a small kindness with concern for safety and advise to be quick as it was a little bumpy. Balancing small acts of kindness, safety and work flexibility in rigid policies/rules is sometimes tricky, but kindness precedes and should be credited i.e. not taken for granted. It really makes a positive difference to the service provided. Well done!"

Delay itself not the airline's fault, but there was no information given  throughout the long wait between the delay and the pushback announcements. Meal service was good, with a full bar and a separate dessert course. Primary drawback was the Boeing 738 I had on the outbound, which Malaysia Airlines uses for 1 of its 3 daily HKG flights. Think high-density seating and no adjustable headrests in Y. One thing I'll remember about the inbound leg is the two FAs on my aisle: one was green and on her first A330 flight, the other a seasoned vet with no qualms demonstrating tough love!"

The boarding gate was at T2 with a short walking distance. After boarding, cabin crew offered me a hot tower and drink. The onboard service was very good as there was a local selection of food to choose from even a short 1 hour journey only. However, no hot drink served due to light turbulance. The seat was quite spacious and comfort. IEF came with larger screen and latest content throughout the flight. The cabin crew was friendly and attentive. Upon arrival in KLIA, I able to disembark quickly and have my time walking toward the baggage collection area. However, my flight baggages was delayed due to some technical issue.

Both flights departed and arrived late - the return trip by 90 minutes. There was no notification in the lounge in Kuala Lumpur until the last minute, necessitating two enquiries by me at the front counter, and resulting in chaos at the gate. At least the captain apologised at the beginning and end of the flight. The attendants on the way over were very pleasant and professional, on the way back a tad curt. Food and wine was of good but not stand-out quality. The seat reclines to be fully flat and was comfortable. The selection of movies was extremely limited, almost embarrassingly so, and bespeaks cost-cutting. Baggage appropriately was at the front of the carousel on both legs. The overall sense was of an airline desperately trying to be premium but with a product in line with its entertainment options - somewhat B-grade."

The cabin was looking tired and rundown same goes with the cabin crew. Why is MAS still putting on such old aircraft on its international route and definitely will give a bad impression from the customers. You wouldn't know which aircraft you will be flying until the moment you step into the cabin. It doesnt match the money value that customer was paying for. "

The good thing about Malaysia Airlines is that prices are fairly reasonable and it remains that way even till two to three days before departure, as long as there is availability of course, which makes last minute flying with them great. Also, they do not quite charge a premium on one-way tickets (i.e. The cost of a one way ticket is approximately half the cost of a return ticket), so it really helps when flying multiple destinations. Other than that, it is quite an average airline with average legroom, below-average food, service, average IFE, etc. Their fleet is rather dated and they tend to use more narrowbodies, but if you're lucky you might get their A350, A330 or A380. This certainly isn't my first time flying with them, and they're a barely-meeting-expectations airline on the whole. That said, Kuala Lumpur is a relatively easy airport to transit around, and their on-time performance is fairly decent. I appreciate and would recommend them for their flexibility especially for a last-minute traveler around Asia."

I was hoping that they could wait for me but only to be given the boarding pass for a subsequent flight which was almost 12 hours later! Because of the delay, I had to cancel all my engagements in Shanghai for the day.

My $50 flight from PEN to KUL just added a $100 baggage fee for a 20kg bag."

AKL-KUL A330-200 With a 2-4-2 seat configuration it was perfect for 2 people traveling together. The seating had less legroom than the A350 but having an aisle seat alleviates the issue some what. Beer and peanuts immediately after take-off which is a nice touch, and then straight into meal service which was decent for an economy meal with more beer to boot. Good range of recent movies to watch, and a USB port to charge your devices. KUL-NRT A350-900 On-board wifi is shoddy at best, and definitely not worth the price. Flight had more legroom and better recline making for a somewhat better (attempt at) sleep. On the flight back however my entertainment screen only showed audio options when other passengers had movies fine. I had stuff downloaded on my phone so this was no issue, however buyer beware.

I was a little hesitant to fly Malaysian Airlines to start with but the price point was too good to refuse. The airline uses the Qantas Business Lounge in SYD was disappointing, food options were lacking and the decor was poor, needs a serious update. The satellite lounge in KUL however was great and am looking forward to spending 5hrs there on the way home. Now on to the seat and service, if you can get a throne seat or if traveling as a couple the middle seats then I don’t think you will disappointed. Service was great, the Satay’s amazing and well the food was better then I hoped for (my partner used the book the chef option and I think I am cancelling that for the way home). They aren’t at the level of an Emirates or a Qatar but for the price I paid I can’t say a bad thing."

Came to Jakarta by Sri Lankan and continued to Saigon with Malaysia Airlines over Kuala Lumpur where I spent the night in their Golden lounge to catch next morning 1st flight to Saigon. Smooth transit in Jakarta as I had checked in Online. Long walks in T3, about 3 km in total. They use Plaza Premium Lounge i T3: Nice lounge with panorama views in 3 directions. They use old B737 narrow-body aircraft. Both flights were on time and food was also very good with 3-4 options, though I had special meal which was nice. They have never failed to bring me my special meal which must be logistically difficult. Onboard, FAs were neat and fresh, however no wines or spirits, not even a beer can be offered yet. That small privilege was removed after the MH370 incident. However, 202 USD for 4 legs pampered with extra luggage, special meal and 4 times lounge accesses (thru FFP status) is extremely good value for money. No mileage given for Q-booking class but that is the compromise. I have had some 50+ regional flights with MH over the last 5 years and must say that I have never had serious delays or luggage delivery problems. Clear information provided, even if there should arise a delay of 10 Minutes. At times they managed to prepone my departure according to my wish (arrived in airport from transit far too early) without costs. That’s how a company should run. Another strength is the hospitable and fresh staff onboard and as well in their lounges. They only need to update and align their alcohol policy and then start to renew their regional fleet as they are about to be worn out. The strength with these ageing B737 is, however, that they have so many aircrafts enabling them to instate another quickly which is a huge joker card to keep things running should there be a technical problem."

The day after we returned I phoned to complain and they said they would attend to it but nothing happened. I called a week later and they told me I had been refunded but there was nothing in my bank account. I called another week later to be told somebody would call me, nothing happened. I called again today, a week later to be told I had been refunded but it takes 6 to 8 weeks for the payment to happen. I consider sale of the same ticket to 2 parties unacceptable plus the wait (if you can believe them) of 6 to 8 weeks ridiculous plus the fact that they never contacted me very rude If possible."

The ground staff and cabin crew were very friendly and professional in performing their duties. The flight also took off on-time. As for their in-flight entertainment (IFE), it's kind of a hit-or-miss, especially when you are flying with their 737s. My first flight (9M-FFF) had no IFE screen, but my return flight (9M-MSB) had it even though both are Boeing 737-800. In any case, the touchscreen of the IFE had a noticeable lag when you interact with it. Forget smartphone-like responsiveness on the touchscreen, I felt like I had to wait for a few seconds before the screen registered my presses. Fortunately, the IFE content had a huge library to choose from. As for the food quality, it's not bad but it's not great either. Let's just say I've had much better in-flight meals in other airlines before."

Got both two Boarding Passes issued instantly. The luggage was checked in for my next 4 legs (I had 6 to come, but they failed to manage the last two - but acceptable. As a frequent traveler I accessed Le Saigonnais lounge in Saigon and Golden Lounge in the Satellite terminal in KLIA. Both lounges are very good and hospitable. Nap area in Golden Lounge is very useful for me, I also appreciate their noodle section. Flights on time and well announced. Hot meals on board on both flights, and my special meal request was honored. Meals loaded from KLIA are always much better than those loaded from Ho Chi Minh. IFE worked fine. On both flights, I was given option to chose any seat available in economy. No mileage give as the ticket was cheap providing very high value for money especially elite travelers as the lounges make up for what may be missing on the flights. They give 45 kg. luggage allowances to One-World frequent flyers on a strongly discounted fare, that’s a gift. Still, they don’t serve any alcoholic drinks on those route, which is a shortcoming."

Oh Malaysia Airlines, why can't you be like McDonald's and offer the same standard on all routes. A350-900 from LHR to KUL is fantastic. Great plane, great lounges, great staff. Why on earth would you continue to sell the dreadful experience of A330-200 business class between KUL and AKL? It's awful. Whoever designed those hideous little BC pods clearly had no intention of staying in one for more than 4 hrs. I felt sorry for the cabin crew - who were great - they don't even have somewhere to rest and appear to hate those planes too. Some of the meals on KUL-AKL were a bit rubbish I'd also have to say (fish was pretty unpleasant) Seriously Malaysia Airlines, you need to pull those A330's, they are poor and I am actually willing to pay a little more to go with Cathay, Qatar, Emirates or Singapore just to avoid those awful seats. No storage space whatsoever, they are 'open plan' into the aisle and the bed tapers at the foot so you almost have to have your feet crossed all the time. An appalling design which is better than EC, but a far cry for usual BC standards. I want to love you Malaysian, and I do, but there are loads of competitors on this route, please scrap the A330's and lease some good planes. The A350 is great."

Boarding was reasonably efficient though main security check is done at the boarding gate but 3 lanes were open so not much of a delay. Seat 4 A in Business, which is a standard Business Class seat with direct aisle access. Offered a pre take off juice and a cold towel. Departure slightly delayed however crew offered more juice when requested. After take off Tea or coffee trolley brought around as it was a morning flight and then an excellent breakfast of Muesli, fresh fruit and toast. Soon after lunch orders were taken which I declined as I was quite full after the breakfast, however the cabin crew said I could order anytime which I thought was very good. Watched a movie and a doze in the seat for a while and then they asked if I would like to something to eat and had a meat pie with tomato sauce. Prior to landing the famous Satay was served along with a glass of champagne and we landed about 15 minutes early into Melbourne.

I asked for a glass if possible and it was delivered in a prompt manner. After take off a cold towel was handed out and then one of the highlights of this airline the satay was served! Next came a Terrine as a starter followed by my lunch which I had pre ordered. A prawn and noodle dish which was one of the best meals I have enjoyed in over 40 years of flying internationally! The wine list was very good and also the ""if your hungry"" menu was also great! The service and the staff on board were brilliant and answered the call button within seconds. Movies were limited but enough to keep me going for the 8 hour flight. Overall for the price and the great crew this flight I rate in my top 3 of all time."

My FIL had to give the staff 200 rs to the staff to get wheelchair service. Their ordeal didn't end here. After reaching Kulla Lumpur, no one came to escort my parents in wheelchair. They asked the crew to which they received the reply that they themselves had to change the flight. They had to walk to the next gate and board the next flight. Even after reaching Adelaide, my parents had to stand in the queue for immigration check for 3 hours as the airport was busy. They were not offered a wheelchair at any time.

Took four international and domestic flights with MH in July 2019: HAN-KUL-PEN and PEN-KUL-HKG, all sectors on a B738. The onboard service has been good to excellent on all these flights (i.e. the cabin crews very cooperative and approachable) and the food well-presented. The highlight of all these sectors was MH432 KUL to HKG on 30th July where the onboard service, food presentation and general guest experience exceeded all expectations: a sumptuous satay to begin with followed by a well-presented hot meal and ice cream. The Bruno Paillard as well as the Philip Shaw Chardonnay beautifully accompanied the meals on these international sectors - Malaysian Hospitality at its best, indeed. MH is still great in the air for us but, over many domestic and international flights for the past 15 years, we've become somewhat frustrated with the constant delays experienced with MH on their intra-Asian flights - we always check MH first - also experienced this time with all four sectors (20-60 min delay each). MH needs to seriously monitor their departure procedures very carefully since they seem to take such a long time in getting a flight ready even when all passengers have boarded and the luggagge has been uploaded. Still, it takes a mysterious 10-30 minutes to get a flight ready and shut the doors. Having learned this over the years, we always take MH international & domestic connections allowing us at least 2 hours at KLIA in our attempts to guarantee peace of mind. Some inefficiency is clearly there in the departure proceedings, be it domestic or international, and they haven't been able to tackle this operational problem over the years. The delays on these four sectors didn't bother us since we knew what to expect, however, we advise MH passengers not to trust too tight connections (i.e. 45 min up to 90 min) since these may simply not work out at KLIA. Otherwise, Malaysia Airlines is still good in the air with pleasant staff, tasty food and good service by a dedicated crew. Will surely fly again."

However, ground staff at KUL was quite unpleasant, with most of them looking really moody and unhelpful. Cabin crews were extremely pleasant otherwise, helpful and attentive with a smile on their face always. Narrowbody jets are used for their domestic/regional flights.

Delays can happen but there has to be a proper way to handle these things. I was asked to go to a hotel with food vouchers but immigration officers rejected to allow us to go out due to err on the boarding pass. Several times I went here and there without any meaning wasting my time.  So there has to be a proper mechanism to handle those frustrated customers without asking them to go here and there and wasting time.

There were no headphones available and on requesting for a set they were provided grudgingly to just me and the other passengers were told to wait for the flight to take off. Me and my son were not served the peanuts or snack which was randomly given. No tea or coffee was offered. On a five hour flight it is usual for the staff to walk around with a tray of water and juice. Service standards were very disappointing as compared to other airlines.

Assisted by the concierge of the hotel i stayed in their call to airport Lost & Found yielded a ""nothing found"". I kept my faith in the efficiency of MH business class and the fact that the stewardess in-charge of my row  has been one of the more experienced flight attendants I have come across and of course the in-flight manager who impressed me as a veteran in his class. As I was returning to KUL just the next day on MH126 (return leg of daily 127) all I did was to enquire again at check in counter and sure enough, my iPad was duly returned in good and proper state.  Thank you MH crew on both 127 (19 June) and 126 (21 June), for the pleasant and trustworthy flights."

Check-in at PNH was easy and quick, boarding was organised and flight departed on time. Although it is an old cabin design, it was a comfortable flight and legroom was sufficient. They offered complimentary meal and beverages on this flight. After take off passengers were offered soft drinks and peanuts followed by meal tray service consist of salad, main meal and dessert. I must say for a short haul flight it was a good service and the food was tasty. The announcement made by the flight was clear and informative. What I like the most is the announcement made to welcome Malaysian passengers home after we touched down at KLIA was indeed very special with a message. This message made every Malaysian who live abroad feel special and welcome home. I would definitely fly with Malaysia Airlines again."

I used to always choose to fly with Malaysia Air, however not after this trip. I was flying by myself with my infant daughter, and it took 3 phone calls and 2 hours of my time to try establish that I was not able to purchase extra leg room because of travelling with my child. I purchase lounge access whilst in Kuala Lumper as they advertise having a family & child friendly space - having a room with no doors or toys is not a family friendly space. What tipped it all over the edge was that my new Samsonite suitcase has been broken - the external grip has been snapped off and rendered my suitcase unusable - however Malaysia Air claim that this is not their responsibility. Absolutely appalling customer service."

This has to be one of the worst airlines I’ve flown with. Seating arrangements are cramped, very poor inflight service, the food was soggy inedible mash, the steward refused to supply water to me. To top it off there’s been wilful failure to allocate my frequent flyer points without repeated follow ups. In fact on the last point I’m still waiting. I’ve made 3 phone calls, and I’ve written 3 emails. None of the emails have been answered. Staff assure me the flights were eligible for points and that it’s a computer generated error. Despite this, the error is still not fixed. If they apply the same duplicity to their technical operations I can see why they planes are so unsafe and keep on dropping out of the sky."

I’ve flown with Malaysia Airlines on many occasions for the past 35 years. I was loyal to the airline as I was born in Malaysia. The level of service has deteriorated to the point where Malaysia Airlines should be called a glorified budget airline at a premium price. I’ve flown on 10 separate occasions with MH, both domestic and international in the past 13 months. The cabin crew were sullen, curt and unfriendly and treated the passengers like a necessary evil. Food was average to poor. The tray was dirty and the plane was dated. There’s nothing to crow about KL airport.  Whatever happened to Malaysian hospitality? Never again."

The cabin attendants on MH0195 were very abrupt and had very poor customer service.  The cabin attendants were not at all attentive to the needs of the passengers.  No salutations when we left the plane. This was really appalling as when we got onto our next leg from KL to Auckland the crew were extremely courteous and friendly. However on this leg the food was very bad. The breakfast was not at all good. This is not something that we expected from Malaysian airlines which is our frequent airline. This has made us rethink and think of other options.

We flew with Malaysia Airline just this week. The seating was very uncomfortable and hardly enough room to cross your legs while seated, and I am very short. The seating is far too small for international flights. How are you meant to sleep in these conditions? The shorter flight from KL to Phuket has more leg room! Food was below average. Don`t recommend the red wine either. I would not like to fly with them again unless upgraded perhaps only then would consider flying with them again. The in-flight entertainment headphones I had on full volume but still had difficulty hearing the movie also did my partner. The noise of the plane in flight was so loud."

Beautiful lounge with a great selection of food. A rather long queue to enter the gate, although parents of young children need not queue. I was happy to go on the A330 instead of the 737. However, the A330 is rather old. Seat configuration is odd - seats are staggered but not really spacious. Flat bed is a plus. Good range of movies. Even though this is a night flight, no overnight pack or sleeping masks were provided. Good menu although I only got to try the satay as I slept through the flight."

Bigger plane were deployed this time, which made the journey much more enjoyable. Service and food were stellar! MH is trying their best to stay on top of the games, despite limited resources and profit loss. From HK to KL I had managed to secure the ""Throne"" seat 4K, lots of storage space and comfortable seating. From KL to Perth, they used an old A300-200 plate leased from SABENA (Already closed down), business class is like Thai airways staggered business flat bed, but very narrow and lack of storage space, all made for an average flight, but the great service and food made up for the inadequacy. Luggage transferred from HK to Perth were delivered promptly. Overall, it was a very good trip."

Payment is now applicable to select even a regular seat. Now my young female child (11) and I have been placed in two separate rows in two middle seats - this is absolutely ridiculous. I saw this only at the web check in 48 hours before. Now I cant even change seats by paying, since the aircraft is shown as full!. I understand they have to charge for seat selection, but common sense should be applied."

I flew with them this time due to convenient timings after a gap of 3-4 years after being fed up with very inconsistent service in between but this flight was a very pleasant surprise and if this is the service level then kudos for a great job done. Very good, clean and comfortable aircraft on both legs of the journey with well kept bathrooms. I paid extra for extra legroom seats and it was completely worth it. The cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful throughout the flight. The flights were exactly on time both while departing and arriving. Just a few grouses, Malaysia Airlines seems to have done away with alcohol in Economy Class, not that I miss it, but worth noting though they had quite a few soft drinks and juices available. The food from Mumbai to Kuala Lumpur was average, nothing to complain about but the breakfast in the Kuala Lumpur to Denpasar leg was really good. The only real issue was that the inflight entertainment system is rather tough to operate. But these are minor grouses, overall a big thumbs up."

Plane looks old and I could feel the person behind me constantly hitting my chair. 737s are never comfortable - even business class seats are not comfortable. A selection of juices and water was offered as pre-flight drinks but I requested champagne, which they were happy to oblige. At meal time, all courses were served at once - like in economy class, except served on cutlery. The food is delicious though - hokkien noodles live up to the Malaysian standards. Entertainment is good and we get noise cancelling headsets. Service was excellent - my champagne was topped up throughout the flight."

Worst airline ever and first time being bumped off a flight because it was overbooked.  It's not fair to leave paying customers stranded with their miserable pittance compensation. The airport is located in the middle of nowhere and far away from KL CBD. How do you justify in compensating stress and inconvenience? They have lost me as a customer.
Not Verified ,A330,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok,April 2019,3.0,4.0,,,,1.0,4,no,2,"  Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok. This airline has a policy where after purchasing an economy class seat, you can bid on an upgrade. I did  that and won the bid. Malaysia Airlines charged my CC immediately. However, when checking in at KL Airport, they had downgraded me with no firm reason. The assistant at the transit desk said it was because of the change of plane and in turn had less business class seats. This was incorrect. A dispute was raised, at which time they said the money will be refunded in 4 - 8 weeks. They mentioned they were refunding the money to a credit card that wasn't mine. Offering something, taking money for it, cancelling it, and then keeping the money for up to 8 weeks is somewhat unethical. Spending my valuable time in order to get my money back on an issue that is clearly their fault. Historically I have flown Malaysia Air in First, Biz Class and Economy a few years ago and I believe they were a 5 star airline at one time. They were at one time excellent. It's a shame to see how far they have fallen."

Ground services in Perth are good, clear announcements all around. The plane was delayed and an email came through informing us of the change in departure time. I selected the extra legroom seats in front of the economy cabin which were very comfortable. Plenty of legroom and the seats were wide enough for me, and I am big. The flight eventually took off at 0250 and again, dinner service came about 30 minutes later. What is it with Malaysia Airlines and their inappropriate timing with meals? Why not just do a beverage service and serve a decent breakfast before landing? As a result, we got tiny portions of rice and curry at 3 am and nothing else afterwards. The crew were pleasant and responsive and I couldn't fault them. IFE was okay but the touch screens are not very responsive and there is no hand held device to use instead of the touch screen. Landed on time despite the delay and baggage was delivered fast. No complaints here."

On board the flight, I found it appalling that the staff offered me, a female travelling alone, only fruit juice as a pre-flight drink but offered males and couples alcoholic beverages. Not long after take-off, I requested a toiletry pack from the cabin-crew, as none was provided at my seat (other seats in Business Class appeared to have one) and after the staff member searched my seat area, I was told she would get me one shortly. As this was an overnight flight, I did not push my request, but asked again in the morning and was told that it was not needed as we were about to land. When I went to use the bathroom in the morning, I tried to excuse myself to get past the staff standing in the galley (complaining about another passenger who had been extremely rude to the staff) and I was spoken to very rudely and told that I should use the bathrooms in the economy area. The business class toilet was vacant and no-one and I waited 10 minutes and no-one went into the bathroom, but when I went to the galley again the staff again blocked the access and I was forced to use the economy toilet. I feel the staff’s treatment of me on this flight was judgmental and extremely rude, and displayed a level of arrogance. I work in a service industry and am always mindful of treating others as I would like to be treated – with politeness and courtesy. I passed my complaint to Malaysia Airlines but their 'customer care officer' is continuing to refuse to escalate my complaint for resolution. Appalling behaviour by in-flight crew supported by the unprofessional attitude of their, loosely termed Customer Care."

The flight was booked about 5 months in advance. On the airport i was told that there was a technical problem and therefore if I wanted to stay a night extra. That was ok for me but not when they told me it was without compensation. They told me to wait. A bit later whey wanted to put me on another flight Malindo, again without compensation. I booked MAS for some extra comfort but they wanted my money but put me on an other aircraft. I refused since no compensation was offered. So I got my original flight, which I later regretted. The food was some of the worst I had on board. And there was no entertainment on a nearly 5 hours flight. If you want to fly budget and paying a lot MAS is the company for you, if you want service even Air Asia or Lion Air would provide you more. Don’t be fooled like me as I thought it was a better choice."

Ground staff were very helpful at Heathrow airport especially the manageress, she is very friendly and she kept asking her staff to help me to negotiate with the MAS head office in Kuala Lumpur to reduce my penalty charge due to unexpected issue at home. Eventually still have to pay £505 penalty charge. Feeling angry and disgusting for this so called penalty charge due to emergency case at home and not due to lateness to miss the flight and etc. "

They only allow for max. 2 hours check-in in Phnom Penh which is insufficient, at times chaotic, and deprives amble time for the lounge. Check-in online is waste of time as PNH airport does not accept online Boarding Passes anyway. The 3rd party lounge MH uses in PNH, Premium Plaza, is nice but food and drink offered has deteriorated compared to 2 years ago when they opened: the Bakery is dead, narrow drinks offering, noodle bar with industrialised ingredients only (e.g. fish-balls and meatballs, no unprocessed meat). Onboard, nice classic business-class seats with personalized IFE. Flights on time and luggage handled perfectly to Saigon: luggage allowance is generous, 40 kg, and was quickly delivered at destination. Have neither had serious delays nor luggage losses with an estimated now over 50 flights I have taken with Malaysian. Generous miles also rendered. I am happy to take this big detour; MH always delivers, and their lounges in KUL are top class. It’s a dry airline and even beers are banned."

Her hand luggage weighed 9 kg Which was approved by the  check in person and a tag was given too saying its fine to carry that weight. While boarding the first flight at the gate she was stopped since she had a bag pack and a camera with her. she had to throw away the bag pack  and was allowed to travel from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur. Again while boarding her 2nd flight from Kuala Lampur to Dhaka she was stopped at the gate and was said to have overweight though there was a tag of 9 kg on the hand luggage and also it was less than 9 kg now since she threw her clothes, she was not allowed to get on the plane until they forced her to pay extra.

Though laughing, eating, drinking and joking happily amongst themselves in the galley. Couldnt squeeze a smile out of them. Offered acidic carton orange or apple juice or water on boarding. Then nothing for 1 hour 15 minutes when the drinks trolley entered the cabin. So slow for night flight. Then lukewarm satay and anything off the ""anytime"" snack menu. All ordinary. I had ordered from the ""Chef on Call"" menu which listed 8 supper items. It never showed. Woken an incredible 3 hours before landing. Breakfast served and asked for my choice. Then told i couldnt have it because i ordered Chef on Call. So was brought supper grilled fish fillets with mashed potato and baby carrots for breakfast. Explained this was a supper meal. Cabin crew more or less stated take it or leave it. I left it. No big deal. I would get a muffin at McD on landing. Very sweet and commited Indian flight attendant then brought a nice coffee from the rear galley. No such friendliness from the senior forward galley crew. Cold robotic crew.

The food was bad but we think maybe because of our taste is different. So i decided to buy some food on the way back. First some how they put my 6 years old kid seat alone far away from us so it leading to no meal for her! The flight attendant said ""child meal is nothing, she will give us other meal!"" Next 15 mins she came back and said because of the wrong seating (we did not know that she have to seat in other seat so we seated together.) So they fixed it. But yes the child meal is horrible, chocolate, sweet drink, and kind of chicken with mashed potatoes. My kid did not eat any of that just a drink. We kindly asked for a coffee, fight attendant said the airplane is go though a turbulence so they cant service the hot drink! Ok fine we understand. About 45 mins before landing. We asking again (Tthe turbulence is finished) the flight attendant said! "" what for? We almost landing"" then walk off! We won't travel with Malaysia Airlines again!"

There was a queue for the baggage drop but the line cleared quickly as there were many counters open at that time. Proceed to the departure hall where I spent my waiting time at the domestic Golden Lounge. The lounge had food and drink options - no alcoholic drinks provided. No shower room available as well compared to their regional lounge. Food choices were fair and palatable, no complains. Variety could be better. Some children in the lounge were pretty noisy and that made it quite uncomfortable but the lounge had an area with a great view of the tarmac for plane-spotting. Boarding was quick and efficient too at the departure gate. The aircraft used was 9M-MXJ, a Boeing 737-8H6 used for MH domestic and regional short haul flights. Seats were leather, fairly comfortable although seat pitch could be better (I'm 1.85m tall so can be quite cramp). 2 food options for inflight meal service, food was served piping hot so it was great.

The ticket was a coup, purchased under heavy promotion from Malaysia Airlines homepage, class D, and could be changed endlessly as desired. Generous miles given. Smooth transfer in SGN to where I arrived from KUL (also on MH) in economy. They re-labelled the luggage so I avoided exiting transit. MH has in SGN changed to use the new Le Saigonnais Lounge which is a blessing and an improvement to the previous Apricot. In KUL, I had a night over in Golden Lounge (accessed to elite FFP-card by QR), which went smoothly. Malaysia Airlines delivers and make me willing to take long detours when the price is tempting. Largest weakness is lack of any booze on regional and domestic flights. This is accentuated by the ageing fleet of noisy B737 equipped with unpredictable configuration and refurbishment.

The uniform and the MAS logo brings good memories when MAS was actually good and was one of the best airlines in the world. However, it is disheartening to see that our national airline's standard has deteriorated over the years. From old and worn-out planes, dysfunctional inflight entertainment, bad quality food, and the worst of all, unfriendly and unhelpful staff. On my recent flight there was a stewardess who was in such a bad temper, she was almost throwing the in flight meals at us. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. I'm not a demanding person and I've flown with many airlines to be able to see the difference. Work is busy and I wouldn't have written in if it were just a one time disappointment or isolated incident. While others strive to provide unfailingly good service, MAS has excelled in providing consistently poor service. If you have a choice, and you treasure a pleasant flight experience, choose another airline."

I had purchased a last minute upgrade to business at the check in counter where I was informed that infants cannot be upgraded, but it is just an issue within the system and there would be no issue with my baby seating with me, it is just for the processing for the ticket. Upon embarking the plane, the flight attendant told me he couldn’t seat with me. The initial counter staff then got on the plane and dismissed their initial statements saying they could sit with me. They also told me it was just during the take off he couldn’t sit with me but the flight attendants refused? Which ended up with me sitting in economy. The counter staff and flight attendants also fed me misinformation such as the captain could make a decision on where we could seat but this was not true. They are refusing to refund the money we paid for the upgrade. "

Overall the flight was quite pleasant. Food was adequate, and there was a normal amount of leg room. Unfortunately on our return flight we ran into some problems where our trains to the airport were hours late. Subsequently we missed our flight and were left out to dry by the Malaysia Airlines staff. A one and a half hour delay caused us to be 10 minutes late to check in (1 hour before departure). The staff did not help us find another flight and after searching online we found that we essentially had to pay a fee equivalent to the price of our entire return trip from Australia for missing our flight if we wanted to rebook. On top of this we would have to pay the difference between our original flight and the rebooked flight which looked like double four times the original price. Overall probably would have been fine with the experience if we didn't have to go through the difficult situation of rescheduling flights. Customer service was almost no help and they were not transparent about how they calculated these extra fees and last minute prices. Malaysia Airlines were one of the cheapest options but honestly after this they may not be worth it. Flights are often very time specific and taken in potentially stressful situations so in the future I would recommend just paying the little bit extra to use a more reliable airline with a better reputation."

This is my first time flying A350 so I am really excited to experience the new aircraft and Malaysia Airlines business class. At Sydney T1 there are priority lanes for Business Suites and Business passengers, as well as Enrich Platinum, Gold and Silver members. Business class passengers receive 40kg of check-in luggage, but also an express boarding voucher to skip the queue through immigration at Sydney Airport. This definitely comes in handy, especially at Sydney Airport. At the gate, there is no announcement made and the signs for priority passengers are not made clear too. However, once onboard the plane, the cabin crew truly shines, and they live and breath the Malaysian Hospitality. The crew are really friendly and warm. They started with champagne and non-alcoholic beverages before take off. They even offer a top up for my champagne too, which is a bonus. Shortly after take-off, the crew starts serving more drinks and some light snacks. Then, they serve the signature satay. I chose both the chicken and beef satays and the satays truly live up to their name and reputation! For lunch, I chose the Tasmanian salmon for entree, pre-ordered curry chicken with rice through chef-on-board, and seasonal fruit as dessert. Lunch is beautiful and full of flavour. Midway through the flight, I ordered a plate of vegetarian mee goreng or fried noodles which is quite delicious. Before landing, the crew goes around with another round of food. This time I choose the ham and egg sandwich. By this time, I feel like I am truly well fed by the crew. The cabin crew have also shown exceptional services through the little things that they do. For example, when they see my empty water bottle, they offer to refill it for me. The crew is super friendly, chatty and one of them has even given me a private tour of the aircraft, including helping me to solve a lifelong mystery - where do cabin crew get their rest during an ultra long haul flight! If I could rate this experience a 11 out of 10, this flight is definitely the one!"

Arrived to airport on time and took my flight as planned from Penang to Kuala Lumpur. During the connection to my flight to Hong Kong, I had to clear immigration which was ridiculously long for foreigners (finger print, stamps, the works) and get from one end of the airport to the other. Malaysia Airlines did not allocate enough time for a passenger to reasonably make it through these steps to the connecting flight. Upon finally clearing immigration, we ran to the gate where they informed us they had just closed the boarding doors and that we would need to pay a USD $200 to get on the next flight. Explained the situation to the duty manager who also refused to accommodate us on the next available flight. When we did everything right, and Malaysia Airlines left us behind and demanded we pay for it. Luckily, Cathay Pacific had several flights available and we had a wonderful experience flying with them, instead, to Hong Kong. Overall, ridiculously poor service from Malaysia Airlines and their food was bad, seats too cramped, wifi didn't work, and staff were rude.

This will be the first and only time we fly with this airline. The planes are modern and well equipped but the food in economy is so poor and shoddy. Couple that with a poor level of current films on in flight entertainment on an LHR to KL flight of some 13 hours. The KL to Auckland leg of 10.5 hours really provided so little room in economy as to make sleeping almost impossible. Same lack of choice of entertainment as well. I would choose Singapore Airlines instead. Having said that some might argue that you pay for what you get and the price tag from London to NZ at 1k each was reasonable. £200 more we could have gone with a caring airline.

It was a pleasant flight. We had no trouble while check in at Changi. However, the service was efficient and polite. The 738 to KUL is a bit outdated. The crew were polite and the service was again efficient. Transit process in KUL airport is easy and we no need to clear the customs, re-check our baggage etc as it was tagged straight to Heathrow. The A350 is a wonderful plane. We were sitting in an Extra Legroom Seat which is slightly more expensive than the economy as it got more legroom. The crew was super attentive and friendly. They looked after us through the flight and constantly walked around the cabin offering drinks like orange juice, apple juice, etc. They even gave me extra food when i went to the galley to have a chat with them. The Extra Legroom Seat is worth it. With just around $100(SGD) more, you got a seat with generous legroom, footrests and the crew will start servicing you first rather than the Economy passenger. The seat is pretty comfortable for a 14h flight despite the fact that it is exactly the same seat as the economy class seat with only additional legroom and footrest. The meal from KL - based catering is good but nothing special. However the inflight entertainment could be better. I would suggest you to bring your own entertainment device as for me, the selection is not as good as airline like SIA, Emirates etc. I would recommend Malaysia Airlines for you whom intending to travel to London from KL or KL from London. It is value for money and with just around $100, you can get a pretty comfortable seat."

I witnessed how she treated passengers from seat row 9 and below during distribution of inflight meals. No ""excuse me"", no ""thank you"", no ""please"".

For the laptop bag stored under the seat compartment, the crew insisted that the bag did not fit inside and asked to put at the overhead compartment. As I am a frequent flyer, I do not understand the intention behind the staff of insisting to put my laptop bag in the overhead compartment. Secondly, they only served 1 type of meal, which was beef rice on board. This was the worst part of not having 2 different types of meals as some people don't eat beef. Overall, the flight from Seoul to KL was definitely unpleasant and I felt like I should be serving the ""crew"" instead."

Forget about a smile, you will be lucky if you are not shouted down upon.  I felt bad for the guy who got shouted upon, he failed to comply with the baggage policy and carry and extra laptop bag.

We had to literally run to the other terminal and when we arrived it was delayed for 1.5. We arrived in Mumbai very late around 1am. The return flight from Mumbai to KL was delayed again and I asked the ground staff in Mumbai if the flight will be on schedule arriving in KL due to short connecting time, she said yes dont worry sir, it will be the same time. Arrived in KL, we only had 40 minutes from take off time, we run all the way and made it. Arrived in Jakarta our luggage were left behind in KL. Around 23.30, we made a claim to baggage handler in Jakarta and they were other people around 6 passengers had the same cases. The ground crew said this is much better compare to earlier time in 2018, he said almost half of the luggage were left in KL.

The ground staff at Kuala Lumpur helped us in rebooking our return flights. There were so much problems in rebooking as there were no seats available from the kulalumpur to Bamgalore segment. She had to contact her supervisor and spent quite a bit of time to get that booking done, all along with a pleasant attitude. Heartfelt thanks to these staff.

The airline website states that the Business Class product on the 738 features in seat, inflight entertainment system, power points and recliner seats that offer extendable leg rests. When I booked this flight months before my traveling date, I checked the seat map and it displayed as the configuration that offered the Business Class as advertised on the website. However, upon check in, I discovered that the aircraft that'll be flying today is the older one with no IFE, no power points and inferior seating. So I went to the check in desk and asked whether my booking can be transferred to the next flight (which offered the new products). The personnel at the check in said it was not possible and said that I would need to pay a penalty should I wish to have my flight change. I explained that I specifically chose a flight that offered the new products, only to be told off ""How do you know if the aircraft is new or old?"" Immediately, I said that I've checked the seat map during the booking and the map states that the aircraft should be the new one. He kept quiet when I told him off and he realised that I knew how to identify whether the 738 offered superior or inferior products. Not wanting to create a scene, I took my boarding pass and walked off. So for those of you booking on this airline, if you are looking for the aircraft that offers the IFE etc, check the Economy Class seat map. If the last row is 30, you'll be flying with the old product. If the last seat row is 29, that's the new one. The airline's website is vague when it comes to revealing what it actually offers on board. Have stopped supporting them for quite some time and thought I'd give them a try.

Even though it was written Confirmed for the bassinet in my ticket, my travel agent told me to go to airport early so I could request one. They allocate bassinet on first come first serve and I couldn't book one for myself online. My ticket said confirmed, where I had a small amount of hope left on one corner. So I went early to the airport and told by the staff behind the counter that the bassinet was already been booked online by another passenger. So I'd to fly without a bassinet from Kathmandu to Malaysia, holding our baby in our arms back and forth. They gave us 3 seats in a row and asked us to request with airlines in Malaysia for the flight from Malaysia to Sydney. Again in Malaysia, I went to request with the airlines staff for a bassinet, where I was told that all the bassinets were gone. I even requested if there were any 3 seats in a row were available as optional.But I was told that we were flying in a full of house flight, where not a single seat was empty in that flight. When I boarded into the plane what I saw was,the both sides of the bassinet seats were given to the individual passengers. I was told that they had paid extra for leg space online. I do understand that people pay extra for the add ons comfort,but isn't that a priority for a parents to have that opportunity of the designated seats(with bassinets)?? Just because the airlines wanted to make extra money providing those designated seats to other passengers. This left us with just frustration and terrible experience flying with Malaysian airlines. We were told by our travel agent that we couldn't even check online just because we needed a bassinet. In addition to this, we spotted plenty of empty seats at the back. Many passengers were sleeping in a row of 4 seats, where I was told it was a full of house flight. They gave us many misleading informations to have enough trouble in our travel. I won't be travelling in Malaysia Airlines any more and telling my friends and family the same."

I landed in Hyderabad on 12th Nov 2018 from Melbourne only to know that they didn't load my luggage from KUL. Despite the issue, I kept my calm and tried to work with MH to locate my luggage. It has been 8 days today and I have been left without communication from MH. I have sent several emails and all I get is auto email from them but no one from MH has ever bothered calling and find out what difficulties I'm going through. When I asked for compensation from baggage handlers, they said max I will get is $20 per Kg which equates to $440 USD.

Great trip made very enjoyable by excellent flight attendants in economy section. Having had numerous mixed experience economy and business flights with MAS in recent years, these guys stood out with a genuine friendliness and attentiveness to all the demands and nonsense we passengers provide. With only two FA's to provide full meal service to a full economy section, and a medical crisis mid flight, their cheerful service right to the end was impressive. Flight was on time. My one criticism is, if MAS chooses not to carry immigration forms on flights, then hand them out at the the boarding check. Leaving them on a counter nearby is not good enough. Again, our economy flight attendants sorted this problem out for us."

Cancelling my connecting flight and informing me via email 2 hours before my 5.55am first leg flight is not okay despite your airport staff’s adamance. Also not acceptable is airport staff informing a passenger that the airline had notified the cancellation an appropriate amount of time for me to revise my arrangements. Appreciate you’ve moved me on the next available flight 3 hours later but offering coupons for breakfast (which had already been served on leg 1 flight) and lunch (to be served on leg 2 flight anyway) is not acceptable for waiting an additional 3 hours. At least with low cost airlines, no frills services are to be expected. Malaysia Airlines will remain outside of my options and recommendations for the foreseeable future."

IFE worked fine on this newish aircraft. Used my own headphones to enjoy better on a movie I saw. Ticket bought on-line as promotional cheap ticket – less than 200 USD (return) inc. 50 kg of luggage and 2 handluggage (I am Emerald, that adds a bit). PNH-airport: the online check-in boarding passes are not valid by airport authorities so I had to line up check-in physically – what a nuisance! Chose a good seat and rebooked a seat to have a row for myself near the toilets. Checked in online 48 hours before departure. Airport check-in was slow and opened only 2 hours prior departure at 3 counters – not enough time! Passengers are fearing missing their flights and queue up an hour before counters open! Check-in staff very provincial, don’t know major cities in Africa and Europe and fear complex travels. If not put under pressure the check-in staff don’t want to issue BPs and check-in luggage further than next destination. Even if interline agreement exists. Not good enough. Plaza Premium Lounge in PNH is slowly but steadily falling apart in terms of food and drinks. It used to be very good when it opened 2 years ago but now remains only the nice design, good space and views. The rest is going down in the drain day by day: shrinking food options of poor quality, the big “bakery” is now closed. No champagne, only extremely modest wine offering. Only one local draft beer remains. Disastrous and poor management combined with extreme cost savings on consumerables. Onboard: The free seats and food selection made online worked. While hot meals served onboard and special meal (seafood) was delivered smoothly. Inquiries for an additional dish of hot food was met – was lucky to have another fish dish. Golden Lounge in KLIA top notch. Elite status respected but I have never been upgraded – only for their own Enrich Miles elite they give courtesy upgrades. Rate as 10 of 10 but must deduct 1 for no alcohol available. I was almost intoxicated by all those soft drinks. Deduct another point for being cheated to check-in online which is useless theft of passengers time as it has no effect at all when coming to airport. Food could be better but for the accommodation of special meal and very low fare paid I can't complain on that one. Flights on time or earlier. No Luggage issues. All elite flyer priviliges met. A true 4 star airline, closer to 5 star than to 3 star!"

Got this ticket with the very good deal. I normally spend around USD 500 cheapest from Jakarta to Sydney, but this one is only USD 420! The crews were nice, the new aircraft A350 was nice although the seats were a bit hard. Meal were decent. Others were not bad. No amenities given, no menu, no amenities in the toilet like lowcost carrier. Menu from KUL to SYD were so and so but menu from SYD to KUL were nice! I hope MH be a rising star again!"

Tired of budget airlines being late on this route, I paid a bit more and assumed Malaysia Airlines had a better record. Turned up at the gate 90 minutes before departure to find the aircraft already at the gate.  Boarding was completed and one door closed 10 minutes beforehand. Then a 20 minute wait before the captain announced engineers had been working on a technical issue and take-off will be delayed by another 30 minutes. 30 minutes later, we were told the fault would take another 4 hours to fix. So we should disembark and wait for a new aircraft to be located. I suppose to have a new aircraft ready to take-off 2 hours later should be applauded but it still got us into BKK later even than most budget carriers I have taken. Neither the captain nor chief purser apologised for the very late take-off and arrival. FAs seemed more fed up than the passengers. At least the meal was tasty and the IFE passed the time."

As a lady traveler who's traveled quite a bit, it's so relieving to meet kind and compassionate people,especially when things aren't going right. That day, I felt sick and even got sick in-flight. One of the cabin crew (I know it's their job to assist) displayed kindness and compassion by inquiring if he could assist me and later got my cabin baggage down for me (I was feeling dizzy). He didn't have to. I had two friends with me. Thank you for stepping up."

Flights completely on time and basically faultless. I must deduct 3 stars of 10, however: 1 star for poor drink service (not even beer!) 1 star due to old equipment and sockets, tiny screens for IFE 1 star for fooling passengers to check in on-line to waste time at home and in airport. Good space in economy class – especially in the row 5, 17, and 19. Toilets were clean. Special meals ordered were delivered wqith precision though quality on economy was so-so (hardly edible!). FAs onboard were on top of things and tolerant to those of us who bought and brought a few beers on board purchased from airport. Check-in accepted me for arriving late and were quick to issue “real BP’s”: Don’t waste time on online check-in as the BPs are useless and neither accepted by airline nor immigration! And, to get real BP’s one must still present passport originals etc. What a disaster. What a joke and fraud to passengers time! Elite travellers respected. Cheap, but no miles given in Q-class. Lounges faultless (Apricot 3rd party in SGN and Golden First in KUL) and well equipped. Sdleeping facilities. Paid only 191 USD for 4 legs. A good, 4 star airline - for low price when purchased during campaigns. Will fly again."

They do not have a call center in different countries and you are routed to their call center back to Malaysia (which is an outsourced service to Fiji). Not just the no one ever picks up after making you wait as it drains your international call charges or no replies ever for emails, even if you are fortunate to receive an email, it is a template to refer to the relevant department and no one will come back to you. Should you need any ground assistance, there are no offices in international airports outside Malaysia to help. The onboard service was ok, the attendants were keen and courteous. Other than that plane was not in the best condition. The worst part is getting help after they retimed is impossible. Cheap as they are, they are cheap for a reason."

No reason, nor alternatives or phone numbers to call were offered. I called MH and was told that I would have to pay a hefty penalty if I insist to be placed on another flight since the change requested would be seen as voluntary. After an hour of pleading and bargaining, the agents supervisor finally gave in and put me on an MH night flight 3h later. One full night at a 5 star hotel in KL wasted! The flight was operated by an A380, which I usually adore, but this one was so rundown and outdated, that I didn’t enjoy the flight. The seats were uncomfortable, the staff robotic and not very friendly. The food was rather mediocre, USB port and power plug not functioning. Overall a below average flight."

I was lucky enough to get MH's brand new A350-900 going and coming back and what a wonderful aircraft it is. Silent and both the inflight entertainment system and wifi is second to none. Even though the IFE doesn't have as many options as airlines such as EK or SQ, it was more than adequate for my 8hr journey to KL. The onboard service was great and food was also good. Anytime I was given a drink, be it alcohol or soft drink, I was always given a full size can, which is more than I can say for some other full service airlines I've flown on. KLIA itself is a great transit airport, many food options and well priced. The KL to Bangkok sector was flown on a B737-800 which is also equipped with seat back tv screens, even though it's a less than 2hr flight. Both the flight going to and coming back from Bangkok were really comfortable and again, there was a full meal service. But most of all, the price I got was beyond belief, cheaper than some low cost airlines, even though the service was better than other full service airlines I've paid double the price for."

My last trip was great, this trip was fantastic. The crew, the food, the drink. Real Malaysian hospitality! My flight experience was a step up from last flights in 2017. I could sense a real desire from the crew to deliver an outstanding customer focused service- nothing was too much trouble. I was met at the aircraft door and shown to my seat, addressed by name throughout. All food served was of a high standard and very well presented. The seat comfort both seated and whist sleeping was very good. A quality business class product at a very reasonable cost. My Asian carrier of choice!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London  to Perth via Kuala Lumpur,August 2018,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  London to Perth via Kuala Lumpur. We booked a flight to United Kingdom to attend a wedding of a very close family sibling on 21st July 2018 and returning back to Perth, Australia on 12th August. Before leaving my home in the UK, we checked in online via the website, and the departure time was showing as scheduled which was 10.25am from London Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur, and these details were confirmed by the automated check in email, and also on the boarding pass. When we got to Heathrow Airport at 7am on 12th August, and went to drop off luggage, staff advised us that the flight departure time had been delayed until 16:30 for MH3, and we were issued with 4 breakfast vouchers. Why did Malaysia Airlines not email us to advise of the delay in the departure flight then I would not have bothered coming to the airport at 7am! Approximately at 15:30, we were waiting at the departure gate and staff announced that the flight would be further delayed till 17:30. Approximately 17:15 we started boarding but we did not depart till 18:45 which meant that we were sat in the aircraft for 1.5 hours.  At this stage, we had been at the airport for over 11 hours in total and I asked for hotel accommodation but Malaysia Airlines staff refused my request. We have never experienced so much incompetency from an established airline such as Malaysia Airlines, and I don’t think we would ever consider flying with Malaysia Airlines ever again."

The complaints about the journey, overall, are fairly minor, however an accumulation of these minor issues alongside the abysmal customer complaints service has warranted this review. Firstly, our flight was delayed. This happens and there is no point in complaining, however, there was no communication between the airline and passengers. In the end, we went to ask someone what was going on and they told us ‘Oh its only a minor delay, 20-40 minutes’. 2 hours later we boarded without any further communication following the initial and somewhat obscenely inaccurate estimation. This was, again, minor, but we had a interconnecting flight with a 2 hour 20 minute gap (which had now been reduced by 2 hours to just 20 minutes) and we had no idea what was going to happen. Would it have been too much trouble to make an announcement? My magazine pouch had a massive hole in it. My stuff went everywhere and I had to get on my hands and knees to retrieve it all.  My boyfriend’s on board entertainment system did not work. When he asked a member of staff if there was anything they could do to help, (not expecting much but it was worth asking) he was laughed at. They eventually confirmed his seat number and ran a reboot, but it did not work. None of the charging ports were working. It was just so frustrating for him having to sit and do nothing for the duration of the flight. In truth, we rotated seats and shared the burden. I was feeling extremely rough at one point during the 14h flight so I went to the back of the plane to be near the facilities. There was a row of 3 reserved seats for staff rest. Whilst it was completely unoccupied, and had been for well over 2 hours, my boyfriend asked a member of staff if I could rest there for a short while just so I could be next to the toilet. Very kindly, I was allowed. But we were abruptly asked to leave the area immediately and return to our seats by another member of staff.  She didn’t even sit down in the seat I was in, she just didn’t want me there. It may sound petty, but its all building up. Thank goodness we made our connecting flight."

On my return flight (London - KL - Kuantan), my connecting flight from KL to Kuantan was delayed by almost 4 hours (only when asked did they give a breakfast voucher with no written value, while checking at the restaurant, was informed the value was only RM13, balance needed to topped up by myself).

I think they were tired and not very happy, then again, who would be if you have to serve a plane load of passengers. Overall, on economy class, it's what I expected. Food was ok - edible.

✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Sydney to Kuala Lumpur,August 2018,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,1.0,4,no,3,  Sydney to Kuala Lumpur. I am a disabled passenger flying regularly on business class on Malaysia Airlines. I was humiliated in Sydney recently when I was trying to check in by a rude lady at the counter who loudly inquired what my condition was for her to give me the required wheel chair assistance and wanted supporting documents from me. I have Cerebral palsy and you don't need a doctor to understand that I need assistance. Be that as it may all my documents were uploaded to the system. Even if that was not the case she had no business asking me what my condition was in front of all the others in the line. I wrote to the customer care people at the airline and they initially agreed that this has happened but that it was done to help me. Later the story changed and they deny anything happened. I understand that there will always be the rude and arrogant employee who will treat customers badly. However the airline denying that such an incident happened is unacceptable.
✅ Trip Verified ,A380-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Kuala Lumpur,August 2018,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4,yes,9," We had a seat on the upper deck of the A380 flying from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur. We were really surprised by the incredible legroom offered on the upper deck, as well as a storage space beside the window on the economy class! The whole flight was very comfortable and relaxing to the extent that I was a bit reluctant to leave the plane. Some of the crews were very warm and welcoming but some were just average (not rude but not particularly warm and friendly as well). To comment objectively, the food served was better than average, but not what I had expected. However, the pizza served one hour before landing and it was surprisingly delicious. They offered us a drink very frequently, about 5 times throughout the whole flight and of course, you need not wait for them to offer you as you can always ask for one. The IFE was decent, with some new movies like Infinity War etc. However, the IFE feels a bit dated (compared to the newer ones on their A350) and there are no games to play as well. Overall, it was a very positive experience with Malaysia Airlines and I will fly with them again in the future."

Very disappointing to find business class is now nowhere near as good as it used to be. The business class cabin was two thirds empty. No champagne is offered on boarding with a flight attendant saying ""this is not allowed until we're in the air"". This is out of step with most other airlines especially MH's One World partners. The service was just satisfactory with the crew doing the bare minimum. The one toilet in business class was not cleaned throughout the flight and was disgusting by the time we arrived in KL. The food was just awful. We ""booked the cook"" online, my beef ribs were a fatty, gristly mess which was inedible. The seating is OK provided you get the larger version with more space and storage, which the adjoining seat doesn't have making it feel cramped. Movies and TV shows are heavily censored to the point of being ridiculous. Staff in the lounge at KL are at best indifferent. The bar has been hidden away in a separate room near the entrance with no comfortable seating. We were left standing at the desk to get towels for the showers with no staff in sight. Eventually someone appeared and we had to hand over our boarding passes to get a threadbare towel. Your pass is returned when you return the towel. What a joke. We won't be flying with them again."

We explained that we had made this entry several times without having to have such a ticket and was there any alternative, such as a passenger waiver form, as our flight was leaving very soon. The representative became increasingly rude in his manner.  I was upset with this man's total lack of empathy or professionalism in a time of high stress. He found our situation amusing. Up until now I have been extremely happy with Malaysia Airlines services and professionalism. Maybe MH should look a little more closely at their employee supervision?"

Checked in on-line to access lounge in Bangkok early. Uses good lounges in Bangkok, I tried JAL, Cathay, and Miracle. Airline skirmished by strict non-alcohol policy for short flights, and at times, FA’s confiscate people who bring their own drinks/beer on board. Very bad policy that undermines the airline – it is hypocrisy / double moral as they serve alcohol on all longer flights. Very inconstant policy and attitude de facto depends on individual FA’s interpretation also (some are flexible, others are straight). Arrived KLIA late evening and got some sleep in the Golden lounge nap area. Excellent lounges offered in KLIA, dynamic, proactive, young staff. Onboard, IFE is fine. Headphones are of poor quality. Individual screens. Next day continuing to Saigon without any negative remarks: Full flight, good IFE, special meal delivered, arrived on time, airbridge gate boarding and disembarkation in all four instances. Details shows that MH is on the rise: signature bread offered, high quality plastic cutlery is given out on economy class (the best and strongest plastic cutlery that I have ever seen). Special meals accommodated and served to perfection. Cheap ticket which rendered extremely high value for money with an FFP elite status in hand. Got a 50 kg baggage allowance even in economy."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Sydney to London via Kuala Lumpur,August 2017,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Sydney to London via Kuala Lumpur. I bought a return business class with MAS last year for trip with my family to Sydney Australia. The problems started with our inability to utilise the on-demand dining service due to an error on their website which we were told was due to a system upgrade. As regular fliers we chalked this down to one of those things that every company goes through and didn't think more if it. On my return flight, I again went to check in online and use the service but again online check-in and dine on demand was unavailable. Again thought nothing of it until I arrived at Sydney airport. Not only did I arrive to a closed check-in counter with no ground staff available. I was told (eventually by Sydney airport staff) that the flight time had been changed and clearly I had not been notified despite MAS having my mobile and email address. Attempts to contact MAS customer service were useless and I eventually had to purchase a 1 way ticket on the day with QR in order to get back home on time. I raised a complaint via MAS customer centre only to be kept on hold for long periods of time and I was repeatedly told that I may not have been informed of the flight change time due to what became the infamous ""system upgrade"" and the excessive wait times were due to my record not being found due to the ""system upgrade"". I have made repeated attempts to contact MAS customer service and management team for over a year to no avail. The most I have received is a luke warm ""we are looking into it message"" from a customer service agent. Customer Service is poor to say the least.  For the money their premium tickets cost, there is far much better value for money from other airlines."

Awful experience, awful customer service. They emailed me after I had departed for the airport to say that my flight had been brought forward a few hours. How can they possible leave it so late and expect me to arrive in time? Not even a phone call. Actually, they didn't move the flight forward - they cancelled my original flight and decided to put me on an earlier one. I then had problems with seats, food and so on. My complaint took more than 6 weeks before I received a totally inadequate reply. Never using them again."

We were stuck inside at the Transfer Counter where it has taken about 2 hours or more to get our voucher for hotel stay that night. Worst part was that the shuttle to hotel that was about to start at 12 AM started around 1:15 AM. They waited for an hour at the airport for other passengers. The kids were very tired and when we reached the hotel, it was almost 2:20 AM. We hardly had any sleep. And had to get up by 5 AM to rush back by 6 AM shuttle to airport. It was better to stay back at the airport rather be awake all night, waiting in the shuttle for an hour and travelling back and forth to the hotel 1 hour each way.  We opted for vegetarian meal and the food was worst.  And for vegetarians, there are not many options at the airport though the airline gave vouchers. It was a bad experience."

I've flown business class on MH regionally and domestic six times in the past 2 years and been very happy (apart from the no alcohol policy), so decided to book this long haul business class flight. MH3 LHR-KUL had a creeping delay which ended up at 5 hours 50 mins late. New onboard business product on A350 is very cramped and a big disappointment. While in Sabah MH reservations removed my return booking from their system which caused me problems and humiliation at check in at Kota Kinalablu and again at KL transfer desk (30mins plus 45mins), as they couldn't get my booking back to be live on their system to issue boarding passes. When we did eventually get on the flights we didn't have the seats we'd selected. I submitted a complaint 20 June and still not had any response 1 month later. Shockingly poor service to a bus class pax and OneWorld Sapphire card holder. They seem to be ignoring their legal obligations to pay delay compensation for an EU originating flight."

Flew Ho Chi Minh City to Bangkok via Kuala Lumpur on their ageing B737’s on 21st July 2018. Check-in in SGN was a breeze as usual – I always get the feeling that they just are waiting for me at the counter. This time there were 6 Biz-pax in front of me, but they spotted me as I apparently travelled without inscribed luggage. Thus I was picked aside by the MH-manager who personally checked me in and changed my seats without even asking: he just by his own reassigned me other seats – at first I did not discover – but then later while in the lounge: I checked the aircraft’s configuration: he had given me other, better seats, much appreciated. It took him two Minutes at the counter to issue BPs throughout. I) was granted 50 kg luyggage that I did not use. They respect other Oneworld elite travellers and gave me the earned privileges to “their” SGN-lounge – they use Apricot, a 3rd-party lounge of good quality with excellent views of the tarmac. That lounge improves day by day, I really like the effort. Had some stuff printed out from the Lounge’s business-centre within Minutes. However, the amazing regional “Golden-lounge” in KLIA is even better, inc. sparkling wines and domesticated buffet with hot dishes. One senior staff helped me to make a complicated rebooking and spent over 1 hour for me and eventually we succeeded for a modest ticket change fee; well done. First flight on time – second flight delayed 45 Minutes waiting on the tarmac. On board the FAs are good – even in economy. Special meal pre-ordered and effectuated to perfection. Flights on time – have neither had serious delays nor luggage problem with this airline. Thus, at times when I read several of the reviews in this forum I cannot recognise that it’s the same airline. IFE fair/good on 2nd leg but lacking on 1st leg. Seats OK and spacious for economy. MH are opting their game. However, the lack of beer or wines served onboard on short and medium-haul flights are a big minus that put the airline at max. 4 stars out of 5."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Singapore,July 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,  Flight was supposed to be at 11:45am on 21/7/18. We were told at approximately 10:32am that the flight was “retimed” (fancy way of saying “delayed” I suppose) to 1:40pm. Just under 2 hours. It is now 2:49pm and I have been sitting in the aircraft for the last 1.5 hours and it hasn’t moved. No concession of any sort given to passengers. You say it’s an under two hour delay but in actual fact it is more than 3 hours. This is very frustrating and shame on you for allowing such delays like this. To make matters worse you don’t provide ear phones for us to watch movies. We can’t order drinks because it’s a short flight apparently. Overall a bad experience.

I took MH606 on 21 Jul and there was a flight delay of more than 2 hours. It was known on Malaysia airlines website that meals compensation should be provided if delay exceeds 2 hours. However, meal vouchers was not given automatically until I asked for it. The officer claim compensation only provided if delay more than 2 hours but finally gave me the meal vouchers. There were many people in the line who queued for 45min and receive nothing. MH should provide compensation automatically to passengers inconvenience without people asking for it. This is even so especially compensation note was published officially on the website."

Both flights almost full in both classes. First flight delayed 30 Minutes (well announced!), next flight on time. Check-in in Phnom Penh was tedious with an annoying junior 3rd part staff. He wanted to force me to inscribe 1 of 2 pieces of hand-luggage which I tried to refuse and eventually succeeded. There is only 1½ hour check-in time in Phnom Penh which is far too little for full flights like this. As the only Oneworld Airline in the Airport, the staff do not allow you to use your check-in online boarding cards – just waste of time as you have to go through all the check in formalities in Airport anyway. Lounge granted is Plaza Premium, a nicely designed and furbished lounge, but with residing food and drink offerings. Their Bakery is closed. The amazing “Golden-lounge” in KLIA main terminal is nice and spacious. On board FAs are professional and kind. Seat selection and special meals are all free when ticket is purchased on their website. I ordered seafood meal and it was fine on both legs. I tasted other offerings from the menu as well. IFE systems good with touch screens. The big classic business class chairs are extremely nice - better than new lie flat seats. No alcoholic drinks offered. 2 months ago they stopped stand-by options to take earlier flight – a clear service deterioration. Ticket shamelessly cheap but was also purchased 6 months earlier at a sale – when purchased so early the risk of pricey changes/cancellations increase a lot."

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Kuala Lumpur,July 2018,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,5.0,4,yes,7,"  Perth to Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia Airlines use a B737 which is not a comfortable jet for a 5.5 hour flight. The queue for the toilet gets long as in Y class they are located at the end of the aircraft. Boarding was handled very well by ground staff in PER. The aircraft was clean but dated. Seats were narrow and seat pitch on the B737 is a measly 30 inches. IFE was okay but the sound was scratchy over the headphones, despite trying a different pair. The food portions were tasty but really small. The flight from Perth leaves at 350pm and they serve you a full meal at that time. Why not wait for actual dinner time and serve the hot meal before landing? Alcohol was not offered readily and they don't get that you should have a drink WITH your meal and not after your meal. In one half of the aircraft, the FA was handing out meals with no drinks on her trolley. No hot drinks for most of the flight as there was turbulence half way through the flight but the seat belt sign was then left on for the remainder of the time. FA's were helpful and efficient but were not friendly in anyway. Overall, an average, unremarkable experience."

From the check-in and baggage, it was quite effortless as there are check-in machines where passengers can check-in independently and print baggage tag directly. But, passengers still required to queue to the counter to drop the baggage. The flight was quite on time, but in-flight experience was just fine. Since it is a short-haul flight, passengers were just given peanuts and orange juice for snacks."

Check-in in SGN was a breeze as usual – I always get the feeling that they just are waiting for me at the counter. It took them < 2 Minutes at the counter to process me. Ticket purchased under a campaign for the price resembling that of an economy class ticket. Lounge granted in Saigon is called Apricot, a 3rd-party lounge of good quality. I could have saved ½-1 day of time if I’d taken a direct flight SGN-PNH. However, I gladly take the detour from Saigon over Kuala Lumpur to enjoy the business class privileges, including the amazing “Golden-lounges” in KLIA. On time. 40 kg of checked-in luggage is included in business class (plus some 20 kg in addition from Oneworld Emerald privileges). Luggage handled correctly, expedite, and with care. On board the FAs are professional and kind. Seat selection and special meals are all free when purchased on their website. I ordered Seafood-meal and it was OK (not excellent) and delivered smoothly. The remaining food provision for the cabin was also good, menu-cards with 3 hot options were given to all 16 passengers on business class (that cabin was full, economy only half). I had a grilled red snapper as an additional dish. Staff were proactive and in a sparkling good mood. IFE systems good with touch screens on the individual Monitors. More important is these gorgeous, classic huge, well-bolstered business class chairs that furbish the biz-class cabin. They are so nice and in my view better than new lie flat seats. Onboard, they also provide most of the immigration forms to fill prior to landing in PNH, which saves time. No alcoholic drinks offered thus I bought a beer from Airport which they allowed (or ignored?) me to consume on board. Have never had any issues with Malaysia Airlines, including ticket changes, refunds, luggage, and their impressive punctuality. For the price that I paid it would have been a pure 10/10 score but I need to deduct a point for the limited drink offering. I even got a substantial amount of miles and Q-credits to my Qatar Airways frequent flyer programme."

The first thing that I saw when I want to check in my luggage was the extremely long queue at the check in counters. There were only 6 counters for Malaysia Airlines(only 5 counters for economy class), but 12 counters for Qatar Airways in the same row. Perhaps Malaysia Airlines can increase the number of check in counters in Seoul Airport to increase the efficiency of luggage check in process. I waited for more than an hour to check in my luggage. The seat was comfortable and the legroom is big enough for me to stretch my legs. The cabin staff was very friendly. The breakfast(American breakfast) provided is nice, but the portion is not enough for me. The in flight entertainment was awesome and had a lot of movies and musics."

Malaysian Airlines cancelled and rescheduled all four of my flights going to Dhaka via Kuala Lumpur and back due to technical problems. The worst part though was not the cancellation, but the way they dealt with it. I was provided no compensation for the four delayed flights, even though it cost me an additional one night of hotel booking as well as the loss of a night I had originally booked in a hotel. For the return cancellations, I received no notification until the day of departure, even though the cancellation was known 5 days in advance. I happened to go to my online booking and to my surprise saw that the return date had changed. Why did they not inform us beforehand? Other passengers on the flight did not know about it in advance, and I met two passengers who only found out when they had reached the airport. - My luggage arrived dented and with a broken wheel, but Malaysian Airlines indicated it does not compensate for this either. It took 2 weeks for Malaysian Airlines to get back to my complaint, with a message saying I will receive no compensation under ""Article 10.01"" of ""Conditions of Carriage"". And it turns out the person didn't even read my complaint or check the flight history, because it acknowledged only one of my four cancelled flights. Malaysian Airlines staff on the phone and at the airports were unhelpful, saying they cannot do anything for me - not even allowing me to change my seat, having lost my original selection due to the rescheduling. - They did not indicate the reason for the first two cancellations, only the return cancellations - very unprofessional. The online booking system rejected two credit cards, a call with my bank indicated their online system was at fault, and ran into similar issues booking by phone - before a umptieth time it finally went through.  I've had quite a few cancellations before, that was not the issue, but this is the worst I have been treated as a passenger by any airline. The way it was handled - not responding or acknowledging my complaint, not even reading it and realizing there were 4 not 1 cancellations, and all the other things which went wrong indicating that the airline is unprofessional. It made me feel like I was nothing but a number in their system and they don't care at all about their passengers."

The interior was laid out in calming earth-tone shades of brown, with slightly worn faux leather seats. IFE touch screen on seatbacks, but bring your own headphones. I have always found the B737 touchscreens to be laggy and slow, and this was no different. Legroom was adequate. After departure, a quick hot meal was served (kung po chicken noodle) with bottled water. Crew were friendly and engaged throughout, helping a mother with a young baby rather than ignoring her. Overall, a pleasant short flight."

I sat in the front seat right behind business class, it was a midnight flight and I clearly had my expectations too high. Business class from my view was great, dimmed light and all, but economy was the worst, the whole long midnight flight was with the light on, it was so bright I couldn't sleep. The manager, a lady stewardess was so scary, she was so loud and rude, the lady sat next to me put her phone on airplane mode and she was (I believe) browsing her photos in her album, and this manager shouted at her to put it off and said, ""I say off, not airplane mode"" to her a few times, my neighbour looked korean and I think her English wasn't that good, but as a stewardess you don't have to shout so many times.

As a result Bags were left in KL as they could not transfer to new flight due to the late arrival. Definitely need to re-think their ticket sales and or scheduling on this route. Slow service and no alcohol and certainly not up to the standard of a OneWorld Airline. Essentially once a full service airline now trading as a budget carrier.

The seating system allows some upgrade passenger to select the same seat as mine. Neither the staff at check-in counter nor booking system were aware of this. It is only when someone challenges me while I am still seated did I realise that the seat had been double assigned. As I am travelling with a companion we would like to be seated together. However, the upgraded passenger insists on the ""paid upgraded seat"" with rising their voice demanding the right to his paid seat from the ground staff. I was made to stand for 15 minutes watching this drama. The chief FA was just careless. Eventually, one this was settled I had been reassigned another seat. Unprofessional ground staff, crew members, check-in system."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Adelaide to Shanghai via Kuala Lumpur,May 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,  Adelaide to Shanghai via Kuala Lumpur. Very disappointed with the whole flight. Pretty much non-existence service. Due to an allergy had ordered a seafood meal. This was most disgusting. Scrambled eggs a piece of white fish and a hash brown. Missed coffee service. Had to call. Then after a long period I went on to order a drink. When I rang for service the flight attendants response was a yes as if why are you bothering us. West Coast of Australia and I was informed no more service as the bar in now closed. With over 4 hours of flight this is not normal.  Snack time and again I got no beverage service - passengers received an ice cream. Not me. Part 2 Delayed. Give a MR20/- dinner voucher for dinner that cost almost two times as much for something decent. New schedule time is 5 hour delay. Smart as international flight rules state a free overnight accommodation over 5 hours.
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Phuket,May 2018,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,3,yes,7,"  Departing KLIA on the morning flight to Phuket. Flight left on time, and boarding was uncomplicated. Aircraft was the newer B737-800 series, with spacious overheads, LED lighting and IFE in the seatback. Legroom was adequate without being overly generous, and because the flight wasn't full, the overall comfort level for the 1:15 min flight was good. A light snack was served, consisting of bottled water, croissant sandwich and muffin, but hot drinks were not offered. Crew were not especially engaged, but perhaps it's difficult to be cheerful when doing short hop trips. However, MAS's aim to encompass Malaysian hospitality has a little way to go, based on this experience."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur International Airport,May 2018,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,4,no,4," Pros: 1) Frequent, direct flights for the LHR-KUL route 2) Competitive prices for their Economy Promo seats compared to the Economy Smart/Premium and other airlines with a 30 kg check-in baggage (multiple bags) allowance included. These however come with limitations (see below). Cons: 1) Travellers booked on Economy Promo seats, on top of having limited choices for their times/dates for flying and having to book a non-changeable/refundable trip early, will not be allowed the option to select their preferred seat 24-48 hours during the online check-in process as seat allocations are automatic and controlled by the airport airline counters (particularly for the KUL-LHR leg). This means that frequent, solo travellers with seat preferences or travellers in groups/families are inconvenienced by having to request for a change of seat at the airport counter during the 2 hour window prior to boarding on the day of their flight, or will have to pay more to select their seat of choice during the booking process (which reduces the difference from the discount of booking a Economy Promo seat in the first place). This contrasts to what other airlines are offering, I found the majority of other airlines still provide a complimentary seat selection upon checking in 24 hours prior (with 23-30 kg baggage allowance). 2) The cost of the MHUpgrade to Business Class after booking an Economy seat amounts to more than purchasing a Business Smart seat early on in the first place. I was offered an MHUpgrade for both legs of my most recent flight in May 2018, but found that the minimum amount required to start a bid was a hundred pounds more than the original price to book a Business Smart seat, excluding the price of the original cost of the ticket paid. This marketing strategy made no sense to me. 3) Frequent flyers are not allowed to utilise their miles/points to pay for seat selections or upgrades on top of paying cash for seat tickets. This further limits the usefulness of accrued loyalty points with this particular airline, which requires a significant amount of points for free flight ticket redemption (based on a normal price ticket and not applicable for Promo fares). 4) The recent change from the Airbus A380 (with the possibility of selecting an Economy seat on the quieter upper deck section with a comfortable 2-4-2 configuration) to the new Airbus A350-900 with a 3-3-3 configuration with smaller seats/legroom as well as cramped and reduced number of toilets located at the far end of each section of the economy aisles (long way to walk from the kids bassinet seats up front). 5) Fly-from-Heathrow only, which means those who are based further up north of England may need to allocate 3-4 hours prior for travelling down to Heathrow. This may negate the time saved when using a direct flight vs. using other alternative airlines with connecting flights. Overall, Despite using Malaysia Airlines exclusively over the last 10 years for this particular route; its increasing disadvantages and discouraging airline loyalty programme provides serious reconsideration in continuing the use of this airline. My recent encounters with the customer service team based in Malaysia over technical difficulties/issues during my online check-in process last September 2017 and their lack of interest/feedback following their own teams' advice over the counter to submit an online complaint has also allowed me to think twice now before booking with this airline in the future."

Absolutely no alcoholic beverages on an international flight in business class even? Also, no personal TVs, only the kind that come down from the ceiling. This is absolutely ridiculous for anything that is dared to be called ""business class"" on any airline, and that's a lot coming from someone who routinely flies terrible airlines based out of the US. Malaysia Airlines needs to step up their game if they're going to try to keep surviving in the Asian airline market. The other ones out there are far, far superior; it's not even close. "

Happens. But the way Malaysia Airlines handled the case is outrageous. They were able to deliver the luggage with the next flight, but I was already on a tour the next day. So I had to buy things for 3 days until I returned to Auckland to access my luggage.  I filed a claim to get a refund for the costs I incurred in early March. I did not hear anything from them for 4 weeks. Then I tried to email the person who had replied to my claim. The person doesn't seem to work there anymore, as the email was returned immediately. All email addresses provided on Malaysia Airlines website don't work. The phone number provided for mishandled lugagge works, but in a dozen attempts I have never reached anyone. Then I called the general number. They said they would forward me. I'm in the line for about 5 minutes and then I'm kicked out. This happened three times. I tried to go through the website again, but all I get is a confirmation of receipt for my claim, but nobody seems to process the case after that. Nobody seems to be responsible for anything, nobody can be reached, wrong email addresses, numbers under which you can't reach anyone. It's an absolute mess. I find it hard to find the right words to describe the level of incompetence. I have spent so much time on the phone trying to resolve the case. The phone bill probably already exceeds what I could've hoped for as a refund for the costs I incurred. I will never fly with this airline again."

It took me quite a while during the check in at Incheon. The check in process was very unorganised and chaotic with extreme long queue. Inflight crew service was exceptional. It can be further improved, however with the better inflight entertainment system. The On Demand service offered was kind of dated and the IFE system for the whole cabin actually stopped functioning in the third half of the flight. I hope to see some refurbishment of A380 cabin in the near future in order for the airlines to stay competitive. I was seated at the Upper Deck of Economy Cabin. Aircraft deployed (9M-MND) was a little dated with visible masking tape taped on the interior flight equipment (ie. Lavatory & Cabin). The tray table was dirty and poorly maintained at its hygiene standard. Inflight catering offered was exceptionally good. I opted for the beef with kimchi rice, the portion was generous but the entree and dessert could be further improved. Cake was served as dessert but it was way too sweet! No fruit was served in this flight sector. Nonetheless, the cabin crews did a good job and definitely, the outstanding Malaysian Hospitality was delivered. Please keep this up!"

✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to London Heathrow,April 2018,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1,no,4," The bag drop off experience at KL airport was chaotic: We had done online check-in, which left us to drop our bags off. Some people already had tags with them but there weren't any machines in the terminal to print them out - so we asked for assistance. The Malaysia Airlines assistant was alone and crawling under requests, she advised we only had to queue but was not convincing at all in her advice. During the flight, my boyfriend and I were instructed in a very directive way to sit down (whilst stretching our legs at the back of the flight because the back of the plane was for crew only). This was pretty strange as every other flight we've ever flown has allowed people to walk up and down and stretch their legs if needed even at the back of the plane. The thing that was most off-putting was the way we were spoken to (which I'd describe as being outright rude). We incurred an hours delay for take off on the 1st leg and 30 min on the return leg. We had breakfast (omelette, fruit juice, fruits and yogurt) at 1pm KL time when we expected lunch. We were also told that we had no option, as they were out of any other options. Other passengers also complained about this fact. After breakfast I went to ask for some peanuts, but I was told ""No, later"" by one of the stewardesses - whom I'm assuming was the Chief Stewardess. First of all, we did not have a choice for ""lunch"" and then to be declined a little snack after, when MAS fares are higher than other carriers (who also serve more food) is disappointing. We found the cabin crew to be really direct and lacked good customer service skills. It's a shame as we've flown with MAS before and have always thought that they were a great airline. We're more than disappointed flying with them this time around from LHR-KUL and back again. The plane was a A350, KL0004 on Wednesday April 12th 2018 departing 09.50 AM from KL to LHR We have decided never to fly with MAS again. The experience is a disappointment and truly a shame for such an airline company with high potential. We will go back to flying with Emirates or Etihad in the future- as they are more affordable and as a customer, you come away feeling as you have been treated like a customer vs. being ""cattle""."

My flight was on 29th March 2018 to Kuala Lumpur and after the halt of 3 hours from Kuala Lumpur to Denpasar. The flight was in a very good condition, with in house entertainment with all the latest movies and songs. Above all special care was taken about the safety with proper announcements from time to time. Great leg space was there in the economy class. Just one issue they have to be mare careful about baggage handling. They also provided 30 kg free baggage and served foods and drinks. So my experience was very good will travel in future also"

Both legs on the ageing B737-800’s. Check-in was fast and friendly, but the counters opens only 120 minutes prior to take off, which is too narrow timeslot. Flights punctual to perfection. This is my 20th flight with Malaysia Airlines and I have had no delays nor luggage problems with them. On the contrary, they have helped me effectively from their help-desk if I want to make changes. Always easy to make changes with Malaysia Airlines. I love these big, thickly bolstered seats in the 737’s. Cabin crew were professional and very friendly. Special meal pre-ordered and given. Tried also one of their three options of hot food from the menu cards given to all passengers in business class. Would have appreciated a glass of wine, but not even a simple beer could be provided. Hate this imposing alcohol ban on a prestigious airline – that put them into same category as Egypt Air, PIA, Saudia Arabian, and alike. They have lost a lot of passengers due to that policy though they may also have gained a few. The airline seems to be on its rise and the new lounges in KLIA are impressive and nice. Lounge access in KLIA is almost unlimited, I tried three of their Golden Lounges. Sublime standards. Luggage delivered very quickly. All this for a very decent price-tag making it a pleasure for me to take this big detour from PNH till SGN. Miles and flyer tier points given."

Aircraft are changed A330-300 to A380-800. Usually, bigger aircraft is better than small one, but A380-800 isn’t good. I think Malaysia Airlines don’t want to continue to use A380, so they won’t update A380’s cabin. Inflight entertainment is terrible for Japanese; only English or Malay, only limited contents provided for Japanese. My seats display was a little bit broken and I cannot see the camera view (vertical tail camera). Seats are not bad, upper deck is better. Food is absolutely atrocious. I chose terrible tasting chicken spaghetti. Even pickles are unpalatable. It’s cheap ticket, but I don’t want to chose Malaysia Airline again. If your baggage can go in the cabin, you should chose LCC. KUL-BKK flight is better than NRT-KUL."

Today the plane has technical issues forcing and passengers have to deplane and change gates. Only to wait at the new gate because no security is in place! This is over and above the usual ""technical issues"" of headphone sockets partially working. I've flown them for years and they are getting worse. I've not had a flight that leaves on time in the past year. If you're not flying for business they are cheap and that's likely the only good thing. Otherwise if you have to rely on MAS to be on time and clean my suggestion is look elsewhere. Old, tired planes, lack of cleanliness and generally all round a poor experience."

Hi Chi Minh City to Phnom Penh via Kuala Lumpur for less than 170 USD on a lazy Sunday on 11/3 2018. I came terribly late to check-in in SGN due to narrow domestic connection with Vietnam Airlines to bSGN. But they embraced me and took care of me despite official check-in time was gone (arrived 35 Min. before departure). Check-in smooth. They facilitated me by assigning a person to let me quick thru immigration (saved me 15 Minutes!). Then, unfortunately I had to go back as they found a lighter when scanning my suitcase. Then I had to go 500 meters back and clear out two ignition-lighters from my luggage – this is an airport issue – but MH staff supported me to manage me to go through all steps (inc. re-entering immigration, sec. checks, and gate-boarding- quickly). Trips were basically on time – MH never let me down . Good movies, good headsets, special food provided, courteous staff, and clean (despite ageing B-737) aircrafts. Luggage arrived as one of the first bags in PNH. Altogether, a breeze travelling with this airline. Huge classic business-class-seats provided (room for 2-3 persons!) on these ageing B-737’s. Menu cards provided on both legs – three options offered beyond my special meals ordered. Acceptable food provided (not very high class- but many options) and renewed IFE on both legs with good hear-sets provided. The new lounges in KLIA are fabulous! Paid close to economy class for these business legs and am so happy to do the detour via KUL despite it consumes most of a day. No alcoholic drinks provided apart from KLIA-lounges. However, I love this airline – and prey on their low prices at promotions. Got loads of miles."

As a regular flyer the service and attention to detail was outstanding from start to finish. Take off was on-time, and landed 10 minutes early. The crew were wonderful, being attentive and caring. While I was sleeping one of the crew noticed I was not using a blanket, and I woke up to find one had been gently placed over me. The call button was answered within 20 seconds, something which is often absent on many airlines. I am particular about food, but in this case I have absolutely no complaints at all. Alcohol was served after takeoff and I was regularly checked for a refill if needed. The IFE was probably the most responsive I have experienced in many years of flying, certainly the equivalent of Emirates, but without the choice. The toilets were kept spotless at all times. A thoroughly enjoyable experience in all regards."

Seats narrow, thin and lack depth so no support under lower thigh. Armrests narrow and very hard. Installed very close to seat in front which if reclined means a screen literally in your face. If over 1.8m tall your knees will be pressed against seatback in front. All together very uncomfortable. I have seen a lot of hype about the ""awesome"" A350 cabin. Don‘t fall for it. Malaysia Airlines has modelled its economy cabin for maximum revenue not passenger comfort. Cabin crew - like some planes they looked worn out and tired. Robotic and clearly intent on performing their work to maximise their non-passenger contact and sleeping time. Rushed through cabin not giving opportunity to ask for service. No pleasantness or genuine smiles. Cabin was left completely unattended for part of flight and with only one crew for much of flight. No cabin service. Help yourself from galley. Only water and biscuits available. Some very irritating behaviour: male crew especially. I find it offensive to be served by someone who thinks he is on a stage in the role of a drag queen. Seat belt sign switched on during meal service but no turbulence. Hot drink service suspended. You can get a hot drink after your meal but not with it. Says it all about quality of MAS today. Entertainment system broke down late into flight. Toilets very small and not cleaned often enough (but then you can't clean a toilet if you are sleeping). Food OK. Not a word from the Captain for whole of flight. Plenty of better airlines fly into KUL. Have used MAS for last 30 years through good times and bad but no more. "

Would be very reluctant to fly Malaysia Airlines again. First issue was online checkin - we had booked seats 2 months prior and paid for them, when we went to checkin we were given really bad seats at the back of the plane. When we called they said there was nothing they could do. We then asked for a refund, after some arguments they said they would process it and we would get it in 3 months time! Second issue at checkin -it took over an hour to drop our bags off. The flight was  delayed by about 1.5 hours so left at 2am. The plane was old, food very average, the toilet I used was not clean, old screens with limited entertainment. There was quite a bit of leg room in economy and the seat configuration was 2-4-2 so was nice to sit just with my husband. We got a super good deal on our flights but should have paid the couple of hundred more to go on another airline."

Boarding: Straight-forward boarding process in KLIA. There are not that many passengers so it is quick. Flight: It appeared to be a new aircraft judging from the shine and design of the overhead lockers. On sitting down I opened the tray and out fell on a half-eaten cake in a paper cup. I called the cabin crew who took it from me and walked away without an apology. I had to call her back to arrange for the tray to be cleaned. She behaved that she was doing me a favour clearing up this mess. As this was the 1st flight of the day for the plane. Obviously, the interiors were not cleaned properly. I find this unacceptable and the standards of the airline deteriorated recently. The flight was uneventful. The meal served was reasonably tasty for a regional flight. Arrival: The luggage arrived soon after disembarkation from the plane."

When I sat down in the seat, I could smell urine. As the plane was full, I decided not to move. There was also a smell of urine when I opened the toilet door. We were offered meat or fish. I asked for meat. The reply was we have run out of meat and there is only fish. Why offer a choice when there is no choice. The fish was cooked in a batter. This had adsorbed the gravy and the dish was dry and tasteless.  I complained to the cabin crew and they gave me the address of customer service. When I got home, I wrote to customer service to describe the poor quality of food and the poor maintenance of the airplane. After a long process of establishing my identity, the reply came back- please complain this to the cabin crew. I had complained to the cabin crew who asked me to complain to Customer Services. When I take it up with Customer Services, they ask me to complain to the Cabin Crew. This is a ridiculous situation of passing the buck."

She could not remember where it was. I did not see staff helping her or re-seating her to somewhere near the galley where they could keep an eye on her. Later I saw her trying to open the toilet door. I had to help her open the door.  In my opinion, I do not think it is a satisfactory situation of passenger care. "

Golden Lounge was undergoing renovation so we were directed to the regional lounge which was small and cramped and very hot. Boarding gate was woefully inadequate for a large aircraft. There was no aerobridge to the upper floor so we climbed the stairs inside the plane which would not work well for people with mobility problems. The cabin was dated and scruffy and about 30% occupied. Staff were disinterested in their passengers and were in a hurry to get the dinner service over. No menus were offered until I asked. Drinks were given out begrudgingly. Once dinner was over, no offer of dessert instead the table linen was whisked away. Lights out and I turned down the bed which proved hard and uncomfortable. The gaps in the seat made it hard to sleep on despite the thin mattress given out. Breakfast was offered and my choice was not available despite it being a relatively empty cabin. I had the Chinese dim sum which was dry and overcooked. I used my Enrich miles to upgrade my ticket but based on what I received, I would not purchase a Business class ticket with this carrier. Using the Enrich miles was also difficult as they make it almost impossible to upgrade due to all sorts of conditions. Staff were efficient but not friendly and never smiled."

Check in at Adelaide was slow as check in staff were engaging in conversations with passengers. This is a nice touch but it just slows people down. Once on board, everything worked well. Staff were efficient and responded to requests quite promptly but were clearly disinterested in their passengers and never smiled once during the flight. I wonder if the morale of Malaysia Airlines cabin crew is deteriorating? The food was good and adequate but the in flight entertainment is not extensive. The flight left and arrived bang on time. Uneventful and everything went off well."

Flight from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur delayed by 2.5hrs. Passengers who had connecting flights, or meetings begged the staff at the MH transit counter to put them on a Singapore Airlines code sharing flight which was refused. I was lucky enough that I had 4hr layover in Kuala Lumpur. Flight to KL was on a rather tired looking Boeing 737. FA's were rather robotic and not overly friendly. Golden Lounge in KL was still under renovation despite different information given on the MH website claiming that it opened on the 20th  February. Replacement lounge shockingly basic. Service on the long flight was similar as on the short flight. Food and seat was decent. Flight arrived on time, IFE poor. MH has been constantly on the decline over the last few years, but this was the new low point due to the handling with the delay, and the not very friendly staff."

The flight departed at about 1.00am Malaysian time and took about 5-hours. Right after take off, breakfast was served. As expected, many passengers refused service as it was about 2.00am. I think they should move the service to about 2-hours before landing. IFE and seats were okay. Cabin crew were professional but not too friendly."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Colombo via Kuala Lumpur,January 2018,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," I was due to travel an 8hr flight with my wife and 20 month old daughter from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur at 3.15pm then have a few hours layover in KL followed by a 3hr flight to Colombo. We were informed that this flight was cancelled and rescheduled at the airport and asked to line up as normal at the check in counter (which took 1hr) just to be told to come back at 9am the next day for the rescheduled flight. There were no staff to inform us of the reasons why the flight was rescheduled to anxious passengers lining up. We were told to call the Malaysia Airlines number to find out the flight info (they were not going to contact us). I called the number and was informed that not only was it going to be a 9am flight (which we particularly didn't want due to having a 20 month old up all day on a plane) but we would also now have a 9hr layover in KL (compared to the original 3hr layover). They stated that they would provide accommodation and meals for the layover and we would be met by an attendant when we arrived in Malaysia. Further, they did not send the new flight details until I called up and requested them. So we got to the airport the next day at 9am and checked in. But due to a ""comment"" on the online system they couldn't print out my wife's connection boarding pass so we would have to get that from KL. Then the flight was not only delayed by 2hrs but we also had to be bussed to the aircraft which was in a disgusting condition. Dirty floor, toilets etc. It was obviously thrown together at last minute. The explanation for the delay was that the catering was late (ironically the food was also the worst I have ever had on an airline). We also had to fight to get the baby meals we requested for our daughter. When we arrived in KL, no one was there to met us and they had not orgainsed the accommodation, which had to be organised by staff at the transfer desk who didn't seem to know what was going on. Then the group (others who were in our position) that had to be accomdated was not escorted to the hotel but just given directions. They had also forgotten to include a meals allowance which I had to get the hotel to follow up on. Additionally, the boarding procedures were unbelievably disordered, passengers were not called up by seat area and instead allowed to pile onto the plane creating chaos within the aircraft. On board the plane we found that most of the attendants seemed annoyed when passengers asked them for assistance and some were overtly rude. In sum, minimal explanations, no financial reimbursement, no benefits, poor service, communication and organisation. This was an awful experience and I won't be flying with them again. I understand that sometimes flights have to be rescheduled but the lack of professionalism in its management was unbelievable! "

And instead giving customers food and drinkat the waiting area all the passengers had to go to a counter wait in a line for an hour to get a Food coupon for 20 Ringits that's around 4 Euros and in a Airport where everything is $$$ and plus you have only one Restaurant where to go. After ordering another 30 minutes only to find out that is the most disgusting Restaurant.

Cabin was extremely hot. Either the aircraft air conditioning system was not functioning well or the airline wants to save costs on not handing out blankets and pillows which they did in the past. I noticed not only on this trip but on several trips as well. Please fix the air conditioning. Very uncomfortable. Lots of passengers with huge and heavy pieces of luggage who kept trying to force them into the overhead compartment. Not nice.

Ticket bought on-line MHs website very cheap. PNH-airport: check-in was slow and opens only 2 hours prior departure in 3 lanes – not enough! It took 30 minutes to check me in as I was proceeding from SGN to Africa on other OneWorld tickets and needed BP and luggage checked throughout. That created a lot of confusion as nobody in the Airport knew about these destinations and were internally disagreeing on the rules and thus hesitating to allow me to check-in the whole way. Eventually they – somehow hesitant – agreed. A problem is that 3rd party agents are doing the check-in and they are neither very professional nor quick nor able to take any decision. Onboard, spacious seats give. Special meal was given only on the 2nd leg. Food was fine and delicious, menu cards were given out and three options of hot food. Pre-departure drinks offered, no alcoholic offered, but the lounges they offer at KLIA and in PNH have plenty. Golden Lounge (“Regional”, at main terminal) have 2 sparkling wines, one cava and one champagne. The cava is the best despite likely being four times cheaper than the champagne. FAs onboard were all in a good mood, pro-active, courteous and observant. Faultless travels, punctual, luggage generous and well handled. Special meal noted (on one leg) and elite status respected."

We have travelled to Malaysia with MH more often than I would care to remember and we have always been very happy with the service provided. However, sadly not on this occasion, we were very disappointed. The standard has certainly dropped. FA gave us the impression that they would rather be somewhere else even though they try hard to be pleasant. I pre-ordered our meal through ""book the cook"" and the meal was of poor standard and the menu has been reduced to only four choices and to rub salt into the wound, I was only given a spoon with my meal. The wine at meal time was only served on request. The return journey to Sydney was no better. Malaysia is our favourite destination and we hope to visit Malaysia as often as we can but next time it will be with SIA. The only bright aspect of our flight was the use of the QANTAS Lounge. Outstanding!"

I have tried my best to support Malaysia Airlines over the past few years and found they were always good despite their troubles and cutbacks but I must admit this lastest business class trip was extremely disappointing and really puts their standing into doubt. The first thing I noticed is that their system no longer allows you to select a seat using online check-in. Surely this helps the check in process at the airport as it’s 1 less thing for check-in staff to have to do. I know they have removed alcohol from their shorter flights and this needed to be addressed as some years ago you were offered alcohol on a 1 hour domestic flight at 7.30 in the morning! Obviously ridiculous and unnecessary. But this was a mid afternoon international business class flight, I don’t intend getting completely drunk on a flight but it is nice to have a wine with dinner on an international flight, especially in business class, this is very disappointing. They seem to be really penny pinching and slowly getting worse and worse, there is little that is endearing me to them any more and so they will no longer be my automatic first choice, they don’t deserve the custom."

I had a restful flight on the Airbus 330-300 and the cabin crew were very attentive. The signature satay is not to be missed, and don't be embarrassed to ask for more. However, from Kuala Lumpur to Taipei, it was only a Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Cabin crew were great, but the seats were old-school business class seats - they were not lie-flat ones. During our layover in KUL, the flagship Golden Lounge was closed for renovations. So, we had to use a smaller lounge."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Perth,January 2018,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,2,no,4, Simply unacceptable for Malaysia Airlines to operate a single-aisle plane on a 5.50 hour long flight from Kuala Lumpur to Perth. Was a horrible experience especially after flying from Europe. Price was 2.5% more than usual due to holiday pricing. So many airline options flying from Perth. Use them!
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to London Heathrow,December 2017,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,4.0,5,yes,6," This is the second time I have flown the Kuala Lumpur - London Heathrow with Malaysia Airlines since 2013. I had checked in online and printed my boarding pass, and in the end I had the seat I initially choose. Inside of the aircraft was rather clean and tidy, their blanket was nice and cozy and earphones were comfortable to wear. The displayed information regarding the safety instructions is easy to reach. Toilets are very clean as well and the cabin crews on this particular flight were rather pleasant and responded quickly to my request. The flight overall was quiet though there was some turbulence, to be fair this is beyond the airlines control. I unfortunately felt under the weather during the flight and the crews were able to accommodate my requests. A couple of issues which could be improved is that their entertainment system is certainly not the easiest to navigate. I ended up taking out my laptop to work and listen to my own music instead of using their system. The food they provided has fallen below par with the reputation they had, whilst the food is served warm, it certainly lacks flavour. You get what you pay for, the price they offered for this particular trip was competitive enough for me to take it. For a 13 hours plus flight I did have the amenities they promised and did not regret my decision. To summarise, ""Good value for money, but a lot of areas could be improved""."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Business,Business Class,Ho Chi Minh City to Phnom Penh via Kuala Lumpur,January 2018,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,5.0,5,yes,9," Travelled SGN-KUL-PNH, 10 Jan 2018 on one of their old B373-800. Ticket bought online, MHs website and the design and ticket issuing has been revamped and modernised. Takes me less than 10 minutes to buy a ticket and the price is clear and fixed from beginning till end. At SGN-airport, check-in was quick and perfect. Onboard, recommended by staff to change my seat to get a spacious section to myself, which is a pro-active, positive effort by the FAs. Pre-departure drinks offered. No alcoholic drinks on these short flights, but they normally allow discrete, modest consumption of own supplies. Food menu dished out. 3 hot dishes offered on flights less than 100 minutes. Had a wonderful noddle-prawn dish (mee Siam), which went down with pleasure. Offered sparkling water, and they gave me a full bottle and inserted a lemon boat to beef it up – well done. FA's were courteous and observant. IFE excellent, quality headphone dishes out. Lounge access granted in Saigon (""Apricot"") and in KLIA (""Golden regional""), both lounges of high quality. Basically a 5-star experience, though the ageing aircraft and limitation of drink varieties deduct a little bit on rating. Went on a sales ticket (“End of Year”-promotion) from MH-website and paid only 148 usd for these 2 legs (287 USD/return). Faultless travel - a true gift. The proof is that I spend gladly ½ day travelling this huge deviation between SGN and PNH instead of going direct which takes only 1 hour. Furthermore, I earned a substantial amount of miles to my OneWorld FFP-card, inserted within 6 days."
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to London Heathrow,January 2018,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,3.0,4,yes,8," Kuala Lumpur to London Heathrow. Excellent service, food has improved. The staff has been great. They offer friendly attentive service and did many drinks round. During the flight, the passenger in front of me spilled coffee over her shirt. The crew noticed it and swiftly passed her a wet towel. They also responded to an array of unusual drink requests efficiently, all with a smile. I fly frequently between Kuala Lumpur and London. The flight time is 13.5 hours. In the past, Malaysia Airlines tend to serve a hot meal 2 hours after departure, a snack 6 hours after departure, then another hot meal 10 hours departure. As a result, some passengers can feel hungry between the 2 hot meals service. On this occasion, the inflight supervisor announced that they are trialling a new meal service timing. This time the first hot meal was served 2 hour after take-off. The second hot meal was moved forward, being served around 7 or 8 hours after take off. Then, they handed out a snack box for passengers to consume at their leisure. A few hours later, they also handed out packs of peanuts. Passengers didn't feel the hunger and in fact I noted my fellow passengers joked that the airlines keep on feeding them. I like this new service. It also increases the cabin crew service frequency. I also noted the snack box has improved both in terms of quantity and quality. It used to be a pack of nuts plus a slice of cake. Now, it consist of a croissant with meat filling plus a chocolate. For the vegetarian, they get a foccacia filled with ratatouille. The thin blankets have also been replaced with warmer fleece blanket. The food quality has improved. We were served chicken satay with fried rice! Nonetheless, there are still room for improvement to the food, such as in the presentation and introducing healthier salad, as done by Delta Airlines. Overall, the Malaysia Airlines is taking steps to improve the customer experience."

Firstly our plane was delayed by an hour. Once the plane arrived I realized that the plane was so small compared to the one we came with. The IFE wasn’t even updated because on the KL to Jakarta flight there were more movies. The flight wasn’t that bad though. 5 hours later we landed in KL, since our flight was the next day we decided that we should look around KL. The next day our flight was at 6 pm, we woke up had breakfast and did some shopping and then headed to the airport. As the connection was less than 24 hours the checked in bags stayed at the airport. Again the plane was small, but we were not concerned as it was a 2 hr flight. Once we landed we were walking to the conveyer belt when we realized that 3/4 of our bags were at the lost and found. On the tag it said MH725 the correct one and a sticker on top of it with the word Rush and MH711 which is the early morning flight. We were missing our last bag so we checked with the staff about our bag. They checked it in the system and it said file not found. We finally got it on the conveyor belt as the last baggage."

Lounge in KUL also good though only the Golden Lounge in main terminal was open and only from 05 o’clock morning. Slept in the open terminal. Onboard seating next to my son was automatically granted. Special meals accommodated. IFE does not work well but was OK. FA's were professional. Good information from captain. Luggage (3 pieces) arrived smoothly. No alcohol on the short sector. A big minus is that they stopped serving people already 1 full hour prior to landing – this is a mean cost cutting measure, and it came cowardly without any prior notice."

My second time flying with Malaysia Airlines. Check-in counters at Changi Airport supposed to be opened 3 hours before the departure time, but were opened 2 hours before the departure time. We had to queue and we waited for almost an hour before the counters opened. I was disappointed with the ground crew - however, the cabin crew is friendly.

PVG to KUL on A330. Cabin was spacious and complete clean. Cabin crew was friendly, attentive and professional. Food was tasteful. The only complaint is that seat is a bit narrow and I could not find good sleep position. I was seated 7K. Maybe I have to choose 7A for my next trip. Anyway it was a very pleasant flight. From KUL to LHR on A380. Cabin was spacious but terribly messy. My seat was full of bread crumbs and dust. It was a flight starting from Malaysia Airlines hub. I could not understand how cabin had been cleaned. Cabin crew was efficient but not so attentive, because of midnight flight? Seat was quite comfortable. But seat topper and quilt were not comfortable at all. One more complaint I was their food. I pre-ordered seafood meal. But all meals I got on both flights, including breakfast before arriving at LHR were the same, the same fish! Incredible! Two flights on the same airline on the same day gave me two totally different impression. I have flown Malaysia Airlines several times  in C class. I would expect that KUL to LHR flight was an exception."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Sandakan via Kuala Lumpur,December 2017,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,2," London to Sandakan via Kuala Lumpur. I am truly sorry we booked flights with Malaysia Airlines. Please read to make sure you do not make the same mistakes we did. We booked flights for our annual travels and had a very stressful experience, mainly due to the lack of customer service. Our aircraft was delayed from London Heathrow by 4 hours and 15 minutes. We then missed our connecting flight from Kuala Lumpur to Sandakan. We arrived in Sandakan a total of 9 hours late. Our luggage was lost en route and not returned for 48 hours. Customer services were rude and unwilling to help track the luggage. In their own words it was not their responsibility to help and there was no telephone number for the department who could help. On top of our booking for international flights between UK and Borneo, we added a domestic flight from Sandakan to Kota Kinabalu which cost £40 for two people. Because of the lost luggage and disrupted flights our tours were disrupted and we had to re plan our trip. We needed to rebook the domestic flight but were advised it would cost us £700 (to reschedule a £40 flight). We requested to miss the flight so we could just book flights with another airline but were still told we needed to pay £700. If not they would cancel our flights back to UK automatically. This was a part of the terms and conditions we signed up to apparently. No one from customer service was willing to have a rational discussion about it. To avoid the £700 charge, we actually took the internal flight and then booked flights back to origin (Sandakan) to continue our rescheduled trip. It felt like Malaysian Airlines had actually lost the plot. We spent a day flying when they could have just cancelled the flights and let us fly with another carrier. We never requested a refund so our seats would have just gone empty or been used by other customers at no additional cost to them. The above is a lesson not to block book flights with Malaysia Airlines. If you need to make any minor changes (even if their fault), they will ruthlessly exploit you for cash and leave you in a state of high stress if you allow it to happen. Please make sure you book domestic flights separately which will give you flexibility in case your flights are disrupted. The USB charger in seats our row were all broken, so we couldn't charge our phones for when we arrived in Borneo and needed to call hotel for transfers. The in flight entertainment screen was broken so nothing to watch while stuck on the airrcraft for 18 hours. When asked if I could move seat to one with working screen and USB, I was told no. Legroom was small compared to Thai Airways so the flight was uncomfortable (fair enough, they were Economy tickets meaning I had apparently waivered my human rights anyway). The return flight was 4 hours late. The aircrew were all very nice people and did their best to help passengers. That was appreciated and this review is not to do with them. They are not to blame. Delays and disruption are an everyday part of travelling and I understand that. Having zero customer service and leaving customers stranded without support is not. I won't overestimate Malaysia Airlines again."
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Kuala Lumpur to London Heathrow,December 2017,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,3.0,5,yes,9,"  Kuala Lumpur to London Heathrow. Early morning check in experience similar to that for REP previously reviewed, it would be so much more pleasing with a raceway system. Priority immigration a misnomer with one manned desk to serve premium passengers for all airlines, not Malaysia Airlines fault but general immigration for non-Malaysians and security would be far less stressful with raceways. As has been previously reported the Golden Wing in the satellite terminal is being modernised; the CIP alternative does not do MH service - limited seating, paper tubs in lieu of plates, plastic cutlery and no toilet facilities other than the disgusting offering on the concourse below. Entry to the departure lounge includes second security check, documentation check followed by direction to the upper lounge. Welcome onboard and directed to the 18 seat forward J cabin which is quite intimate, amenities, headset, menu, mattress, pillow and duvet at each seat - which is far superior to that in the A330s. Welcome soft drink followed by selection of main course for the brunch. My wife had the last Nasi Lemak and the flight attendant appeared genuinely remorseful that I had to take my second option - Spanish omelette. To make amends she returned within five minutes to take my lunch selection - nice touch. Push back about 45 minutes late but my guess is that is technical so that the arrival slot at LHR is on time and avoids fuel wastage holding over Kent. Post brunch there was a selection of both hot and cold snacks on request, as were alcoholic drinks. About four hours before landing the signature satay dish was served followed by the drinks trolley then somewhat bemusingly tables were cleared until about two hours before landing when the second meal was served by the tray rather than by courses. On long daytime flights I try to avoid sleeping in the hope of a decent nights sleep after arrival and am content with a book, the flight map/info (the MH A380 system being one of the best I’ve seen) and watching the passing geography. Something I appreciate about Malaysia Airlines is that I’ve never had my blinds lowered against my wishes. By pure coincidence we used the same hotel at LHR as the crew, we met several of the cabin crew on the night of arrival and the following morning and were recognised and pleasantries exchanged."

Check in at REP by local agent was somewhat lengthy as the REP-KUL sector was electronically linked to a KUL-LHR leg for the following day, needing our bags for the overnight stay de-linking such that they would be available in KL proved a complicated process but was eventually achieved and all four bags were on the carousel when we arrived at KUL. The lounge in REP is used by multiple airlines and is a distinct improvement on the old lounge although poorly sign posted. Once inside it was virtually empty with ample seating and dining areas; it gave a feeling of exclusivity. There was a large selection of hot and cold dishes - not sampled in anticipation of a beef rendang for lunch onboard. A full bar service was available. Boarding was hassle free and the business cabin with the newer seating was half full. Warm welcome onboard, juice, newspaper and menu at seat. Early push back followed by anticipated rendang once airborne. Timely arrival into KUL, where Immigration was packed. Malaysia Airlines do not provide priority passes but there are dedicated First/Business lanes, the officer checks your boarding pass to authenticate use."

Was looking forward being on one of the first flights of their gorgeous new A350. The hardware was great, but what a disaster otherwise. Flight took off 1h 40 minutes late, no explanation or apology on the ground or on the plane, it was appalling. Food now even on international flight of 2hrs and above is a cardboard box kind of meal without an appetizer or desert. It’s basically like a low cost carrier. Staff not very friendly."

No apology, no offer to refund the ticket. This cut my short trip by over 16h and I had to endure a dreadful overnight flight on a plane with a 30"" seatpitch. I have been flying MH for over 30 years and thought things couldn’t get any worse, but they did it! Old and outdated 737-800 with poor seat pitch and entertainment box under the seat in front. Robotic and not very friendly FLight attendants. The only good about flaying with MH were the hearty curries they served. Overall, not again."

Everything went very smooth. The most annoying is that the airline has discontinued luggage cooperation with most airlines if booked on separate tickets. Thus, I had to struggle in HKG to take my luggage out and check it in again on another carrier. MH policy on no alcohol on stretches under 3 hours is patronising and humiliating. Lounges accessed in SGN and HKG were good. Flight SGN-KUL was good but on the older 737 aircraft. The only remaining MH-lounge in KUL (due to rebuilding of two of their lounges) closes at midnight and do not open until dawn. A third party “CIP lounge” is hired in to fill the gap but it is small and restricted. So had to sleep in a coach in the open terminal area until the real lounge opened at 5 a.m. KUL-HKG was on an A330 which was completely full but service was still top-notch. Special meals were delivered to perfection on all stretches. Additional meal tried out as some were in excess - these were also good. Lounge allowance generous. IFE good. Seat space very good. I was allocated seats next to my son without additional request and did not even have to mention it. A pleasant experience and the few hiccups must be tolerated as the price is very competitive."

Aircraft has aged but clean and well maintained. However it is real time for MH to up its game and change to Boeing 737 MAX 8. No back seat screen for IFE nor USB port to charge devices. Seat width and seat pitch is ok for a short haul flight. Seat comes with adjustable headrest. Cabin crew announcement in both English and Bahasa Melayu is clear. Shortly after boarding, meal is served and the choice is between noodle with chicken and fish with rice. I choose the noodles. Food was overheat, portion is small and there were not enough sauce. Overall, an uneventful flight. Immigration at the domestic/international transfer counter at KLIA is a nightmare with 4 counters but only 3 open so advise to allow more time if transiting at KLIA from a domestic destination. Disappointed MH is deploying a Boeing 737-800 NG on a medium haul flight. Aircraft is generally clean and tidy. There is backseat TV screen but no headrest. Comes with pillow, blanket and headset. I was lucky to be seated at the emergency exit row so plenty of seat pitch, however sit width is not that great. Dinner is delayed due to air turbulence. Choice is: beef lasagna & chicken with rice. Choose beef lasagna. Comes with dinner roll, crackers, salad with ham and cheese cake. Broccoli was a little overcook but still looked green. Lasagna was flavourful and enough bolognese sauce. Cabin crew was friendly but none has stood out as an exceptional one. The IFE has quite a good range of genres to choose from, however the backseat TV screen is not so responsive."

There are many regional departures around this time and it appeared that all desks were operating, however, there was no raceway organisation and passengers were left to choose their queue of choice. On reaching the desk the Malaysian lady was helpful, efficient and personable but had no mechanical support and because her male colleague was busy elsewhere I had to do all the luggage manhandling onto the conveyor. In comparison immigration and security were quickly dealt with. The Regional lounge is in the main concourse and not easily found being located up an escalator above a coffee outlet and not sufficiently signposted. We were greeted on arrival but had considerable difficulty locating two adjoining seats, shortly thereafter there was a mass exodus and by 09.00 we felt we had the lounge to ourselves. The Regional lounge is dry (as are regional flights under 3 hours) but not a problem at that time of day. The breakfast offering, not sampled, was impressive and would compare favourably with first class hotels in the region. Calls are not made in the lounge and the departures board not kept up to date, not sure whose fault that is, suffice to say that at 09.45 the last flight on the board had departed 15 minutes earlier. The rule is to be at the gate 30 minutes prior to departure where there was another perfunctory security check. No Malaysian officials were at the departure lounge but it was spacious and relatively comfortable for a 737 full load. Boarding, once commenced, was by row number from the rear of the plane with J class and senior ffs when they wished. The cabin had 5 customers. A previous Malay national reviewer commented that being greeted and treated onboard was like being taken into the crew’s home and I can’t think of a better description of how the cabin attendant treated us throughout the flight. Juice or water prior to departure with that day’s newspaper in the seat pocket. Menu offered which included fruit starter, bakery and nasi lemak or western breakfast. Pushback on time flight deck briefing on the flight followed by uneventful trip to Siem Reap. The planes are showing their age in the cabin but the 2-2 wide seat arrangement beats the regular European offering of economy 3-3 with the centre seat empty. And the outstanding effort of the crew was what really counts."

Counter checkin after minimal wait pleasant staff issued tickets for pre-selected seats. Fast track through Immigration using chip technology worked for my wife but rejected me.  MH now use the QF lounge which at 1100 was the usual zoo (not MH fault just too many One World partners use the lounge greatly supplemented by QF Club members travelling in economy, QF should really consider on option whereby J customers get preferential treatment) but quickly thinned out; usual high standard of catering and beverages. Priority boarding worked efficiently, warmly greeted we settled into paired seating - right side alternating with the “throne” seats. I can understand the attitude of single travellers who are “paired” feeling “seen off” when compared with the “thrones”. The cabin was full but the dedicated crew of 4 worked efficiently and with a team spirt showing. Pre take off water or juice, menus already in the seat pocket together with headphones and hard shell amenities kit. Push back early with adequate information flow from the flight deck. Shortly after take off drinks were offered - choice of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages including champagne. The signature satay accompanied the second drinks round followed by lunch, we were seated toward the rear of the cabin and served towards the end but all options were still available - the celebrity chef designed nonya chicken was thigh meat and juicy. Cheese and biscuits were an option after or in lieu of dessert. A selection of ‘small’ dishes including Aussie meat pie were available post lunch until just prior to landing, similarly for those who wished drinks were available throughout though sadly the Sav Blanc ran out. I found the seat comfortable but did not use the lie flat feature, my wife who is vertically challenged would who’ve appreciated a longer leg/foot rest. Arrival in KL as close to schedule as to not matter, quick transfer from satellite to main terminal, immigration officials aplenty and no wait for formalities, luggage on the belt very shortly thereafter - mixed with baggage from the London flight - with priority bags first. It had been a couple of years since last using MH and reading some entries over the past months had me a little concerned about standards but our experience was faultless at SYD, onboard and at KUL."

I bought a heavily discounted business class ticket from an OTA where I need to change – OTA did not react so I had to contact MAS who did it for me in seconds for a modest fee of 0.53 USD. Check In on-line easy but superfluous if you have luggage. Check-in counter opens only 2 hours before departure for international flight. Loads of people were waiting in PNH as the traffic makes it too risky to count on arrival 2 hours before. Another bad point is the lack of alcohol offering onboard. The aircraft are pretty old and a bit worn though maintained. These 2-3 issues deduct 2 stars from the 10, so 8 is my conclusive score as the rest was superb: Lounges in PNH (Plaza Premium and Golden Lounge, respectively) were great and spacious. Especially the latter has got a huge facelift and has become big, with a bar, more presentable food, nap-areas, 1st class section, etc. Check-in a breeze. Prioritised at gate, at check-in and on board. Ordered special seafood meals delivered to perfection. Other three dishes offered on board. The winner was a delicious “mee Siam” spicy, fried noodle dish. Drinks offered and glass refilled even without request. Luggage delivered quickly. Generous luggage allowance. Boarding and disembarking at airbridges throughout despite being on small aircraft (B-737-800). All flights on time. FFP-Miles instated within a week. Extremely good value for money."

A tip is to check-in online through the Malaysia Airlines app or website to avoid the queue at the airport. The aircraft is generally clean and tidy despite it is quite old. There is a USB port to charge your iPhone or iPad and a TV screen and an inflight magazine for inflight entertainment. However, I am surprised that MH would deploy a Boeing 737-800 on a medium haul flight. I have travelled on this sector in the past and they were using Airbus 330-300. I was lucky to be given an emergency exit so I have plenty of extra legroom. There is no headrest in economy class but I fell asleep quickly, probably because it is a 2am flight and I am tired already. An hour into the flight, breakfast is served. The choice is nasi lemak and egg omelette. The signature Malaysian dish did not disappoint. The meal comes with a muesli bar, plain croissant, mango yoghurt and fresh fruit. The croissant was cold but the main dish is cooked to perfection, with the string beans still looking green and chicken curry was tender and delicious. The rest of the flight is uneventful and the flight arrived ahead of schedule, which is very rare for Malaysia Airlines."

The plane was all old, and the interior showed its age though. One particular thing: Meal is not served in a big disposable tray as other airlines, but in a smaller box, which means less food is served. My biggest disappointment was that, in the last 3 legs, food choice offered was all the same - rice with fish and chicken with noodle. Since I don't eat fish, I would always choose the latter, and the taste, serving and even looks are all even exactly the same every time in all those legs! Fortunately for me, the IFE worked fine, and overall the cabin service was not all that special, seat was OK but not bad though, so I didn't have anything to complain other than the food. I hear that Malaysia Airlines has declined considerably since the two tragic incidents in 2014, and as a result they had their budget cut. However, considering that they were once a five star airline, I didn't expect their service to drop drastically as such (no meal tray provided!). The good news is, they announce sales promo frequently, and now they are cheaper than before. So if you don't demand much of an airline service and you're in a budget, in Southeast Asia, MH is a flight you might consider."

Regional Flights on B737-800 throughout. I bought a heavily discounted business class ticket from a dubious online agency. Booked for 2 days earlier than actually travelled but could not make my domestic connection to SGN due to typhoons upcountry. Thus, had to cancel at the last minute and retime to 1-2 days later to be sure to catch the international flight as the typhoon was very persistent. While the OTA was useless, impossible to contact, and provided vertically no information apart from a ticket number and schedule, I was desperate and saw my ticket as likely lost. However, I made a call to MH directly (through Saigon Office) and they dealt with it professionally, took over the booking from the OTA, and rebooked me with amble time at almost no cost. And suddenly I could access my booking on their system and order seats and special meals etc. At check-in in Saigon everything went smooth and quick. I took me less than 5 minutes from arriving until I had all my boarding passes in hand. I thereupon had a positive chat with the check-in counter as they were not busy. Lounge is third-party and called Apricot, good service tarmac views, and cooperative lounge staff. A flight delay of 75 Minutes incurred but was announced in full and clearly already 2½ hours prior to departure. Later 30 Minutes were added to the delay. However, as the delays were clearly announced they just extended my lounge stay in Saigon and shortened my lounge stay in KLIA. Onboard, special meals were accommodated, FAs are professional, and service is good. Only problems is that on shorter regional flights the Airline is “dry” – even in business class. Not even beer is served. Transfer in KLIA was tight but went smooth as the departing flight was the gate next to the one arrived to. The next flight equally good and arrived on time in PNH. Special meals and three hot meals were offered. Had seat 1C with a legspace that I impossibly could use up as I could not even reach/touch the galley in front of me. My luggage was comprehensive (2 big pieces plus hand-luggage but was ready on the belt after I passed immigration. Miles credited to my Qatar FFP within a week. Could have been rated 10/10 but I deduct a bit for delay and for lack of varieties of drinks onboard. In summary: well done Malaysia Airlines – you are a rising star!"

Booked because of very good price but eventually got what I paid for. London - Kuala Lumpur - Perth was a disaster to start with. Those days Malaysia Airlines were upgrading their systems and no online check-in was available, had to queue for roughly 2hrs 55 mins at Heathrow (try and imagine a queue for a packed A380) because 2 out 4 agents couldn't care less about the situation and decided to show up just 2 hrs prior to take-off. I mean, really? You know you are going to get massive queues, put more people to work for those 2/3 days of emergency. Obviously flight was delayed, roughly 80 mins - but arrived to KUL with just a 30 mins delay. Flight itself was less than remarkable. Food bland, entertaining system not brilliant, seats just OK and I didn't like the cabin crew's attitude as they all were rather uninterested and cold although not openly rude. One male member in particular acted like he was the owner of the airplane and was doing everybody a favor to be there. Transit in KUL was rather smooth and 737 to PER left on time. One of the bags didn't make it to our destination despite the connection being quite comfortable and received that with the following flight - lucky I had insurance to cover the emergency expenses. MEL-KUL on A330. No delays, same comments as above about food/cabin crew etc real problem for this flight was the state of the toilets. 3/4 hours into the flight they were filthy, smelly and just disgusting and no one cared to clean them. Been flying around the world and never seen something like that. KUL-LHR on A380 luckily enough I had booked preferred economy seats on the upper deck and the flight was smooth. Couldn't eat their food, I tried but it was just awful, but at least it departed on time, crew were better than what I had gotten until then and they managed not to misplace my bags. All in all a rather disappointing trip. Good if you want to save money but otherwise there are tons of better airlines out there."

This airline is probably the worst airline we have flown for few reasons. The plane itself was quite old. The crew members were rude and abrupt and could not care less about the passengers throughout the flight - an example is when we had sat in the wrong seats by pure accident, one of the flight attendants rudely exclaimed 'You are in her seat!'. She could have asked politely to check our boarding passes that we were in the correct seat or even said something like sorry but I think you may be in the wrong seats. We had no issues with changing the seats as it was an accident on our part but would have appreciated some politeness. After serving dinner and lights turned off for people to go to sleep, we did not see a single crew member for about 4-5 hours (this was an 8 hour flight). On other airlines on flights of this duration crew members walk down the aisles with glasses of water every hour or so which my family would have appreciated as we were quite thirsty. Toilets did not seem to be cleaned throughout the flight and were in a terrible state a couple of hours before landing. Headphones were taken off passengers 45 minutes before landing so in-flight entertainment could not be used which is an issue particularly when travelling with kids.

After 1 and a half hours we spoke to the SriLankan Air lines luggage services and upon inquiring after 1 1/2 hours they are saying the luggage has not arrived. Over 50 passengers were waiting for their luggage and never one of them approached us to say the luggage has not arrived until we asked. According to them, the KL airport also has not given them any information regarding non loading of luggage. None of the staff was available and even when we complained to Malaysian staff the following day, he was not available at work and told us to call the Airport Luggage services and he was saying he cannot guarantee anything whether the luggage is even found or not. It was utter madness. And he failed to answer our phone when we called afterwards. And to top it all, we were promised that the luggage will be delivered to our home, yet on the second day, they call us and ask us to collect the luggage ourself as they have lost the photocopy of our Passport Copies.

The plane looks old and worn out even though it was a new 737. The business class seats had little legroom and the biggest downside was the tray table which was basically placed on the side of the seat and when unfolded was very close to the body - I could not push it further even if I wanted to. The width of the seat seems OK, but I keep touching the other passenger's elbow which shows that the arm rests seem to be too narrow. The food was pretty OK though on this route they did not serve alcohol. There are limited recline on the seats and - just like the economy seat - the screen is attached to the back of the seat in front of me. Thus, when the other seat reclines, we have to adjust the screen accordingly. I thought the business seats were not that special, and maybe sticking in economy is not a bad idea."

The plus side, the seat pitch and width are above standard. Service from crew member not impressive though. Although flying domestic, cabin crew service should be consistent. When come to food, the quality is very disappointing. I opt for the seafood pasta. It was too oily to consume or inedible. No wonder other national airlines and International airlines already catching up and overtaking Malaysia Airlines. I really hope the new Domestic Business Class seat will roll out soon."

Very happy with their courteous service, on time departure, and delicious food. Porsche design toiletry bag handed out, slippers and noise cancelling headphone, all made for a great overnight flight experience. I was impressed by the service and attitude of the crew, very welcoming and proactive. Throughout the night the temperature of the cabin was just right, each seat had lush pillow and duvet, ""Bed"" cover as well to add extra comfort. One little complain would be the tight space one has to squeeze into the laid flat. Since it wasn't a full flight, I asked for extra pillow and blanket as padding to facilitate sleeping on the side, and that made for a more comfortable experience. Next sector was also on the same air craft at the same seat. Once again, wonderful breakfast service and comfortable seat. It was a great experience, and wish them well for making it back on the top amongst all the other quality airlines in the region."

They use their new business cabin on the A330 which includes a flat bed seat with seats on the left side of the cabin being single. Middle and right side seats are in pairs so you could be sitting with somebody else. There is no amenity pack on this service. A blanket and pillow are provided. This was a night service (23.30 departure) and possibly the worst I have ever had in a J class cabin. The flight was about 6hrs and 30mins. Just as you fall asleep during the takeoff, the lights are cranked on full for a forced refreshment service. Once that was over it took time to settle back down again and the constant seat belt on and off actions with associated announcements were very disturbing. Once I managed to sleep again, I was abruptly woken up some 2hrs 45mins before landing for a breakfast service with full lights in the cabin and crew calling for passengers who want to eat which almost nobody took. Then everyone sat bored and disturbed for the remainder of the flight. This is an airline which needs to get in touch with its premium product on board. The crew are nice enough and the food and beverage is not bad but the way the cabin is managed and service delivered has a long way for improvement. Business suites have independent seat lighting so for anyone who wants to eat, there is never a need on a night flight to illuminate the entire cabin. Being forced a breakfast 2.45 before landing is just not reasonable either. The airline should consider dine on demand service or at the most wake people up about an hour before landing. I found the whole flight irritating, managed about an hour of sleep and thus i probably wouldn't take this cabin on this airline again for the same flight."

However, the flight schedules suited my short business trip to KL so I thought I'd just bite the bullet and have myself booked on the airline. Check-in in both MNL and KUL were swift through the business class lanes (I'm a OneWorld ruby member) but the J queue in MNL was ironically slower as the agent had to check in quite a number of bags for the party ahead of me. Outbound in Y was surprisingly pleasant with a decent set of inflight entertainment options, a USB port to charge my phone and tasty food options for the 3.5 hour flight. Flight attendants were robotic and not the usual hospitality seen in Asian carriers. Seat comfort, however, left much to be desired as one would find one's nose touching the screen if the passenger in front decides to recline. Fortunately, I had an empty middle seat in the 3-3 configured 737, the provided headsets were flimsy and I just used my own headphones. Inbound in J was an even more enhanced experience with very friendly FAs who addressed me by name and consistently checking on my needs. The sincerity was apparent as she knew my name even as we bumped into each other in the galley on my way to the lavatory. Seat was a standard recliner with a footrest which was pretty dated but they did provide noise cancelling headsets which are of passable quality."

Enjoyed the MAS lounge prior to boarding. Service and food once on board was very good. Only complaint was my seatbelt and buckle were caked in ice cream from previous occupant so needed to give it a thorough clean . Transit in KL was very comfortable and from previous experience expected the onward flight to be in the same terminal. Perth flight was from gate H which was a ride on the train from the lounge. Upon getting to the gate there was a long queue at security check as there was only one security gate in operation serving 2 flights. Finally when boarding aircraft realised it was a 737 which was a big disappointment as it was A330 service on previous trips and business class on 737 is not comparable to A380 or A330. Cabin crew on this flight were not of the high standard of first leg. Would definitely use MAS again but would avoid 737.

This is a route I fly often and have done so for more than 20 years. Never the class leader I have always considered Malaysia Airlines  to be a decent runner up, but on this form service standards have taken a steep dive. Two of my recent flights were cancelled at short notice, without explanation or compensation and at some inconvenience. Whilst re booking my cancelled flight the airline tried to charge me a change of flight fee. Finally on board, I was moved from my reserved seat by a charmless steward claiming a 'booking error'. The food and beverage offer has declined markedly and cabin service generally has suffered. Not sure what has changed in the last year or so at MAS but there is plenty of strong competition on this route and having been a loyal customer of MAS over the years I have finally voted with my feet.

I can't believe that there was no wine being served at all in Economy Class, and even for non-alcoholic drinks the choices were limited to either juices or carbonated drinks. Secondly, as an avid coffee drinker, the coffee served was tasteless without a single smell of coffee, it seems to me that it was not even prepared with grinned coffee bean but rather from instant coffee powder. The food that was below the standard economy meal that I was expecting, the bread was cold, the dessert which was a piece of banana cake. The flight attendant was not attentive, where she missed out in serving me the bread, and I had to request for it.

No idea what their drink choices are as you do not feel like asking the staff. The crew did not personally welcome passengers and introduce the facilities as its the norm in other carriers. They were hard working but something was missing - perhaps the personal touch. The satay service before landing can be presented more elegantly rather than taking an empty trolley in to the cabin.

All in all, I was very satisfied with the whole experience. Do consider flying their earlier flight, not the one arriving in Bali at 3:30pm, the immigration queue is painfully long, with 5 other flights all arriving at the same time.

Seated in 2A which was the same seat I had from Melbourne to KL. Offered a juice or water and a hot towel before take off. Crew were very friendly and obliging. After take-off the drinks trolley appeared and the Satay service (I asked for seconds). Unlike the Melbourne to KL sector there was a Menu which I was shown and then ordered my dinner and more white wine. There was a cheese platter of sorts offered and a dessert wine. I could not fault the staff and the food. Seating comfortable though the area with a fully reclined chair for your feet is a tad small. I really enjoyed the flight and the staff were great.

Unfortunately, after the flight commenced, I discovered that the electronic seat controls did not work and my seat (7A) could not be adjusted via the control panel. I then had to wait until the meal service was completed before two crew members attempted to adjust the seat manually. This required me to stand in the adjacent economy section where other passengers were trying to sleep. My apologies to the poor man whom I accidentally bumped when moving for crew. Eventually, the seat was adjusted to a very uncomfortable sleeping position for the rest of the flight. I was very concerned, however, that it could not be readjusted to the required position for landing in Melbourne. The crew were very apologetic and undertook to report this situation. An alternative seat could not be offered as the flight was full. Subsequently, I lodged a complaint with Malaysia Airlines, requesting compensation for my flight costs only to be now offered 5000 Enrich points instead - hardly equivalent to the $1600 that this flight cost me. I've twice requested a review of this offer and have yet to receive the courtesy of a response. I'll not be recommending this airline to anyone else."

At first, we were informed that our flight will be delayed for two hours due to adverse weather around airport. We were OK with this. However, after around 3.5 hours, there was no information about the status of the flight. The gate crew did not know what was the status of the flight, where is the plane, and where is the cabin crew. The in-duty manager was unreachable. There was neither food nor water provided during this period. Bad thing is that we had elderly and babies among the passengers. Then after 4 hours, we were told that we can board the plane. We boarded, then after 1 hour waiting in the plane (no flying yet), we were informed that the cabin crew apparently have exceeded their duty limit period, and thus they have to make decision whether they were going to find replacement, or cancel the flight. After waiting for one more hour inside the plane, we were told that the replacement crew will be fling from Singapore and we can fly at around 2 AM in the morning. Everyone were asked to step down from the plane. At least at this point they have decency to provide us flight meal. Then came 2 AM, the replacement crew apparently could not make it, so the flight have to be cancelled. Some of us get lucky to be rebooked to MH806 flying next morning, some others, well, I do not know what happened to them. No hotel room was provided, some of us trying to make up rest at the airline lounge, which is very bad. As a result, I had to stay up all night, miss important meeting in the next day, and spend the following day on sick leave."

After booking a vacation in September 2016 to Maldives, on April 6th my wife called to check our seating arrangements. The MH agent said our connecting flight to Male from Colombo was cancelled to our surprise, which meant we would have to have a 8-9 hour wait in Colombo. Knowing some friends were on this flight but book via Sri Lankan airlines, we checked with them, finding out the flight was not cancelled at all. Then we called Sri Lanka airlines and they also confirmed the flight was fine. So my wife initially called MH customer service spending 3-4 hours (3-4 calls) trying to sort out the problem. She was put on hold for hours only to be cut off. Many times they promised to call back, no call was ever returned. After her frustration, I called, similar responses, on hold for over 4 hours (4 calls), called hung up after being put on hold, promises made for returned call, etc. What was frustrating is that we told the agents clearly the flight was not cancelled, Why could they not escalate?  On the date of our flight we went to the airport hoping possibly getting on our correct flight, but when we went to Sri Lankan airlines, they said they could not book us in.  No only was our 2nd flight changed but we could not even get on the flight we booked on. After back and forth between the two airlines,  MH put us back on the flight which we booked and had never changed anyway by reissuing the ticket. After arriving in Colombo, we realized that the mistake of our 2nd flight would not be resolved, and we had to wait 8-9 hours in the Colombo airport. Now to find out that our flight back to KL from Colombo was moved 1 day.  We called long distance, only to have the same issues with the customer service staff. On hold, no answer, no return call, etc. The agents response was that they could not put us back on the same flight we booked, as the rates went up, amazing but we never changed the flight, MH did. "

Boeing 737-800 aircraft. The trip was basically faultless and on time - only tainted by these few minor things: Only 2 hours check in time in PNH is not enough, they are constantly cutting this. Used to be 3 hours, them 2½ hours and now 2 hours. 4 check-in desks are not enough, as I came way early and wasted 30 minutes to check in – in the elite queue. Boarding cards could not be provided throughout – not even at check-in desk in PNH. Internet net check in is a joke – you sit and mingle and waste time again and again to come to the Salomonic reply: ”Please finalise check-in in Airport to have your BPs provided” No alcohol on board on any classes at any time. This is a crime against flyer buffs and a completely unnecessary mean of patronizing customers. If you want a beer you have to cling to the lounges. Food mediocre, but nice with a hot meal – it was quite filling. On the positive side there are numerous pearls in the chain: Luggage checked in throughout (even without the last Boarding Pass). Lounge in PNH is a pleasure, though showing a decline during the last 1 year: they use 3rd party lounge Plaza Premium – good, airy, and spacy. Drinks limited (no champagne, no beer apart from local draught beer, etc.). Bakery has become dormant. On board: Special meals accommodated to perfection. Drink round provided but only 1 on each of 4 two-hours flight is not enough. Go to the galley and you shall receive more drinks. Coffee served was absolutely top notch – Starbuck can go home! Check in good and luggage transferred throughout. The missing BP that they could not issue in PNH was issued in 10 seconds (!) when I came to the desk in KUL. Mileage granted even for this low fare. Lounge in KUL perfect for an Emerald flyer. I stayed overnight in their premises. Staff onboard were all very friendly, energetic, and tolerated that I consumed my own drink purchased in airport – at times I buy supplies, as I know about the MH drinking (saving cost?) fear. IFE onboard is a joke: no hearing device, no screens opened, so absent in economy. Old, worn aircraft, however, the seats in are soft and spacious and table trays had been rehabilitated and were firm and good. I could stretch out my legs completely in row no. 5 (the first one after business class). They kept middle seats free (as much as possible) in the 3x3 configuration. A pleasurable journey and I will gladly take the trouble again diverting my travels through KUL – at least as long I am elite flyer in Oneworld (at Qatar) and they have these incredible bargains. Toilets were clean – it helps that they virtually prevent people from drinking by extremely limited choice of drinks using small paper mugs. However, I assume that I have become addicted to this airline in my attempts to revive it. Helped by the discounts campaigns I take the troubles extending my time. Of course my Oneworld elite status helps a lot to make my travels smooth. But having travelled on MH for years I have never missed a flight or lost a suitcase."

Being only 5:30 hours long, it is hard to choose between dine now and sleep later or the opposite. Crew were very hard working and present. I only managed a shut-eye for an hour, and stayed up most of the time. Crew offered me array of hot drinks and snacks. I was quite impressed by the service and food quality on board. The nasi lemak I chose was surprisingly authentic and delicious, considered it's made in Perth."
✅ Verified Review ,A380,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Kuala Lumpur to London,April 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,2.0,1,no,1,"  The flight from Kuala Lumpur to London had incompetent and lazy staff who were not interested in customers. They just did their bit and no more, the seats were shabby with broken IFE handset, foot locker broken. I used the book the cook. It was awful so I asked for something else only to be told there was only a pack of nuts left and no other food of any sort. There used to be a place close to the stairs (on the top deck) where you could help yourself to soft drinks, snacks and a magazine. Not now, nothing there, empty. When I fly Thai or Singapore Airlines on a long haul the staff are constantly coming round with water or a juice. Not Malaysia Airlines, not once did a member of staff walk through the business class aisle to ask or serve anyone. I fly quite a lot to South East Asia and many times with MH but this was the last time, the company has gone down hill fast. Their customer services are slow to answer emails if at all. My luggage was damaged in transit and they have admitted liability (I have email verification from their claims dept). They offered me a renumeration package which I accepted but I have yet to receive it. "

Very efficient check in at Melbourne Airport 3 hours prior to departure and informed MAS Lounge is closed for renovation and invited to use Qantas Business Class lounge. After clearing security and passport control went to the lounge which was really below the normal Qantas standard. No food on offer until an hour after I had arrived. Very little to eat though the self-service bar was open. Boarding called and a designated Business Class boarding lane. Seat 2A next to the window. Juice or water offered prior to take-off but no champagne! After take off the drinks trolley appeared and ordered a gin and tonic. On the downside there were no menus for food and drink offered but the standard satay trolley was next and they were wonderful. Following that orders were taken for lunch but still no menu. I ordered the Beef Rendang which was excellent and some ice-cream which came in plastic tub. No cheese and biscuits with a post lunch wine was offered. Movie selection was just ok but had to use the touchscreen as the remote on my seat wasn't working so had a feeling there were a lot more movies in the system but hard to get to them. Snacks were chips or biscuits and an extra ice-cream if you wanted. Prior to landing was offered a Lamb Pie which was very good and another glass of the excellent white wine. Overall a pleasant but not outstanding flight but I give full credit to the crew who were wonderful and the seat which was very comfortable. Just bring back a menu and wine list and cheese and biscuits after a nice meal!! Landed ahead of time and breezed through immigration and customs and then the KL Express into Kuala Lumpur. For the cost of the return Business Class ticket vs Singapore Airlines et al it was well worth it!

Two of the toilets were out or order, very long queues to use the one at the rear of the aircraft. Food was awful. Check in was awful. I had to ask six times for my preferred seat.

This is my second flight with Malaysia Airlines, the first was great and I was very comfortable on board. However, the service I encountered during my second flight (before I boarded the airplane) was terrible. I checked in online and received my boarding pass sent to my email. I was confused about whether this boarding pass would let me on the plane or if I needed to go to the checkin counter, but the security officer checking tickets and IDs said my ticket was okay. The immigration officer also confirmed that my ticket was okay, but pointed me to information if I had questions. After a lot of calls, information got in touch with a Malaysia Airlines representative who said they would give me a different ticket at the gate, but information said they weren't sure if the boarding pass on my phone was acceptable or not. Then I went through another security check with the boarding pass on my phone. I arrive at the gate and a kind flight attendant scans the boarding pass on my phone and I thought everything was fine. But then a male representative for Malaysia Airlines brought me the tickets and yelled at me about why I used the boarding pass on my phone and how it was possible that I got through all the security. At this point, everyone at the gate was watching and I was extremely uncomfortable. He then informed me that none of this was his fault and yelled at me more about how much I inconvenienced the staff. I made an honest mistake and I apologized to him, but I am shocked that an airline employee would yell at a passenger in such a manner. I am also disappointed that it took so long to determine whether the boarding pass on my phone was acceptable. Looking back on the email I received from the airline with my boarding deal my pass, there is conflicting and unclear information, but I also should have called the airline before to clarify. I felt extremely uncomfortable and nervous after this employee left because I was worried I would encounter him again on the plane. "

Fortunately it was a fast check in. The boarding was on time but had to wait 10 minutes to fly. Cabin staff service was good. They served a nice breakfast and asked my opinion about that. I told it was a nice warm breakfast. I could watch movie along the journey and arrived safely with nice landing. I think Malaysia Airlines was trying their best to improve their quality.

Cabin staff service was horrible. I asked the male attendant for a blanket, he forgot.  I then waved for another attendant who came out from the Business Class cabin, and asked her for a blanket.

The seats do not have power plugs. Pre takeoff drink served. I made the mistake of selecting orange juice, which was neither orange nor juice.  After takeoff, lunch was served. As it turns out, the flight had no alcohol on board. Totally dry. They don't even offer beer to accompany the lunch with. Just water or their selection of artificial fruit juices. Either it's a cost cutting measure, or the airline is beginning ever more wahabi, in deference to Malaysia's Muslim majority. Though it's hard to see how they expect to compete against the likes of Emirates, Etihad, or Qatar, flag carriers of countries 99+% Muslim, who serve alcohol to passengers understanding that not all passengers are Muslim and that not all Muslims avoid alcohol. The passengers in the business class cabin were anyway mostly of Chinese origin, so it's hard to see how this no-alcohol policy endears them to their main paying clientele. Staff seemed eager to please, but given the pathetic tools they have at hand, there wasn't much they could do. Overall a less than mediocre experience. I wouldn't recommend this carrier even at a strong discount."

Very disappointed in our most MH experience. Both flights were delayed with little information forthcoming from ground staff. We had a 9+ hour transit in KUL however our bags did not make it to DPS. Upon boarding the KUL-DPS sector, the Captain advised there was a delay in departure because of a baggage system malfunction. Upon arrival in DPS found that our bags had not been loaded on the flight. There was chaos at baggage handling as there were a significant number of bags missing. Promised the bag would arrive later that day but in fact arrived late the next morning. No answer on the Missing Luggage Office number in KL. We are frequent travellers and know that flights are delayed and that bags go missing however with MH it was exacerbated by chaos, misinformation or no information. Inflight, the business class service was as always very good. We'll think twice about using MH again - when they're good, they're very good but when things go awry everything falls apart."
✅ Verified Review ,A330,Business,Business Class,Sydney to Kuala Lumpur,August 2017,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,1.0,3,no,6,"  Sydney to Kuala Lumpur. You get what you pay for: MH has tried to pick up its game, but it has missed the mark. The new business class product on its A330s for long-haul service (like the KUL-SYD and SYD-KUL flights I just took) are a welcome improvement over the out-of-date 2-2-2 recliners on this plane before. However, the unique and strange cabin arrangement defeats the value of much of that improvement. For starters, each BC seat varies in space offered to the ticket-holder - in some cases, dramatically. For single (solo) fliers, the ""king's throne"" seats along the right side windows - only 3 of them - offer amazing privacy and storage. however, in 3 different rows (2K, 4K, and 6K). However, MH has chosen to cram in two business class seats into that same space allocated to one seat in 4 other rows. Therefore, a solo traveler stuck in the right-side window seats of XX, 5K, or 7K - will find her/himself wedged in with no direct aisle access, no privacy from the adjacent seat-holder, and almost no storage space. For a couple traveling together, the 6 pairs of center seats (D and G) offer considerably more privacy, space and storage options than the two seats on the right-side windows. Then there's the bizarre lavatory allotment. There's effectively only one lav for all 27 business class seats in the front of the plane, accessed by navigating through the galley. for some incomprehensible reason, and unlike other airlines flying the A330 with a business class, MH chose not to fill all of the space between the 1L/1R and 2L/2R doors with business class, but instead place four rows of economy inside that space, so instead of allowing the doors to form a natural barrier between business class and economy class, there's just a slim wall/curtain and then the two lavs adjacent to the  doors - which crew will insist are accessible to the business class ticket-holders -- are in effect used mainly by economy class seat-holders.  Overall, the A330 business class seat is passable, not great, it is quite narrow, not allowing for easy turning, and it barely allow for a 185cm person to get his legs feet into the cramped well. On the bright side, the shortcomings in the hardware department were made up considerably by the very professional, friendly and accommodating crew. Given the late hour of departure from SDY (2.345) the FA offered to serve any form of meal or snack at any later time. Wine choices were good and food was surprisingly tasty. The IFE, on the other hand, is limited in variety and old - they've had the same first-season of sitcoms offered for many months. only a few big new release movies. No WiFi offered. Ground staff was far less impressive, allowing passengers to start boarding and filling up the airbridge but blocked at the aircraft door by FAs not ready to receive passengers. I fly MH in business class because it often comes at a low price and I want a lie-flat bed for long-haul flights, but the time-honored adage could not be more accurate in this regard: you get what you pay for."

Despite the cost cutting, Malaysia Airlines do their best to bring a satisfactory inflight experience for passengers. A more spacious A330 aircraft has been deployed for both legs, the new ""Throne"" style business class seat offers so much space and comfortable to sleep in. Menu has been removed, instead stewardess announces to each passengers what is on offer. On routes over 3 hours, alcohol is available. Portions of meals were decent and tasty. Inflight service is fine, warm and efficient. I only had 55 minutes to transfer and I was glad I made it, so did my luggage. When Malaysia Airlines offer attractive discounts (like this time), it is really worth considering."

London to KUL on A380 upper deck. Delayed by 4 hours but kept informed. Boarded an hour before take off and was roasted in the cabin as the a/c was not on while we waited. Drinks were served to rehydrate us. Finally left at about 1am which we had a slight panic about as I presume special permission must have been sought to fly after Heathrow's closing hours - so good on them as we would've missed our Kuala Lumpur to Sydney flight. Definitely worth trying to get a seat on the upper deck as they're more spacious and also less populated. Food good, drinks were sporadically offered but not as often as I would expect (compared to previous experience). Inflight entertainment ok, although my daughter's wasn't working but there was a spare seat. Service was fairly middling. Kuala Lumpur to Sydney on A330. Seating more cramped than previous flight, more atypical of an Economy Class seat. Entertainment ok, although one of our seats could only operate this facility using touch screen as console wasn't working. Drinks constantly offered. Food was one main meal which was great and one snack (chicken pasty) which was fairly inedible. For an 8 hour flight, perhaps the snack should be better. Full flight but crew worked hard to keep everyone happy. Departed and arrived on time. Sydney to Kuala Lumpur on A330. My mother who needed wheelchair assistance and this service was very good with the ground staff ensuring we had really good seats. If possible, try to get seats in Rows 9, 10 or 11 as they have very good legroom. Fairly empty flight and the crew were fantastic - probably the best I've encountered in Economy. They really couldn't do enough. Main meal good, the snack was a pizza which was much more edible than the pasty on the outbound flight. Departed and arrived on time. KL - London on A380. Again managed a seat on the Upper Deck - really can't recommend enough that you try to source these seats. One of the attendants on our Sydney to Kuala Lumpur leg the week before was on this flight and I knew we were going to be in good hands. Once again, fantastic service with constant drinks being served. Food again was good.

Lets get the bad bit out of the way, the flight was delayed by about an hour and the plane became unbearable hot, APU failure and Heathrow not able to cater for a hot day unlike other airports. After start up all was good though, Captain continued to keep us in the picture with the issue and apologising. On boarding not a problem, well organised and for such a plane pretty quick. Crew were immediately attentive and helpful and this carried on throughout the flight, nice to see the purser about all the time instead of being huddled in their little cubby hole. IFE acceptable, films I could watch, American TV channels are dire, MA can we have some good TV out of the UK. The only nuisance was the lag when asking it to do something. Drinks were offered all the time and were readily available, pre\with and after dinner and during the flight. Both meals I would gladly have paid for, it was better than our national airlines Business class, just not plated up. Seat was very acceptable and think it is one of the best out there for economy. All in all a good flight, well done Malaysia Airlines."

The IFE was very slow to respond and the annoying ads before each show whether movie or TV show was annoying. The movies were either old or mostly detective / murder / action / sci fi. We got peanuts and a choice of juice soon after take off. Food was served about an hour or so into the flight, choice of chicken curry or basil fish. We were in row 24, four up from the toilets which reeked. Quiet flight though, no screaming kids. A pizza thing was served before landing, congealed and barely lukewarm, inedible. There were no landing cards to be filled in before arrival. It's all biometric. First time I've experienced that. Returning started poorly, in the holding pen at KLIA, I needed the toilet. The gate agent said he'd hold my boarding pass and I'd collect it from him on my return. Long wait in line up but finally got back to him and he had lost it, said he gave it to a friend at the desk who had left. Made me sit by the door till all passengers had gone through and boarded. Was getting worried by now. I did know my seat number though. Eventually he sat at a computer and gave me a print out. The plane was newer than the one we flew up in and the IFE more responsive. Still annoying ads. The brunch was minimal in size, a quiche and two cakes. Before landing we got given a pastry thing. We landed an hour earlier than scheduled. Would I fly with them again?

Check-in at Melbourne airport was tedious as the queues were long and no attempt to manage the queue lines. It was a full flight as it was Australian school holidays. They gave an incorrect gate number which they 'rectified' later. The boarding area was congested at Gate 7 and little attempt was made by ground staff to organize the seating and boarding. They did request parents with children and strollers to come forward but allowed eager passengers to block the boarding area. Again, no boarding by zones which is odd considering this was a full flight. Malaysia Airlines doesn't seem to like controlling the boarding process both at KLIA or elsewhere. The flight itself was uneventful. The FAs were polite and efficient but did not bother to interact with the passengers or exude any warmth or interest in their passengers. In contrast to the Qantas flight I took a few days ago, the warmth of the FAs was like chalk and cheese. The main meal was okay but the snack served before landing was tasty. They called it a pizza but it was really a pie. The FAs did keep everybody well watered and answered calls promptly. The IFE was okay, not a great selection but okay for an 8 hour flight. Baggage arrived really late but that is not the fault of MH but rather the poor service of KLIA. Even the baggage belt was not updated with flight arrivals and pax were walking around enquiring asking staff for help."

Both flights on time. Good lounge in SGN (Apricot) and even better in KLIA where I was let into the First Class Lounge (Oneworld Emerald status). Food onboard was good, at least 2 options of hot meals despite short flights of approx. 2 hours. My special meals ordered (seafood) was honoured – except for the 1st flight where I forsaked it purposely at check-in as they obviously could not handle it with very short notice. I was given the best economy seats available, even without requesting for it. FAs were all top notch, alert, and kind to all passengers. They instantly recognised me as high level tier card-holder and got lots of attention, despite travelling on a shameless cheap economy ticket, paying 166 USD for a return ticket of 4 legs. No alcohol onboard, but the lounges they provide have plenty. In KUL they have champagne as well as sparkling Pinot Noir wine from Australia. Noisy, old aircraft, but well maintained. Generous luggage allowance starting with 30 kg in economy plus whatever can be added for elite card holders. Good IFE with personal monitors. MH is upping the game.

The check-in went smoothly then the flights left more-or-less on-time. The cabin crew were attentive and professional and the food they served was pretty decent in the context of economy class. My only criticisms here were the fact short-haul flights are dry even in Business class and also the fact that the only snacks on the galley on the Kuala Lumpur to London route were packets of salted peanuts. At the same time Malaysia Airlines was generous with free drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) on the flight to London and for me and many other passengers this is very important. The A380 and 737 were both comfortable. My only criticism was the fact my key pad for controlling entertainment, my reading light and the call button was broken meaning I had to stand up to press the call button or use the touch screen to control my entertainment. Overall my experience was a positive one and I will not hesitate to book flights with Malaysia Airlines in the future.

An announcement was made for passengers needing assistance and people traveling with young children but everyone ignored the announcement and rushed forward and the gate staff did nothing about it. Malaysia Airlines needs to get their act together re boarding as this is not the first time this has happened. Once on board, the inflight service was good. FA's were efficient and helpful but it was clear that they were woefully understaffed in economy. The flight was delayed by one hour and there was an apology from the flight deck. The food service took ages as only one FA was distributing meals on each aisle. There was turbulence regularly throughout the flight and clear announcements were made to this effect. However, the FA's were reluctant to serve hot beverages once the seat belt sign was off. Despite this, many people were asking for tea and coffee so eventually it came out but it was lukewarm. The meal was very tasty but the portion size has shrunk considerably. The cabin was scruffy and the toilets could have been cleaner. Overall, there is room for improvements in food portion size, more FA's needed on board and boarding at KLIA needs to be looked at."

We were delayed in Perth with flight MH126 which was scheduled to leave Perth at 0200 but didn't leave until 1330 on 23 May 2017. We spoke to someone at the airport, (after looking for someone, no one came to the gate to advise what was happening) on evening of 22 May 2017 and was advised that we had been put on alternative flights and that we could either stay in a hotel or go home and be reimbursed taxi fares to and from. We were advised to claim the taxi fares we could submit our receipts online, but I can't see where to do this on their website. When we arrived at the airport to check in my husband and I were seated separately, so we requested to be sat together and boarding passes were reissued. We asked if it was possible for an upgrade and were advised there was only one seat left. When we went into the the Qantas gold club lounge we were advised we couldn't enter due to staff not transferring our frequent flyer numbers to the new reservation and boarding passes even though we gave the lady at check in our frequent flyer numbers again. When we boarded the plane we were seated three rows from the back with hardly anyone else on the flight, my husband is a Sapphire oneworld member, where is the priority in relation to the seating. We spoke to the steward on the plane and were advised that there were 5 business class seats free. Through this whole ordeal there has not been adequate information flowing through. What we would like is to be reimbursed the taxi fares and meal at the airport. Since the above original email on 23/5/17 I haven't heard from anyone in customer service, even though I have emailed 7 times now. I have messaged through facebook and was advised to send in a complaint. I have done this three times now. I have sent in the receipts for reimbursement as advised and still nothing. How does one outside Malaysia get in contact? Also due to the original inadequacies I now have to claim my missing points. I think Malaysia Airlines should reevaluate their third party lounge at Manila airport absolute disgrace, ended up using Japan Airlines lounge. Never again will I use this airline, even at the loss of the points which was one of the only reasons we used this airline. "
✅ Verified Review ,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok Suvarnabhumi,June 2017,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4,yes,8,"  Malaysia Airlines have been under restructuring recently and I can feel that things are starting to get back in order. My flight to Bangkok departed with only half the plane filled and was delayed slightly due to aircraft arriving late from the leg before. However, the service and professionalism on board is second to none and I must thank the cabin crew for delivering an impeccable service and the pilots for a safe and smooth landing after a go around due to bad weather when arriving in Bangkok. The meals on board were edible if not somewhat salty on the departing leg (I ordered a biryani chicken) but drinks option have been severely limited compared to the last time I travelled with MH. IFE choice selection was ok but the hardware looks worse for wear due to unresponsive screen and faulty joystick and usb port. The aircraft cleanliness overall was acceptable except for dirty windows and a few tray tables. The return leg was uneventful as the aircraft departed on time and arrived early. However, Malaysia Airlines should seriously be more consistent in its product and not schedule a 737 without IFE and BSI on international flights. I lost count how many times I'm on board 9M-FFF for the returning leg from SIN, PEN (X2), LGK and BKK (X2). Maybe I'm destined with this particular 738 but I don't know why they should continue leasing the oldest 738 of the fleet that has a product that differs from the majority of the 738 fleet."

Cabin crew and ground staff were helpful and certainly have no problems with any service here. While it might seem picky I do have to point out the food was really not that impressive and some of the breakfast options served seemed very unpalatable, on a long haul flight which is stressful and not particularly comfortable at best I would have expected Malaysia Airlines to put in a little more effort to put travelers at ease and feel like they are getting value for money.

I was credited Enrich points for the outward-bound trip but not for the return trip. When I noticed I sent three emails to Enrich and phoned them twice to ask for the miles, and I did this within the six month expiry period. Nothing. No reply, no acknowledgement, nothing. I find this particularly irritating because I fly a lot with Malaysia. Then I looked back through the comments posted here. There is a common thread – frontline staff try hard and customer service is good (despite the food being mediocre) - but head office is rubbish. It’s ridiculous that MH has gone to such lengths to rehabilitate itself after some unfortunate incidents. That its front-line staff, in the airport and on the plane, try hard to provide good service, only to be undermined by the staff in HQ. It also seems like a stupid business practice as budget airlines move so aggressively into Malaysia’s territory – that we passengers dump Malaysia because a few staff at HQ need training in customer service."

Orders taken for main course but not for starters, To be informed they do not have my choice very strange but not the end of the world! However other rows asked after me were offered all meals despite me being told they had run out? Then when the meals come out and ask what starter, again told they had run out - but the 2 other rows after me were offered all choices? It might be a coincidence but the rows after me were both Malaysians and maybe travelling as staff or family of staff as throughout the flight they were constantly getting meals and drinks without having to ask!

Normally Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur is served by the Boeing 737-800 but for Saturday's flight, the A330 was used presumably because of high passenger load. I had one of the 3 throne seats in the business class cabin - window seats on the starboard side of the aircraft with broad armrests on both sides. Service by the friendly flight attendants was efficient and warm in typical Malaysian hospitality style. Drink service included champagne. There was a choice of 3 main courses for lunch and I had the lamb stew which was good. Being a short flight, they did not serve their signature Malaysian satay. The IFE had a decent selection of the latest movies and music but since it was a short 2.5 hour flight I decided to have a short nap after lunch. Even though the space under the seat in front looked narrow, the seat was fully reclining and comfortable even for me at 178 cm tall. It would definitely be good for a long haul flight."

There are several positive sides, such as there was always a hot meal on every flight, the entertainment system was working on 3 out of 4 flights, good enough. However there are a lot of negative sides such as the impoliteness of the FA was shocking, the poor selection of drinks (no wine at all), the dirtiness of the plane as it looks it has never been cleaned and the persistent delays ( 3 out of 4 flights were delayed).

The issue is the head office. We've flown several times Australia-Europe. Never a hassle. Early 2016 we booked our flights. Sep 2016 the agent emails us with an unintelligible email which we gathered said 2 of the 4 legs were cancelled. The agent wouldn't help us. We contacted Malaysia direct who seemed quite keen for us to cancel our entire flights. Then tried to book us alternatives requiring an 8 hour KL stopover which we refused. They eventually gave us flights leaving in the early hours of the morning from Perth. We grudgingly accepted them as we had dependent arrangements in London. We looked up the replacement flights at the time on the booking website and they were cheaper than the daytime flights we'd originally booked by approx A$150 per person (x4). We contacted their head office who gave us an email address to use to ask for refunds of the difference. They have never replied to us prior to the flight. After we returned I followed them up again and they replied quickly saying that because we'd already completed the flights we couldn't get a refund. When I pointed out that they'd ignored my refund request before we flew they came back and just reiterated that it was too late. Totally unreasonable behaviour in my book. I also wrote to their CEO who also ignored me. The whole saga was a stressful hassle and we have never been listened to. We categorically will never use Malaysia Airlines again, their head office couldn't care less about customer satisfaction."

I am able to save my boarding pass on my iPhone Wallet app which makes it easier. However at the check-in counter Malaysia Airlines will still print a hardcopy of boarding pass for you. The ground staff lacks control when the passengers are boarding the plane. Passengers board altogether instead of according to seat allocations, passengers with special assistance, families with infants and children, business class, Enrich gold and silver members etc. This has not changed since the last time I flew with Malaysia Airlines in February 2017. Peanuts and drinks including alcoholic beverage served as soon aircraft is airborne. For dinner there was a choice of chicken with wedges or fish with rice. Dinner also comes with dinner roll, coleslaw and tiramisu. Generous portion and deliciously cooked, fish is beautifully prepared. Overall Malaysia Airlines is slowly gaining my trust after years of mismanagement of the airline. If they continue to improve their services and offer competitive price, I don't see why I will not choose to fly with Malaysia Airlines."

Although the incoming flight from Kuala Lumpur is late, the cabin crew worked quickly to reduce the delay time which is greatly appreciated. Boarding was quick and easy. Plenty of legroom for seat at 9C which makes the journey more comfortable for taller passengers. Seats were comfortable. I had the Nasi Lemak and I was excited when the cabin crew mentioned nasi lemak is an option for breakfast. Well cooked and even at 10,000 feet up in the air, it still tastes authentic and delicious. Breakfast also comes with croissant, yoghurt, muesli bar and fruits, orange juice and choice of coffee or tea. What is weird though is that breakfast is served at 3am when the flight is scheduled to arrive in Kuala Lumpur at 8am. I would prefer to have breakfast served around 5 or 6 am in the morning. Inflight entertainment - Going Places magazine is easy to read and lots of interesting articles. However it maybe a little too thin for longer journeys such as KUL-SYD or KUL-LHR.

Most annoying of all was though lights were dimmed in the economy cabin 2 hours into the flight (night flight), they blazed in business class until 10 minutes before decent when someone thought maybe they should be dimmed. Really appalling. Why bother after 5 hours of a 5.5 hour flight. New Delhi to Kuala Lumpur, 1 May 17, MH191 was a delight. Cabin Manager who really put the effort in. Knew your requirements before you had thought of them yourself. Had the service completed and lights dimmed within 2 hours, even with heavy turbulence. Chatty and genuine.

I have been a long standing passenger with Malaysia Airlines for well over a couple of decades. Through this time, the airline has had several ups and downs which were also experienced by passengers such as myself. Nevertheless, I have continued to fly with the airline probably because of habit, even though I have had reasons to complain on numerous occasions. I have now decided to put pen to paper here because of a recent complaint I submitted but did not even get an acknowledgement including to a follow-up mail. The issue I have now is that the airline's Enrich Loyalty Scheme is not a loyalty scheme at all from my experiences. For example, a few months ago, I had an accumulation of about 160,000 points. My flights were for the end of January 2017 and early February. The ticket was booked and paid for in early December. I requested to use my points for upgrade from economy to business, but was told I had to be on the wait-list and there was one other person ahead of me. I followed up on numerous occasions and on each occasion was informed that I was till on the wait-list. While still on the wait-list I had well over 20,000 points which expired at the end of December. I remained on wait-list till the time of my check-in for my flight in early February, when I was informed there is an upgrade seat to business available. I accepted the offer. However, what is the point of being upgraded with my points at the last moment. It did not enable me to utilise the benefits such as baggage allowance, etc. This is an example of why the airline Enrich loyalty scheme is not a loyalty scheme for loyal customers.

Very slow progress through immigration as very few desks open and no apparent effort made to open more despite efforts of one official to speed proceedings up. Chaos at 'limousine' desk-one individual working extremely hard however to get large numbers of people on buses and to hotels. Finally boarded minibus at approx 04.00am for 40 minutes drive to a very nice hotel on outskirts of KL. Got to room by 05.00am, had to be back in hotel reception by 09.00am for bus back to airport Overall very poor treatment of economy class of this A380. Once on the plane however, the flight itself was good - the cabin crew worked very hard to provide good levels of service (despite large numbers of justifiably tired and emotional passengers), the food was mostly good, and there was a comfortable seat and lots of leg room which is the main reason I have chosen this airline for London/KL/Sydney flights over the past 8 years. However this represented an extreme deterioration in the level of service expected from them - I have had better levels of service and communication from budget airlines. I was also unfortunate enough to experience a shorter delay, also for 'technical reasons' on the outbound flight from London 2 weeks previously, but that was managed well despite missing my connection to Sydney. After this experience, unlikely I will fly with them again, which is a shame as they have always provided value for money and a comfortable flight experience."

I don't usually write review but I felt this airlines deserve it.  Booked flight to Japan via Kuala Lumpur. In Heathrow London it was a mess in check in, 3 hours and 20 min in check in line. I checked in online and got seats together. At boarding noted that the seats on the boarding pass issued at airport are different! I spoke to the staff and they showed no interest in doing anything. Very bad attitude towards customer. I have the airline the benefit of doubt for the computer error, however on my return journey I'm having same issues, slow check in and wrong seats again. If you are a family or couples I advise not to fly with with Malaysian Airlines. Looking around me this seems to be a common problem. "

Without doubt the worst airline I've flown - both long haul and short haul. An incredible level of incompetence in the digital age. On the outbound flight, we called Malaysia Airlines and pre-booked exit seats several weeks in advance (all ok). Turned up to Heathrow and the Malaysia Airlines computer system had lost all pre-booked and checked-in seats, sending the check-in queue into turmoil. I appreciate things happen, but Malaysia Airlines staff did nothing to help. No one came out to speak to passengers and say there was an issue. Families were all split up and those who hadn't checked in, were given the seats of those who'd done it weeks before. We spent 2.5 hours in the check in queue and the attendant was frustrated the customers were frustrated. Delayed 45 mins on outbound. No apology at all. - The A380 is 10 years old. Malaysia Airlines have made the interior look like it was 30 years old. Was dripped on by the aircon unit the whole flight to KL. Delayed 1.5 hours on return leg (managed to split up whole families and assign exit seats to 3 year old children and have new born babies travelling alone). Again no apology. Both legs people had seats back, blind and tables down and for take off and landing and no one checked seats belts. Staff aren't rude, they just don't care. On the return journey the staff spent 2 hours in one hit laughing and joking in one of the galley areas. Worst plane food, bar none. -Entertainment system kept breaking on the way back. Again, staff weren't even offering an apology and showed not interest in finding a solution (ideal for a 13 hour flight)."

The ordeal with Malaysia Airlines started at Mumbai as the flight was delayed by 3.5 hours. It was fine as I got a message that flight is delayed and accordingly I planned my arrival at airport. The issue of my boarding pass took about 30 minutes as the I was checking in after the actual scheduled departure and they had closed the desks in the terminal. Why this was not re-scheduled is still a mystery. As I was worried about the connecting flight, I was assured by the staff that I shall get a connecting flight 3 hours later. The flight is 5 hours and the Business class seats are just a little better than economy as far as leg room is concerned. So in my cramped space I was sitting all the way five hours and dozing off as it was past midnight with no sleep. The crew never served breakfast. That was surprising and there were no amenities like toothbrush, etc. The second part was even more interesting. On reaching the transit counter, I was told that 2:00 flight is full and change is not possible. So I was offered a flight 5.5 hours later. Which again was delayed by almost an hour. The lounge is just functional and does not allow you to rest as their are no reclining seats. I was wondering why a transit hotel was not provided. I did not expect a better business class seat in short leg of 2 hours from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. On board as I had booked special AVML meal I was told that no such booking exist. They had not transferred my preference in changed flight. So I remained hungry all the way. So over all I remained seated for 15 hours through the night and almost a full day with small snacks in lounge as I have special meal requirement. On landing my baggage was missing so I wasted half hour waiting on belt and then half hour to register the missing baggage. It was delivered next morning at the hotel which was some relief."

Easy check in and nice lounge at Heathrow. Flight a bit late. Seats much more comfortable in A380 then I had read - full flat bed, a bit hard but easy to sleep and loads of room. Thin mattress and good duvet provided. Excellent food other then vegetarian option which was vegan and uninspired - chick peas served for both meals on way out and paneer the same on the way back. But very good flights. KL lounge is still very dated and worn out. A330 has slightly odd seat layout the single seats are great, the doubles ok unless you're in the window as there's little space and you need to be on good terms with your neighbour to get out. Neither food nor bed with thin blanket only nor service as good on Perth legs. Ground staff at Perth were poor, slow check in, lots of people seemingly doing nothing. No better at boarding. All four flights were near enough full. Seems the heavy discounting is at least having that positive effect. My fares were something of a bargain."

Probably, the crowd wasn't too bad. Flight was not bad for a 737 in term of the seat space, quite well-maintained. Equipped with entertainment on board for each passenger. Lots of choices of movies. Was served with a choice of either Chicken Murtabak and Fish rice. I must say Malaysia Airlines has improved a lot on their food. Delicious meal. Air hostess was polite and attentive. Toilet was clean. We arrived Bali on time. Announcement could have been better as the sound system was too soft. Overall, the flight was above my expectations. "

Check-in was relatively smooth given the long queue. Boarding was a little unusual though, with window seat passengers called first for boarding ahead of other Economy passengers.  Legroom was a little tight during the flight, especially when the passenger reclined his seat and it made the personal space feel rather claustrophobic. This also made it hard to eat when the meals were served as the steward didn't even seem to care that the passengers in front had their seats down. Meal service was quick and efficient but the quality was ordinary. The steward seemed rather lazy during the drink service and was more interested in not serving the drinks.  PTV was working although the USB port on my seat and the seat next to me was not working. Experience worse when trying to put the seat upright for landing. The seat adjustment button got stuck and although the seat came back up, it would not lock in position. Had to sit for landing without putting pressure on the seat back. Overall, the aircraft was poorly maintained and crew not very hospitable nor caring. "

Overall not a bad flight, seat reasonably comfortable in both sitting and lying position. Aircraft itself is starting to look a bit shabby with plastic panels hanging off. Crew were ok but found it a bit bizarre on a morning departure from London that the lights were dimmed straight after food service. Biggest issue was lack of alcohol onboard, after 2 gin and tonics I was told they had run out and we were only 3 hours in to a 12 hour flight. I asked for a baileys instead and was told that was the last one. Totally unacceptable to pay a business class fare and not to be able to get preferred choice of drink for 9 hours of the flight.

There are 2 crews for 8-10 rows in the cabin. They were very active and quick response to any request. Foods tasted really good. There always fish and chicken. (Neither beef nor pork) Food warm and fresh. Crew also repeat to serve an extra beverages for several times. They are also polite and smiles. For this long-haul flight from KUL to LHR (13 hrs), I can sleep, sit and stretch my legs comfortably. It's the best experience for the economy long-haul flight."

I was looking forward to my trip in Malaysia Airlines as they enjoyed flying with them before, but this flight was one of the worst I have taken. The check in and lounge in London were great and I had a nice seat (although hard and uncomfortable when flat) Once we were airborn a faulty door seal resulted in an alarm sounding for over 3 hours. The crew carried on with the service despite there clearly being a fault. We circled over Amsterdam for about an hour while he captain tried to fix it. However no reassurances to the passengers or apologies or explanation of why we were circuling during the time the fault was evident. I travel frequently but this engendered severe anxiety and I've never wanted a flight to end sooner. The CSD was pleasant enough once he saw my and others passengers anxiety but the crew were really set on dishing out the alcohol and satay. There were other faults on the plane - lavatory lights not working in business class and seats and bowls filthy and scratched. Indifferent crew too. Some delightful others really rude. The safety of the aircraft was my main concern and the lack information made the situation worrying. I will not fly them again."

If you choose to fly on this late night (22:50) flight, be advised that it regularly leaves early, because it has very light loads. We were airborne at 22:30. There was just the two of us in Business, and about ten people in economy. Needless to say we arrived at KL early, with ampler time to make our connection to Doha and London on Qatar Airways. Much to our delight, we and our bags were checked through all the way to London, even though we had separate PNRs/tickets. This was a great touch from Malaysia Airlines, avoided by other One World carriers, except Qatar Airways. Cabin service was fine, though we declined the meal service because of the late hour. A choice of main courses was available though. Seat and space were good. But once again I was left wanting a glass of alcohol, which is not served on short flights."

In total we flew 4 times with Malaysia Airlines over 2 weeks. I have to say that the flights: London to KL and KL to London, were half empty so the flight attendants and airport staff were quite relaxed and attentive. Luckily we did not queue for long at check in on both flights. At Heathrow the lady at check in was lovely, chatty and proactive. She advised us to be seated on the lower deck as she could find two seats on a row by ourselves. Boarding was easy and the flight took off on time. Same experience for our flight from KL to London. Everything was quick and easy. We used the Malaysia lounges on several occasions and they were all good (Heathrow one is the best though). The inflight services were good, the flight attendants offered water several times. Seats in economy are ok. Entertainment a bit old but still plenty of choice. One thing not good, toilets. It is not the fault of the flight attendants. The toilets need a good good cleaning from the contractors at the airport. They smell terribly and are uninviting. I cannot imagine the state of the toilets when the flight is full! The food served on board is ok, I have flown with other companies and frankly the food served on flights in economy are just average. The flight attendants were nice and polite, they followed up on our requests and served drinks several time during the duration of the flight. If you are kind and polite they are polite and helpful in response. One other thing that was poor about the Malaysia Airlines experience is their website. From my personal experience other airlines have a much better website. I booked via a travel agency so we got a very good deal, If I had to pay full price I might not have booked the holiday. We are also very thankful as we were upgraded to business on our flights KL Bali and return.

On my return flight from London, we had to wait for almost 2 hours standing in queue just for boarding pass to be issued. We are then served by unprofessional customer service counter staff.  Standing in the queue for 2 hours and with an elderly, makes everyone restless and tired especially its morning flight. We were told system are down and we will be allocated seats that we have chosen during online check-in. I make a request to just have my elderly mother to be seated beside my sister. It was turned down by him given the same reason as system are done.  Hence, we are seated separately. However, during queuing to board the plane I overheard a customer service lady staff telling a lady infront of us that she can only get her seats to be seated together with her partner if they have paid the additional cost for the seat tickets during booking.  I ask for it while its my turn but she told me a different story and it can't be done as the system are down. I was disappointed and proceed on as the given seats. The last draw that makes me write this review was that I found out that the whole row seats in front of me are taken up by a family of 6 or 7, which continued to the same row in the middIe seating.  I paid more to book an aisle seats, and my allocated are window seats. I will not be recommending Malaysia Airlines even if the tickets are cheap. Delayed flights in both London and KUL, back to SIN.

I got this flight using MHupgrade - bidding to upgrade from Economy to Business. Check-in was quick and easy. The Golden Lounge in Melbourne Airport was old, one could possibly use the Qantas Business lounge due to One World alliance reciprocal privileges. There was only one entry to the aircraft so boarding passengers were slower. Upon boarding, pre-flight drinks were promptly served. After take-off, the satay was served and I maintain that this is one of the best satay I've ever experienced. My main meal was the Cod and Salmon duo - seared fillets of salmon and cod, accompanied with wasabi-infused mashed potato, baby carrots and lobster sauce. This was a pre-selected meal using Chef-on-Call service. I was satisfied and I didn't have dessert by choice. Inflight entertainment was good enough to keep me entertained. The seats transforms into a flat bed which is comfortable enough for a nap. The touch sensitive control panels for the seat is situated in an awkward location where my elbows will inadvertently make contact with them and unexpectedly move my seat. Storage space varies from seat to seat due to the asymmetrical arrangement of the seats. I was seated on aisle seat 2E. Cabin crew were attentive, professional and efficient. Upon arrival in KL international airport, the customs and immigration queue for Business Class passengers were so long because there was only one dedicated counter open at the time. All in all, I am happy with my flight, but there are certain things that can be improved, particularly the speed of boarding and clearing customs / immigration."

I was travelling with my partner and after confirming that we were seated next to each other in a 2-4-2 configuration It was a surprise to find the check in agent had moved us into completely different rows and seats. After receiving the boarding passes we raised this with the agent. He then informed us that there were no two seats next to each other available. After showing him the MAS seat selection confirmation he quickly changed his tone and put us in our original seats. This was truly puzzling. The flight was mediocre. IFE minimal and meals sub-par.

Flight crew were rude and no interest in customer service and throughout the flight made it look as though they were simply forced to work. Food was inedible. Cabin looked tired and dirty. Toilets were no better. Overall the service on this domestic sector was not commendable at all. MH seriously needs to improve on the basic customer services skills if they ever want to be on top again. "

No greeting and just looking at his PC. While boarding, I was greeted by a senior steward by surname. I like the 42-inch seat pitch which gives a lot of space to stretch my legs. A hot towel, pillow and blanket were offered before departure. Enjoyed the meal but with limited choice due to late night flight. Overall, I quite enjoyed MAS business class.

Reasonable IFE selection, and food (chicken and cheesy-mash) tasty. The otherwise excellent A380 cabin was let down by the poor state of maintenance of the toilets - overdue for repair and a deep-clean! The full Boeing 737-800 hop up to Bangkok was very cramped, the box-food meal very basic, not something one would wish to repeat too often."

Everyone seemed to rush into the queue when boarding. Seated in a special side of the cabin, although it is only economy class there are only two rows in that cabin which I like, a little personal space and more privacy. Cabin crew were polite and friendly. They offer a choice of chicken and fish for dinner. I picked the fish which was boneless, well cooked and delicious. Malaysia Airlines were generous with drinks although they could have water on the tray. They do serve alcohol on this sector. Plenty of choices for the inflight entertainment and good content in the inflight magazine, Going Places. Overall very impressed with the improvement Malaysia Airlines has made. Looking forward to the next trip with them.

Inflight entertainment has a wide variety to keep me entertained on a five-hour flight. New fresh look for Malaysia Airlines inflight magazine, Going Places as well. Although it is a little thinner than usual I love the new look. Food is delicious and quite a good portion for economy class. I had the omelette with spinach and baked potatoes for breakfast and they did not disappoint. No WiFi available on board. This flight has changed my perspective towards Malaysia Airlines (and it's for the good!). Already thinking maybe I should try flying from Perth to London with Malaysia Airlines in the near future."

Despite not serving alcohol on board for short and medium range flights there is plenty of it in the lounges they use. FA's onboard excellent. Small aircraft a bit noisy, aged, but well maintained. Out of 16 seats in business class, the load was low, 4 and 6 passengers respectively. In economy class, 2 of 3 seats were empty. True, classic, soft bolstered business class chairs (I love them!). No real IFE nor WiFi. Three choices of hot meal offered and they appeared not to ran out of any. Food fairly good, though had one dish which came out disappointing: a lamb cutlet turned out to be lamb stew in a sugary sauce, the staff tried to change it to another, but the same issue. Need to check the providers. No smoothies, no cheese, no ice cream, no chocolate, no amenities, no pens, no kid toys, no inflight sales. Earplug on demand. Earphones of very low quality. Wet towels and pre-departure soft drinks offered. FA in good mood, proactive, and very knowledgeable. The trip is definitely to 7 and we add one due to an incredibly competitive price of ticket.

Malaysia Airlines is competent getting you from A to B, but they provide a much lower level of service than low cost carriers such as AirAsia. They moved our original flight time by a significant amount (from 0930 to 1945) (booked 9 months prior), causing our entire end-of-trip travel plans to be disrupted. We requested a refund for that flight as their services were no longer useful, and they denied the request on the grounds it was a multi-trip booking - a first indicator for poor service. It then took 4 separate phone calls to arrange a change in booking - the third time was only successful as we demanded to speak to a manager. The other major issue we have with the airline is that they served peanuts to every customer on the flight. This is one of the most common allergens, and of course it is also finger food. The result is that all of the seats and touch screens are covered in peanut allergen - ultimately causing my wife to have severe rashes over her body after all 4 of our flights with them in the past trip. We will not fly with them again, as they are more expensive than low cost airlines, but with a lower level of service."

While the cabin crew were friendly and polite, and assisted with your needs, there were downfalls. I think Malaysia Airlines need to improve food. All the meals were quite tasteless. After a few bites it was hard to finish it at all. Placement was messy. I had an 'egg breakfast', and the eggs did not even taste remotely like an egg. It was plain, dry, and in need of a sauce of some kind. Drinks was overall pretty good. Boarding process: From the gate it was terribly messy, but once you stepped onto the airbridge everything was smooth. The ground staff in charge of boarding was not from Malaysia Airlines. Not clear in their instructions, which led to people travelling without children to begin rushing to board even if they did specifically say for travellers with young children. Inflight Entertainment was extremely slow to respond, and often needed to be pressed twice or thrice for the system to process the command. Not a very good music folder, and lacked songs from the charts. Kids were left disappointed with the lack of children's movies as well. Usually, I watch movies throughout the whole flight, no matter if it is a red eye flight, but this time, there just wasn't any movies with appeal, which lead up to me listening to the same music over and over and falling asleep to that. Apart from those downfalls, it was a pretty good flight overall."

They were not only efficient, but also friendly, genuine and made me feel very welcome. I liked that they took the time to properly describe the food options, rather than just saying ""chicken or fish"". They made a few drink rounds. The couple in front of me had a baby, and the crew were diligently checking on them during the flight to make sure that they were ok and had everything that they needed. The aircraft was clean, including the toilets. The entertainment unit was ok, but nothing to shout about. All in all I was happy with the experience."

As this was a holiday with great expectations I booked Business Class with Malaysia Airlines. While booking, I had cheaper options from Malindo Air and a slightly higher price from Singapore Airlines but I decided to go ahead with MAS. Check in experience was good and welcomed with smiles. Counter staff explained that there was a 60 minute delay and promised updates will be passed on through lounge staff. Also received a call from MAS call centre about the delay and I was satisfied with the way I was kept informed. Waited at lounge until 22:00 with no update from staff (departure was meant to be 2125). I went to the gate only to find the flight is not ready and is rescheduled to 00:05. At 00:30 enquired with the counter staff about the revised timings and informed that it may take one more hour. We finally departed flight at 03:30 Hrs - a good 6 hour delay. Onboard at my seat (5A) to my utter surprise trash was not cleared from seat pockets and material from the previous flight and was removed by staff when asked. To my astonishment towels and welcome drink were offered to some passengers but not all (including me). More surprises in store for me on this flight. My call button was not working. TV remote not functioning. I called the supervisor from the service area to show all the defects and he blamed maintenance and communication systems. Due to this, even breakfast could not requested and for coffee I had to go to the service area and ask one of the staff. I requested information about my connection between KUL-DPS but none of the staff had any idea but assured me that I will be accommodated on the next available flight. On disembarking at KUL, MAS staff gave me a new boarding pass and made me rush to the gate as it was a short connection. On enquiring about baggage no one has any info but assured me it will reach my destination. Reached DPS waited at the baggage carousel for a good 45 min until the belt stopped. Went around to enquire at baggage services counter and after verifying and lot of internal discussion they asked me to wait as some baggage is coming in at 17:25. Now, being a Business Class traveller I feel I have a right to know whether my bags are loaded or not and it is the airlines duty to inform me of this and not to waste my time. After a good 75 min wait the staff say they will send my bag later once it is arrived."

The Sydney leg on the A330 was not as great, very cramped aircraft and small IFE screens so didn't bother using it. Food and service was good again though. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive.

There has been an unfortunate drop in quality in the whole travel experience with Malaysia Airlines. On my flight from Auckland to Kuala Lumpur, I found the crew unfriendly and perfunctory. At times I found them condescending towards passengers. A request for a hot drink by my neighbour was met by a curt ""the seatbelt sign is on, and an announcement has already been made"" rather than a polite declination. The crew seemed more interested in talking amongst each other in the galley rather than checking on passengers (they were usually only seen around meal times). The toilet was in an unacceptable state from the start of the flight. The bits under the sink were broken and held together by duct tape. The floor was sticky the whole time. I don't think it was cleaned throughout the flight. The good thing about the flight was that the pilot was professional and communicated well to all the passengers. Our plane had a technical glitch and we had to wait on the tarmac for 2.5 hours. He updated us very regularly and kept us at ease. Other plus points were the cheap fares and that the check in process was a breeze using the app. I will keep flying with them because they are my only direct option, but I hope there will be an improvement in terms of crew friendliness and aircraft cleanliness."

I used to fly Malaysia Airlines frequently to and from Asia but haven't needed to visit locations they serve recently. Very happy to see the aircraft was an A380 rather than a 787 and the flight and service were both very good. Plenty of legroom in economy (BA and Virgin Atlantic Boeing 787 economy legroom is a disgrace!) and food selection good with attentive cabin crew. Nice snack packs offered for mid-flight nibbles (cake, cheese and crackers, nuts). Aircraft interior a bit shabby which is surprising considering its relative youth. My only gripe would be the toilets. Unlike the other large Asian carries (e.g. Cathay Pacific, JAL, Singapore etc) no attention was given to the toilets by the cabin crew and they were definitely not clean even at the start of the flight and not serviced during flight. Twice I had to ask cabin crew for new hand towels and toilet tissues and I noticed others had to do the same. The toilets/washrooms are in dire need of a deep clean and through the the aircraft, things like loose trim and bits of tape holding light fittings in place really do need attention!! Apart from these niggles, a good flight and would happily fly again, possibly bring some spare toilet tissue though!"
✅ Verified Review ,A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to CGK via KUL,January 2017,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We flew Malaysia Airlines from Jakarta to London return via Kuala Lumpur, because it was cheap. Leaving Jakarta was no problem except for no on-line check in facility. The return trip was a whole different story. We had to change dates - at a substantial premium - but that was our choice. The issue was seating. We always take a 2-seat option, window and aisle. That was not available on the new flight, but no one told us. When I came to check in online, I could not locate any reference to our seats, the numbers for which still appeared on the website to be in a 2-seat configuration. (The website is confusing if, like me and about 10% of males, you are color-blind, as one cannot distinguish between taken and free seats. Why colour code? – most airlines simply put a cross on taken seats.) We had now been arbitrarily allocated new seat numbers – window and middle - but I was still under the impression that we might be able to get the 2-seat configuration. I printed the boarding passes. My son then spent a considerable time on the phone to Malaysia Airlines in London (?) but could get no sense out of the person he spoke to. For most of the conversation, we were still being led to believe that there was a two-seat section, and were trying to retrieve our original seats. Then, Malaysia Airlines decided that there was no availability, as this A380 was different to the outbound one. An offer to pay for an upgrade was declined, but he claimed to have now reactivated our old seat numbers. At the airport, check-in was carried out by a very curt lady, who had no interest in the fact that we had confirmed seats on one document but different seats on the printed-out boarding pass. “The original seats are gone!” Then we came to our baggage. We were overweight (we always are) but for the first time ever in my experience, they insisted on including our carry-ons in our total weight and charging us for that. So we then had to leave the check in and go to another counter to pay. More problems. The check-in lady had indicated that each of our carry-ons weighed 18kg! I demonstrated to the excess baggage lady that I could lift both with one hand (I am 71 and no athlete) and so an 18kg weight seemed unlikely. After further delay, Malaysia Airlines kindly charged us for only one carry on, checking the other. I have been travelling internationally since the mid-60s. I can only remember ever being charged for excess baggage twice – no complaints about that – but for carry on? Throughout all this, I had been trying to check in to our connecting flight from KL to Jakarta. Neither the website, phone person, nor Heathrow check-in lady, nor gate service, could find us. Finally we were curtly told to sort it out in KL transit. Hardly reassuring, when we only had a one hour transit time. Malaysia Airlines KL transit were useless. First, they blamed Garuda, since it was a codeshare and told me to sort it out with them. I politely declined, as the contract was with Malaysia Airlines; if they subcontract, it was up to them to deal with their subcontractor. Then we were told that the Garuda flight did not exist - which was why we could not check in – and we were to be booked on a Malaysia Airlines flight an hour later - if there were seats. I insisted that they find us seats on that flight, and miraculously the non-existent Garuda flight reappeared. So we got home – in the overall scheme of things little of this matters – except that I will never fly Malaysia Airlines again. For an airline trying to rebuild a reputation, this is not the way to do it!"

On 2nd January while flying MH192 departure time 21.00, I was told to park my scooter on the aerobridge and board the plane, which I did with my husband's assistance. They normally put it in the cargo section. the captain happened to see the scooter on the bridge and refused to load it for fear of the sealed lead acid battery blowing up. All the passengers were seated and waiting for take off. The negotiations between us, the captain and the ground staff took 1hr 30 minutes. Even after assuring him that I had travelled to Sydney in their own airline with the scooter on 9th and 29th December, he refused to allow it initially. Finally, a ground staff member showed him the manual for checking in electric scooters. We finally took off 1hr 30mins later all because of nobody knew what to do with an electric scooter including the captain. It is shocking that such for a major airline not knowing the standard operating procedures for electric scooters, more so the captain."

First flight delayed 1 hour from Bangkok with the usual but useless excuse of “due to late arriving aircraft”. Check-in smooth. Gate not announced until 45 minutes before departure and was from a very remote gate through cumbersome and humiliating bus service – not very common in BKK. This gave an initial feeling going with a Low Cost Carrier. Business class full on first sector (12 of 16 seats taken) and much less on 2nd sector (4 of 16 seats taken). Onboard service fine and food was very good and tasty with three options. Lack of any alcoholic drinks for serving is a disaster that deprives MH a lot of potential customers. Smooth luggage handling. A very cheap business class ticket which was only slightly more expensive than direct routing with Bangkok Airways (in economy) - made me take the trouble to deroute myself through Kuala Lumpur.

I called the call center and after spending more than 30 minutes communicating with the agent, I was informed that I could not upgrade because my fare class did not allow it. I tried again during check-in, and I was told that it was possible to upgrade but I would only be given economy class meal. This was emphasized several times by the ground crew. I found this rule to be utterly ridiculous as I was paying the full cash amount to upgrade. Besides, there were 4 options for the ""main dish"" so why bother getting an economy class meal instead of giving me whatever option's left from business class. The problem was not the meal itself, I could not care less if the meal is from business or economy. The problem was I felt singled out from the service and it really ruined the whole business class experience. Lounge was rather disappointing in terms of the food option and bathroom cleanliness. Onboard the cabin crew was friendly and attentive. However, I did notice that I was not addressed by name whereas the passengers around me were. And I was also not offered any drinks when I woke up, whereas the passengers around me were offered coffee when the cabin crew noticed they had just woken up. Overall, I found Malaysia Airlines to be very disappointing in the service aspect. My money will definitely go to other airlines as they will give me the ""full treatment"" as a full paying business passenger, whether I purchased the ticket up front or decided to upgrade at the last minute."

Two hours delay in early morning flight especially for connecting passengers from long haul international flight is bad. Plus, the poor customer service added to the misery. The staff raised voice to customer asking for the delay flight. Changing gate without announcement and left it to passengers to constantly look at the screen for update. Other than that, the Malaysia Airlines staff were excellent. Especially the call center. Our tickets booked online and no notification on the website that our payment has gone through. Called service center and was picked up almost instanteneously and everything sorted professionally by the staff."

I booked in early April 2016 for a flight via KUL to London departing 22 July. My wife and I paid for premium seats between KKUL and London, Row 39, paying an extra $100. On checking in we were placed in rows 72 and 78 for the MH2 leg. No explanation, or refund, has been forthcoming despite asking for refunds and lodging two complaints. After many requests we were provided with seats together next to the toilet. By far the worst long-haul flight we have ever undertaken. We have emailed numerous people in the hierarchy, without receiving a response to our requests for both an explanation and a refund. We upgraded to business class on the way home as we could not obtain a guarantee that our pre-paid seats (Row 39) were going to be available for the trip back to KL. Obviously Malaysia Airlines does not care about customer feedback or service. After numerous flights with them, at least ten in the previous twelve years, I have decided they are seriously lacking in customer service and will not fly with them again. They do not deserve my, or my families, custom. Their cabin staff are exceptionally helpful, but their back office staff are hopeless!"

Malaysia Airlines business class product has worsened considerably in the last two years. If you are very lucky the aircraft look fresh and clean, but very often their planes look tired. It worries me when it is difficult to hold your business class seat in an upright position as expected on departure/landing. Malaysia Airlines management decided that no alcohol will be offered in regional and domestic flights. I respect and understand that muslims don´t touch alcohol, but when I, a non muslim, travel on business class on an international route cannot have a glass of wine, I don´t appreciate it.  The last four segments I flew with Malaysia Airlines had a late departure - up to 1.5 hour. Next time I will use a low cost carrier to Malaysia, eg. Air Asia. They have newer equipment, you know what you pay for and are generally on time."

The positive stops there. The crew onboard were rushing through service to retire early onboard the flight with one round of drinks served. The meal was mediocre at best and has been one of the cost cutting measures by the airline. Entertainment selection was mediocre at best and the controls work rather intermittently or rather, a tad slow. The seat pitch was horrendous and comparable to those of a budget carrier, it just felt tight, Jetstar Pacific new aircraft has better seat pitch than them! Ground staff at KLIA were more interested in their own conversations than serving the passengers and it seems rather unprofessional. Upon landing, we had to wait for another gate as the gate that it was supposed to park at was still occupied by another MH aircraft. Planning as such should be done beforehand to ensure that such issues do not occur, as there were many other available parking bays at KLIA. "

Disappointing really, especially on our return journey. Food was very ordinary and coffee (when you finally got it) revolting. Most staff were friendly and efficient, but not all. We were misdirected to wrong queue in Phuket despite querying the instruction which meant we only just make the flight. The plane on the return flight, an A330, was not the most comfortable. Baggage took forever to get offloaded in Adelaide though I understand this is out of the control of Malaysia Airlines. Overall, I felt that this airline is doing things on the cheap."

The flight was delayed arriving in Manila and the 1:15pm flight departed closer to 3:00pm. Apart from the long delay, for which no apology was announced by the crew, the aircraft was tired and old. Nowadays whether one gets a new B737-800 or the older ones (but at the same premium MH ticket fees) is like a lottery when taking Malaysia Airlines. There was no IFE. I was in seat 5A and the magazine holder was broken. The same too for Seat 5B; literaly falling off at the hinges. The meal served was not good. The crew were pleasant and trying their best and the pilots did an excellent job of flying thru turbulence. Malaysia Airlines management crows regularly about how it has 'turned around' the airline, but unfortunately seem to be still turning with no end in sight to reclaim its position as a world class airline. Its a pity. I only hope they fix these problems. It can be done, take a good look a what Garuda has achieved in the last 5 years. Now that is a real turn around."

Seats on the upper deck are hard to come by so please book it in advance if you prefer them. IFE was good but I wish they had the variety that other airlines have. Landing was smooth and the choice of Terminal 4 is really good because it is not very busy. The outgoing flight back to KUL was also a breeze and the crew were once again on their toes the entire flight serving juices and water every hour and ensuring that we were comfortable. However, I would like to suggest to the management to please maintain the A380 well until the new A350 arrive: the aircraft has seen better days. Good flights overall."

Otherwise it would have been a horrible flight having to sit upright for 9 hours on a red eye. Entertainment system in newly assigned seats had an electrical short in the ear phone jack and kept cutting-out. Seats only recline to about 160 degrees - leaving you at an uncomfortable angle where you slide down while trying to sleep. Ordered Chef OnCall meal from menu previous to flight. Food was lukewarm and the steak was not edible. Staff very friendly and provided very good inflight service. Inflight entertainment selection OK. Flight departed and landed on time. Given the price for this route was about 30% cheaper then any other carrier, can't really complain too much - just an average experience.

Cleanliness is poor, as you can see stains everywhere from the seat pocket to the window.  Meal was a big dissapointment, a plain ""roti canai"" with curry dhall as the condiment. Was served with juice and coffee few minutes later, but coffee was so mild it tasted like an instant coffee. Only 2 cabin crews operating economy class and their servce is just ok, nothing impressive. When can this airline improve?

The seat are with auto adjustment functions and can extend into flat bed, the new design including a genuine extra room for storage and large TV screen.

Although Malaysia Airlines is not nearly as good as the old 5-Star airline, my flight was still a pleasant one. Excellent service, good food, fantastic seats and ample leg room. Well maintained lavatories on the upper deck of the A380, but cabin felt slightly outdated compared, no mood lighting. In flight entertainment could be improved by adding more asian choices and a subtitle option (instead of forcing either an Arab, Chinese or English subtitle on each movie). AVOD should also include other language interface such as Mandarin. Also, with respect, felt that the flight could do without it's pre-flight prayers as MAS markets itself as a secular and global airline. Nevertheless, always find a special charm to Malaysian crews.

A snack box was also given out. I managed 7 hours okay sleep on the 13hr 30 min flight. Breakfast served 2 hours out of Heathrow which was also good for economy. Arrived T4 on time.

This time, it was even more worth mentioning because of the special upgrade. I travelled to Kuala Lumpur to meet an old friend on their very special economy class ticket. Outbound on an 737, I must admit the economy seat was a bit cramped, lucky a small lady was next to me, but the service and food was fine. Inbound, I was not eligible for their MH upgrade offer online because the class of my ticket (N), I inquired at check in, I was told that in exactly 2 hours before the scheduled flight time, one can get to the ticket office to arrange for a ""last minute"" upgrade, should there be seats available. Luckily, there was plenty, being a big aircraft (seasonal). It only cost me MYR590 one way, a real bargain. A new biz class boarding reissued. The only conditions were of course no extra mileage accrual, plus I will only be served economy class meal, but the rest is biz class. Come time for boarding, I was given priority. When in the air, here's what I got: Welcome drinks (including alcohol), hot towels, newspaper, their signature satay, after dinner hot drinks and desserts. The meal was from economy, but served on a nice tray with table cloth, metal cutlery and all the rest, you would hardly notice you're eating an economy meal. The cabin crew were very attentive to me, they were fascinated with the low price of my upgrade, and treated me with the same attentiveness and kindness just like any other Biz class passengers. I think, one of the key issue here is to be polite to them at all times, cabin crew normally will appreciate that, and don't mind to go extra mile to provide service. I was very impressed with the whole experience, plus the occasional use of a larger plane. Rest assured, MH really does make an effort and still a great airlines to fly with."

I generally like Malaysia Airlines although I've not used them for about 1 year, and this was the first time on their A380. Check in at T4 London Heathrow was quick and polite, fast track security pretty good, Malaysia Airlines operate their own lounge at T4 and while small is very nice with a good food and drink selection. Boarding through gate 6B was organised, and seat 16H at the rear of the upper deck business class cabin was okay. It's not the 1-2-1 offered on many airlines although it has plenty of room and I personally found the seat comfortable. The IFE was okay although the map wasn't great but otherwise okay, the aircraft itself was also a bit run down and probably due an upgrade. Service was great from a friendly pleasant crew, the food comprised dinner, a mid flight snack and breakfast, which was well presented and tasted pretty good. Arrived KUL 20 min early, used the MH satellite lounge which was pretty busy at 7am, breakfast and drinks available - although like the aircraft the lounge could do with a makeover. Boarding the flight to Phnom Penh a bit chaotic through gate G10, seat 1F on a clean looking Boeing 737-800. Departed on time, once airborne breakfast served which was okay, crew very nice, unlike most European regional flights Malaysia Airlines still offer a 2-2 real business class seats comfy for this 1hr 45min flight which arrived on time.

The carpet in business class was threadbare in places leaving the undercover exposed. Doors to seat side cabinets didn't close. The seat itself was dirty and clearly a thorough cleaning of the surrounds had not taken place because when I fully reclined the seat a plastic bag fell out, and so too a ripped up customs declaration form along with some other debris. Food choices were limited and on the KL to Melbourne leg they had already run out of one of the main course before they got to me. Despite being in business class. My business class seat on the KL to Melbourne leg was in the middle row leaving a ridiculously tight fit for my legs once the seat had been fully reclined to a bed. In order to exit the 'bed' you had to bring the seat back to the upright position in order to be able to swivel your legs out from the little nook in which they sat when lying down. Entertainment choices were sparse and the selection of ""Latest Releases"" was hilariously small. Staff were earnest in their attempts to offer a professional service but there were mishaps and mistakes. The check ins at both London and Melbourne was not with out incident. London took over 50 minutes for business class which must be some sort of record. In Melbourne on the return leg I was told ""I am logging off as my shift has ended so try the next counter"". That's a first in my many years of travelling for business. The lounges in Melbourne and London offer the bare necessities whilst the KL Lounge was more befitting that of HQ as it should be. I can see why they offer fares at a discount to the major airlines. They need to in order to attract the clientele and your experience is a discounted one."

Checked in from transit in Bangkok required some patience and permission from the airport manager (why? They claimed because I came from an LCC?) I had only carry on luggage with me so could not see any disadvantage on their side. Got checked in on an earlier departure (for free) after request as the transit in KUL otherwise would have been 70 Minutes only. Pre-departure drinks provided. Hot towels. Great attention from FAs. The lack of alcoholic drinks available for the BKK-KUL sector, which is a big fault in my view. Golden regional lounge in KUL is good with showers, views, and spas. Aircrafts were almost full. Food onboard OK but not top class. IFE is OK, but not of my main interest. Worse is lack of ice, cheese, smoothies, booze, or other refinements.

Arrived 5 hours early to SGN Airport and found an MH check-in counter for an earlier flight not yet closed.

All 4 flights were on time, carried out by ageing, fuel-demanding, and noisy B737-800 – all were well maintained, though. OW elite card respected and generously rewarded a lot of miles for these 4 flights. Service onboard was absolutely fine. Food was generally good – at 3 or 4 star level. The alcohol ban for MH on regional flights (less than 3 hours, but not always consistent) shows and obviously hits hard for several passengers – especially on the evening flights. As the KUL-MNL-KUL legs was more than 3 hours duration, alcohol was available but only discretely served on specific demands. There was no wine list - only soft drinks appeared on menu cards. Only on the long leg on the way back, MNL-KUL, a wine list were provided. Pre-departure drinks offered and, on the 2 long legs, even champagne was offered. Seats are old, classical, soft business class with extended recline – perfect for medium haul flights. A good airline though recent cost saving measures appear. Alcoholic drinks should be offered on all regional flights if the airline will regain full popularity.

Most aircraft's are in newer configuration with AVOD, but not well maintained and found some minor problem around (e.g. seat cannot be kept upright) while one flight is in an extremely old aircraft without any entertainment and thin, dirty cushion. Toilets ranged from very well stocked to nothing. Their catering is great though, every meal was tasty and portions were very large. Flight attendants were very friendly, tried their best to keep the flight enjoyable. One of my complaints is that they enforce strict policy of 2 bags within 40 kgs, I can't carry 3 bags that weight just 25 kgs in total."

First Leg Check in was a nightmare, unable to print boarding pass prior and rely on Bag drop, which resulted in a 90 minute queue for check in (only 5 agents for 300 odd passengers) not a good start. Boarding was quite good if you held back and boarded after the mass. First time on an A380 and was looking forward to this, it is a sea of people on the lower deck and the seat advise would be to fight for an economy seat in the upper deck. Back to my trip, IFE screen was good size with USB outlet, viewing selection was very good and i could find something to watch all the time (13 hours) flight tracker was a bit dated. Times must be hard at Malaysia Airlines as the inflight pack was non existent, blanket, pillow and headset, no socks, eye shade, toothbrush anything and after 13 hour flight my mouth tasted like, well not pleasant. Seat was the most comfortable I have experienced, it reclined in such a way it made it relatively easy to get a sleep and be at ease for this duration. Cabin crew were very very efficient they did the rounds like a rash they were warm enough to feel served by them it was a well run ship so to speak. Meals and snack box were good as was the regular hydration runs. I enjoyed the A380 experience it does really feel more relaxing and hope Airbus will seriously think about its future rather - the down side to this trip was out of Malaysia Airlines control due to ATC in Europe we sat in Heathrow for 2 hours. 2nd Leg to Kuala Terengganu, B738, haven't been one of these for years but MAS have decked them out pretty well with IFE and leather seats, 45 minutes a bag of peanuts and a drink and we were there, however due to a short, less than 20 minutes transfer time our bags didn't make it, now this is the rub, would you rather make the transfer and not get your bags or want to have a night in KL and travel with your bags after 3 couples dealing with MAS in Kuala Terranguna for over an hour I think I would travel with the bags."

Had 4 flights with Malaysia Airlines in 3 weeks, not one of them took off on time, the delays were between 40 minutes and 2 hours and each time we were boarded onto the plane only to sit there and wait all this time. So on the flight out of London we had been on the plane almost 3 hours before we were offered a drink. On all flights I found the staff unhelpful and uninformative. They offered no advice about missed connections on the way out and on the way back my TV stopped working 3 hours before we landed, I informed the crew and they didn't do anything at all. There was a huge mess up with seating on the way back, despite booking my seats online well in advance, upon check in they tried to put me be my husband on opposite sides of the plane. Similar things had clearly happened to other people as it was mayhem on board with people trying to move around, families being split up etc and the staff were less than useless. Getting a drink on an Malaysia Airlines flight is almost impossible, they came around with a tray of water or juice 3 times in a 14 hour flight and only did a proper drinks cart once. They don't put a menu out so at meal time you get a choice of chicken or fish and haven't got a clue what comes with them, it's like feeding time at the zoo, the staff are so unorganised!

However, something happened to restore my faith in the airline. I received a letter from the CEO of the company offering me a free flight. Wonderful! Well, no actually because once I tried to book my free flight using the instructions on the letter I came across a wall of evasion and obstruction. I have had several pointless phone calls and sent many unanswered e-mails. I have encountered the worst customer relations imaginable and still no flight. What should have been a simple process has become a game of smoke and mirrors. Is it wearing me down? Yes it is. Am I giving up? Not likely. I'll soldier on. It's become a matter of principle now.

✅ Verified Review ,A380,Business,Economy Class,SIN to LHR via KUL,June 2016,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2,no,2,"  At the time of booking with Malaysian Airlines and unlike other Oneworld alliance partners it is not possible to ascertain the fare class being booked and therefore the miles and points to be awarded to your frequent flyer program. I made a seamless round trip reservation from Singapore to London with a stopover in Kuala Lumpar. At the check in Singapore when I was given my boarding passes for both legs I asked if my miles had been credited and was assured that that was the case. The same scenario applied to my return trip. Upon my return and having retained the relevant boarding passes I made various online checks to my account to see if the miles and Cathay Pacific points had been credited to my account. On 08/07/16 the miles corresponding to the short leg from Singapore to Kuala Lumpar were credited but since then there has been no activity. I made an initial enquiry with Malaysian Airlines on 29/07/16 and subsequent follow up on 19/08/16 to which I have received zero response. On 19/08/16 I contacted Cathay Pacific in relation to the missing miles. I received a call from Hong Kong less than two hours after having sent a fax. I was informed that they would be following up with Malaysia Airlines with regards to the missing air miles for the Kuala Lumpar to Singapore leg but as the fare class indicated on the Kuala Lumpar to London and return boarding passes was different to the short Singapore to KL leg I was not entitled to any air miles. I have since contacted Malaysia Airlines yet again but to no avail. For passengers looking to accrue air miles and points if applicable in order to maintain their tier status, check carefully when booking with Malaysia Airlines as there is no indication when booking as to any entitlement. Moreover the fare class is not even stated on the travel itinerary receipt. I should also add that the price I paid for my return ticket from Singapore to London was no cheaper than those offered by other One World partners yet they all offer air miles. As for the actual flights I was not impressed with this carrier. The service was lacklustre, the food average and the A380 craft were showing their age. It also proved difficult to be served an alcoholic drink. The connecting flight from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore left two hours after the scheduled departure."

We flew business class from Kuala Lumpur to Denpasar on MH715. Equipment is an old Boeing 737-800 which is totally acceptable for a short 3-hour flight however the cabin was filthy and shortly after boarding.  Having flown with Qatar Airways and Cathay Pacific the previous day, Malaysia Airlines food, service and hard product is nowhere near in comparison which was a huge let down. The nearly inedible breakfast was served in a single tray by flight attendants who pretty much disappeared after putting the tray down with the exception of one flight attendant who was chatting with what I can understand a colleague, seated right across the aisle, with her fiance, getting married in Bali. The conversation started as soon as we boarded and continued during meal service and not once I noticed this flight attendant serving other passengers except chatting to her colleague while continually topping up their alcoholic drinks. Meanwhile we, and other passengers, have to ask for a coffee or juice as not once either of these were offered. From the point-of-view of a revenue passenger, this it totally unacceptable. We were looking forward to a great flight with MH but had very negative views of the airline after this unpleasant experience."

I flew this carrier due to the competitive pricing for this route. I was pleasantly greeted with nice cabin crew who helped me with my baggage. The plane took of a minutes later but landed on time at KLIA. The counter staff doesn't really smile much and the seats are old and the seat pockets are stained.  I often opt for the seafood and it taste good but not worth a second mention. Now they use the box like a bento and serve the food which I find is much faster to clear than the standard trays. The portions were good for a 1 hour 30 mins of flying time. Using an old IFE but it didn't have and issues. Overall it was a good experience if you paid for the lower end of the price as it can't match Thai or SQ quality service. Minimal service but the crew did the best.

For the SGN to KUL, the plane came in on time and departed on time. Cabin crew were professional and smiled but were visibly tired. Food was average to good, served hot from the oven into a box which I think is easier to clean rather than using a tray. IFE is not responsive but the console was able to counter the issue. Mid flight the cabin crew went down to close all the window shades to allow passengers to get some shut eye and offered pillows and blankets and drinks. The downside of departing from SGN is that the ground crew from SGN are poor in customer service as they are mostly locals and that the airports reputation was known to be poor in their airport rating in 2015. However the next leg, KUL to SIN, was a bit messy as the plane was delayed 45 minutes due to late arrival of the aircraft from Tawau. So I arrived in Singapore at 0050h instead of 0005h. As a form of compensation the crew surprised us with ice cream onboard along with peanuts and juice which left us feeling better. Overall it was a pleasant flight but again the cleanliness is still not up to spotless just yet."

Since a few months back, all flight services under 3 hours have removed their bar service which was a bit of a downer as we could not have a wider range of drinks to choose from. But the cost cutting measures seem to be working as the air tickets I bought were comparable to budget carriers flying out of KLIA. The flight was smooth and boarding was efficient due tot the low volume as it was an odd time to fly. Cabin crew was experienced and was able to comfort passengers, allowing them to feel a relax by providing pillows and blankets. They were fast to respond to the request and would kneel down to listen to your request in a kebaya which is quite a feat. They crew were lovely but the cleanliness of the aircraft, was poorly maintained. When queried about the cleanliness, I came to understand that the previous flight suffered moderate turbulence thus tea and coffee stains were everywhere. Overall I think they did their best to clean before the next set of passengers came onboard. It was an average to a good experience."

Not too shabby, the usual peanuts and juice was offered. Drink services were offered twice for a 40 minute flight. Newspapers were offered and the cabin crew would offer to collect your coats and store it in the closet. Pretty standard service. Kuala Lumpur to Ho Chi Minh City flight was bumpy and turbulent probably due to the pick up of the monsoon season but the pilots manage to keep it steady. Meals were of good portion if you considered that the plane was only in the air for 1h 30 mins. A simple seafood fried rice or chicken murtabak was offered with a choice of orange or apple juice - the food choice would be better if they had one western dish and one local as I find that it might be hard for others to appreciate the food. The cabin crew were doing a great job and were very attentive and offered pillows. The seats were normal standard and the space was decent. There is an issue about the IFE as the screen is not as responsive to touch but that can be countered by using the remote which was very responsive. The downside is that the plane was not very clean. But overall Malaysia Airlines still lives up to a full service flight. Occasionally there will be very cheap offers provide each month on certain routes that make the return trip cheaper than the budget carriers but you just have to transit at KUL.

MH had regained my confidence in them in every area, and I hope to see them keep improving, and earn back some stars which Skytrax had removed since 2014. I feel this struggling airlines deserve some support to help them get back on track to its former glory."

Boarding was smooth, the cabin crew showed no hospitality, no smile, service was noticeably stiff and cold. Food - I can see the budget cut here, plastic utensils and no salt nor pepper. I asked for a special meal (No Lactose), they gave me 2 super salty slices of chicken, soggy hash brown and a hunk of omelette. The window were surprisingly dirty for the first flight of the day. The return flight was much better. No hassle from boarding - take off - cruising altitude. FAs are much more friendlier, presentable and professional than the departing flight. Again, ordered the non-lactose meal for my dinner. They gave me grilled fish (either snapper or sea bass) with potato wedges and steamed vegetables; a little bland, so I had to ask the FAs to get salt and pepper. We were given chocolate covered ice cream, which is nice, if you're not lactose intolerant. Turns out the dessert part was left out from the special meal request. Not a deal breaker, but still. The IFE was decent. Touch screen tend to go a little unresponsive at times, and the cable of the remote was too short so I had to hold it awkwardly."

It took a while to leave Heathrow due to technical faults and they didn't make up the lost time en route. I expected delays and sure enough I missed my connecting flight in KL but they were quite organised when I arrived. Replacement boarding passes were printed and ready and I was directed to the boarding gate. Food on board was much better than that previously served on board the Singapore Airlines flights a few months prior. Generous leg room too. Would fly them again.

The quality of food was patchy and drinks selection very limited. The only downside is the long layover at KLIA. Five hours on both runs. The MH lounge is comfortable but dated.

The older plane had no seat back tv and I can live without it on a 2 hour flight. My only gripe on landing at KL a member of ground staff had a sign for Bangkok and I busted a gut to get through security etc only to be told at boarding there were 2 flights to BKK and I was trying to get on the wrong one.

We were given one announcement 2 hours into the delay saying there was a mechanical fault, obviously this happens and is understandable, what isn't is how it has been handled. We had to seek out information about when the new departure time was, the only person manning the Malaysia airlines office said the aircraft would depart at midnight, that was an estimate made 4 hours ago, he has now gone home while we are all still stranded. We haven't seen anyone work on the aircraft for the past 3 hours and it's been parked with its cargo door open, abandoned the whole time, there is not one Malaysia Airlines representative in the terminal and at the moment we are supposed to leave in an hour and a half, that's what we were told 4 hours ago. No apologies or reimbursement has been offered for missing connecting flights, regardless of carrier or to put us up in a hotel or pay for food. This has been a massive failure in both organisation, planning and customer service. You cannot claim to be a premium carrier when your contingency plans are worse than any budget airline."

Great food choices as well and was able to pre-order option online prior to departure if you want it. The staff were really good - always addressed by name, nothing was any trouble at all and they were always smiling. Connecting flight at KL was very easy good signage and quick couple of minutes on the monorail shuttle to boarding gate. We had very tight connection 1 hour and had no trouble at all. Return flight was even tighter with only 40 minutes but we managed without any problems. Well worth the money and worth trying if you have never travelled with them before. The only slight let down was the films and TV but really it was just a minor issue and would not stop me flying again.

In the seat pockets there were sweet wrappers and on the tray table coffee stains from the previous flight. On the Kuala Lumpur to London Heathrow sector of our journey I experienced an allergic reaction to the blankets provided. My arms began to swell up and become itchy and covered in a rash which was pretty uncomfortable. I went to the galley to ask one of the crew if I could have anti allergy tablets, but they said they do not carry these tablets on board and offered me paracetamol and ice to put on the rash. Having worked for a couple of airlines myself I was pretty taken back by this response as for the airlines I've worked for anti allergy tablets are pretty standard. Plus I'm not quite sure what paracetamol would have done for an allergic reaction. I had to endure another 9 hours of itching and general discomfort which could have been avoided should the airline have had these standard allergy tablets. "

I have flown with Malaysia Airlines on several occasions - including twice from Adelaide to Paris with my wife in Business Class. We joined their loyalty program (Enrich) so that we could use the points from all our work and holiday trips to upgrade later flights. Next September (2016) my friends and I are going to Phuket and I have tried countless times to get the return trip upgraded using my Enrich points. Without exaggeration, I have called the Enrich number 12 times. On a number of these occasions I was lucky enough to be able to leave my contact telephone number and get a call back. On these occasions I was told my request was in a queue and that I would need to ring back on a certain date - which I did. Every Malaysia Airlines representative I've spoken with has told me something different. For the last 3 days I can't leave my return number on a ring-back because their recording doesn't seem to be working now. When I ring the complaints line - the line gets automatically cut off. Malaysia Airlines was very eager to take my money for Business Class tickets for my wife and me and for a number of other work and holiday trips to/from Malaysia - but not very happy to provide me with an upgrade using the Enrich points I've earned. My advice - joining Enrich is a waste of time and money. Their representatives (when you're lucky enough to be able to get through) don't speak English very well and, even though they make promises, nothing is done. Fly with an airline that values its customers."

Check-in was robotic. Boarding was done efficiently. On board, a nice welcome from a member of staff but after that, it was all perfunctory and not very friendly. Staff seem to be more interested in finishing up their service quickly and disappearing into the galley. The seat was one of the new business class seats. These seats really confuse me. Why not use the herringbone arrangement instead of those large and bulky storage areas beside the seat? I would have preferred more seat width and less storage area. The seat controls were not working very well and the seat kept going into recline mode as I kept hitting the button accidentally. Some genius located the panel at elbow level! When the seat lies flat, you are cocooned in a little pit which makes you feel like you're in a coffin as the seat sinks well below the arm rest. Badly designed seat which is better as a recliner than a flat bed. The food was noting to shout home about. The tray table was abysmal in size and all meals were served on a tray. The pillow is a small, thin square which is not very supportive. Is it worth the money? I do not think so.

The meal service was slightly odd; I had used the chef on call option and the first serving was fine but later one of the FAs told me that they no longer did a second full meal service (on a 13.5 hr flight in business class!) and that I had to choose something from what looked like a snack menu but then later they brought my chef on call order out anyway.

The sandwich served on the return flight was marginally better. I had the same aisle seat on both flights - the older plane to BKK had more leg space but no IFE. The new plane on the return journey had a good selection of movies and music, but leg space was a lot less due to it having a broad black metal support.

Good selection of IFE movies but the headphones are of poor quality and thus ruins the experience. Flight Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur at 5pm was a different story. Ground staff were very good - managed my request for a stand-by for an earlier flight well - and so were the cabin crew. The aircraft was a leased B737-800 - tired, no IFE etc. Then they served something that was an insult to Malaysia - something called a Fish Noodle (only choice by the time it got to the back row of the aircraft).

In the recent past, it has served up a good business class product, offering discounted prices you can't find elsewhere, but lately the quality of service has started to deteriorate. for starters, the flights I take most often are Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur return for which MH schedules 7 flights in each direction. Yet, there's not a great level of reliability on these actually flying, as I've discovered. Malaysia Airlines sometimes cancels some of these on short notice if the loads are light and then they seek to combine flight loads. Today was one such case. So my 5:10pm flight cancelled less than 24 hours out and I got an email from MH telling me that I was rebooked on the 6.40pm flight to KL - so my plans for an evening meeting in KL were scrapped. We've all seen the wide-body aircraft taken off the regional routes (today's use of an A330 on this flight was a rare exception) and ""meals"" in Economy have become boxes while offerings in Business Class have become less remarkable. But today, I discovered that Malaysia Airlines has suddenly stopped serving any form of alcoholic beverage on its regional flights under 3 hours in duration, even in business class! This is really too much. I asked cabin crew for the story behind this, and they empathized, noting that it was a crazy management decision announced without any consultations with staff. So, no more wine or champagne on the flights to Bali, no beer at the end of a hard day of Jakarta meetings. This seems to be a great way to drive away business.

Having flown similar routes to Australasia on 4 previous occasions I have a benchmark by which I can judge others. Malaysia Airlines was my worst experience to date. The cabin crew were efficient at best, but lacked any personal attributes. No smiles or personal interaction. The males were particularly surly/arrogant. The food was poor, lacking choice and imagination, similar meals being served for lunch and dinner. Noodles, Rice and Chicken seemed to be the mainstay. Onboard entertainment was very American based, eg Comedy TV was all American series which otherwise would never make it outside of the USA. Films were nearly all American. The outward flight from London left at 21:15 which led to a sunrise some 4/5 hours later. During this dark period a dinner was served and when finished the cabin staff asked for all window shades to be closed and the cabin lighting was switched off. Fine for a few hours shut eye, but the cabin remained in darkness most of the daylight hours and was not lit until 2-3 hours before arrival in KL. Whilst I realise that many people would sleep my preference is to get into local times as soon as possible and would have preferred the cabin to be in the afternoon mode. During this enforced darkness the cabin crew were noticeable by their absence. Our return flight departure from Kuala Lumpur was delayed by 30 minutes but our arrival in Heathrow was 60 minutes late. At no point was any apology or explanation given by the flight crew. The delay caused great anxiety due to the need to catch onward transport. In the event I caught my coach with just two minutes to spare."

Despite this grievance the flight was smooth and most passengers had spare seats next to them as it was half empty. Entertainment including power points and well stocked magazine rack was excellent, food was decent for economy - I had chicken tikka and rice. The staff were nice but a bit lethargic and they looked sad, almost depressed - I can't blame them after all that has happened over last few years.

Before boarding the plane, the ground crew keep delaying the boarding by saying Business Class first, then family with small children, then row 17 to 30, then only reach my turn (I was seated at 7A). Once I board the plane, I can see the plane is old and dirty. The seat legroom is very small. There was no inflight entertainment. But I can praise check in staff and cabin crews.

This is our last flight with them. We flew return to Delhi. Our problem is their change to their Enrich Scheme which now requires more points than most airlines to redeem. Further, as Brisbane is no longer served we have to fly at our own expense to Sydney which substantially increases travel time. To be fair their cabin crew is still probably second to none. However you can note the subtle cost cutting. On the night flight from Delhi to Kuala Lumpur only a very thin ""blanket"" was provided. It did not even keep you warm. No amenities kit provided. Yet the following daytime flight to Australia provided not only the kit but a padded blanket and padded seat cover. Only one run of alcohol before lunch, no further alcohol was served or offered. No doubt the new management has its reasons."

Servings were on the small side, I thought. For red-eye flight, the A330 economy seats had enough padding to drift in and out of sleep, but I wouldn't describe them as comfortable. No amenities were provided unless you ask. The seats were perfectly adequate during the day flight.

Onboard the Boeing 737-800 business class was 4 rows of 2+2 and seats were comfortable and spacious enough for the 1 hour flight. It is disappointing there is no alcohol served on short flights, but their guava juice is very pleasant. Northbound catering was Malaysia Airlines famous satay, which was very good. Southbound we had an authentic Malay chicken curry. Crew were efficient and friendly. I will happily fly Malaysia Airlines again, subject to price.

Then finally one was dumped as if to say something. Meal service ran out of chicken so had to endure a fish option. No worries. Second GT took 30 minutes. Came with no ice and a dash of tonic. After clearances the crew was not to be seen. Passengers were walking to the back galley for self service. I just wanted a glass of water after 3 hours of non existence service.

I chose to fly with Malaysia Airlines because of the fares and availability. Overall the experience was positive. The check-in process was smooth and the seats in the upper deck of the A380 were perfectly comfortable, and the entertainment system adequate. On the upper deck it is worth requesting a window seat for the storage bin alone - all your requisites can be kept within easy reach for the duration of the flight. The food was better than I expected. The one major criticism I have is that on the Heathrow - KL leg (A380) at least one toilet was out of action, leading to queues. Those working were pretty disgusting, but that is down to the passengers causing the mess. I returned from Melbourne (A330 and A380 respectively), and on the A380 leg the plane had a total of just 79 passengers and 21 crew, allowing those of us in economy to create a bed from 4 empty seats. The airline must have made a huge loss on this flight. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful, even finding me and remembering my name and vegetarian meal request when I moved seats (if fact I moved from the upper deck to the lower one). Whilst I would probably still choose to fly one of the other carriers on this route (especially Singapore Airlines) in preference, I would have no problems returning to Malaysia Airlines if the fares and/or flight times were attractive."

Although we had booked the 2 middle seats we were allocated 2 on the side with the result that the person sleeping in the aisle seat had to be woken and adjust the seat to allow the window seat passenger access to the aisle.

What food I chose to eat was fine. And the seats (2x2) are wide and comfortable with TV screens. I would be happy in these seats for 3-4 hours. A good pitch and well worth the money.

Dessert was a slice of mango cheese cake which was stock standard fare as compared to the excellent red velvet cake served on the ADL - KUL leg.

The only saving grace was that on the journey to Sri Lanka from KL we were placed on a Sri Lankan airlines flight which was the opposite experience to Malaysian. 2 suitcases left in KL on the return journey to Sydney just topped off a more than mediocre performance.

Food disgraceful even by airline standards, served curry for breakfast at 9am on departing flight, only presume it was the curry from what should have been the original evening departure. Departed Sri Lanka at 1am and served curry at 2am followed by a frozen egg roll at 7pm just before arriving at Sydney, absolutely zero thought given catering, I have never seen so many food trays returned untouched. Water pretty much non-existent on all legs of the journey unless of course you wanted to walk to the galley and help yourself. Aircraft in very poor condition, seat covers coming off, entertainment units not working, tape holding things together in the bathrooms, not cleaned at all during any of the flights. Put simply, a number of major errors and a whole load of small things have contributed to our party of 11 people declaring that Malaysia Airlines are completely rejected from our future travels and as a group we travel internationally multiple times year both for holidays and work.

Perception is that Malaysia Airlines isn't interested in maintaining their business clients.

My suitcase didn't arrive because it was supposedly checked through to Mumbai. So I had to shop for more clothes and needed to pay for 2 more meals. During this time I phoned both numbers of lost baggage dept multiple times and there was never a reply to either line. Finally the hotel managed to get through and were told my bag was ready to board connecting flight to Mumbai. Upon arrival, (one hour late) into Mumbai, my baggage did not show. One hour later, I had to fill in another lost baggage claim and consequently waited 3 more days without my bag. During this time I could not get through to anyone on the lost baggage line and was never contacted about my bag. Finally, an Indian lawyer friend called the airline on a different line and proceded to tell them how disgusted we all were with the lack of service and care. The bag was found sitting in KL with an excuse that it was my fault that I filled out two lost baggage claims! There has at no time, been any contact to me, let alone an apology or offer to compensate for expenses incured during this time. I am appalled at the low level of service from this airline and all the many people I was in contact with during my travel to an international event are also shaking their heads. I never want to fly this airline again. I will pay more to travel on a more reputable airline."

The inflight entertainment was great on the 5 hour flight from Perth to Kuala Lumpur, then on the 14 hour flight to London it was very limited, none of the selection was available as the previous shorter flight, which surprised us on a bigger plane and longer flight. As we had two delays, we lost our connection to London, this was 2 days ago and still we have no luggage. if I travel to Australia again we would not fly Malaysia Airlines."

We only just made our connection, but our baggage didn't until 11pm that evening when it was finally delivered to our hotel. We were there at 10am! Apparently this is a regular occurrence. Too short a transfer time in Kuala Lumpur. One hot meal in 12 hours on the flight, and people with children were complaining. Our return flight was more friendly, but they ran out of section of meals. No fruit was offered. Not sure I would travel with them again by choice."

LHR to KUL flight departed more or less on time and was very full. I wouldn't recommend my seat (6D) front row of business class as there is very little storage space. The dinner service was quite rushed and seemed somewhat disorganised with crew dashing about trying to top up drinks etc. They appeared to be struggling to cope with a full cabin. The second meal service was better. My only real complaint on this sector was that the January movies hadn't been loaded (on 4/5 January) so there was exactly the same selection as in December which was a bit feeble. The KUL-CGK sector was fine apart from a new policy of no alcohol on board. An international flight in the evening in business class and couldn't even offer a glass of wine with dinner. Cost cutting indeed, Malaysia Airlines!"

It was such a small plane for international flight which takes 4hrs 55mins. And the space of the seat is the same as AirAsia budget airline. I felt so uncomfortable when I paid for more compare with budget airline. The cabin crew were not so helpful -  when I wanted to place my hand carry bag into the compartment and one of the cabin crew just stand there and didn't even help to find space for me. I have to remove the bags of blanket in the compartment and then have some space there. There was dirt around the seat and the armrest on my seat 29D was broken.

First aircraft (KIX-KUL) was rather old, service average. Got my wine after I'd finished my meal! Too many cabin announcements, each time in three languages. On the flight back (KUL-KIX) the seatbelt sign was on for most of the flight, so I couldn't get a coffee with my breakfast, and the breakfast was awful.

In January 2016, there are no more alcoholic beverages for a flight duration of less than 3 hours. The catering company should be terminated for their tasteless meals and inferior presentation. There are no more Salt and Pepper shakers - these have been missing since early 2015. On the KUL-DPS segment the serviette was given instead of linen! On the Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur flight the IFE was out. Look at the picture to witness the disappointing Business Class meal. The only saving grace for Malaysia Airlines are the cabin crew who are professional. From now on, I am going to try Malindo Air."

We were almost 3 hours delayed arriving into London although this was never mentioned by anyone, including the pilot, during the inflight announcements. Malaysia Airlines seems to operate a ""if you don't tell them it isn't happening"" policy. In addition to the delay, the service was terrible. IFE, yet again, had to be rebooted just after the system was started. The food was very poor. Clearly MAS is trying to get you to buy into their newest gimmick to buy ""upgraded"" economy meals. Our flight attendant was one of the rudest and least interested people I have met recently. One toilet was marked as unusable the entire flight, although the cabin crew didn't seem to have trouble using it. I don't know if the toilets were cleaned during the 15 hour flight. In London it took ages for the bags to arrive, and mine didn't (same as on the outbound). I had a 4 hour connection so that can't be the issue. After complaining about the previous flight I finally got an answer via email and was told delays are due to UK Air Traffic Control. Shame on you Malaysia Airlines for not taking responsibility."

I was brushed off by a number of ground staff when I asked about a delay as I was worried about missing our connection to Koh Samui (USM). Luckily the flight was held and we made it, but our luggage did not and we waited a day  until the bags arrived. It's clear that the food quality and cabin cleanliness have taken a hit due to cost cutting. The IFE also had to be reset 15 minutes after starting up despite this being a relatively new aircraft. It's sad to that on our flight the cabin crew were not caring, as they used to be some of the best."

The service wasn't bad but it wasn't especially friendly or personalised and there were no second offerings of anything. I did notice the satay service has been reduced to 3 sticks!

The aircraft condition was clean and well maintained. Just a little bit dirty on table tray and the sest pocket infront you. Cabin crew service was friendly and efficient. Ecnomy class wass almost full at that time. No inflight entertainment. They have a drop screen just for safety procedures video. Onboard food was good. I get an emergency seat so I get a roomy legroom. Just the main problem is the seat can't recline. But it's comfortable for me.

I requested a gin and tonic and it was provided, once again after the tray service was completed. The flight attendants were happy to provide this service when requested. Food was inedible. Offered was fish and rice or chicken and potatoes. Worst food I have ever been offered on a flight on board a full service airline. No wine offered with lunch. The state of the toilet can only be politely described as unhygienic. What was once a great airline seems to have lost its way since reverting to Government control and cost cutting management!

Let's start off with the seats. Old, run down and dirty. We did not dare to put our stuff inside that oily compartment. No IFE. It is unacceptable nowadays not to have IFE on international flights. Jakarta-KL flight arrival was delayed 3 hours due to bad weather forcing the plane to land in Johor for an hour. When we arrived at KLIA, it was 25 minutes before the scheduled flight to Auckland but the gate had already closed (lack of communication between ground staff and crew on the delayed flights). Ground Staff were woefully undermanned. It took us 2 hours to get a new boarding pass (for the day after), hotel and transports. KL-Auckland flight was slightly better, even though the toilet was run down, IFE was OK though a bit slow. The staff service was good. The return trip: Auckland - KL flight was delayed 2 hours due to previous flight delay and technical problem. This resulted in us missing the connection flight along with about 20 other people. IFE had some issues with non-functioning ""My Flight Info"" section. This time the ground staff did better, got the boarding pass, hotel and transport ready when we arrived. Our flight was scheduled at 8am with shuttle pickup at 6.20am. The shuttle was 30 minutes late, we ran in the airport to chase the flight, which we found out was cancelled. We ended up getting the next flight at 9am. The flight actually took off at 10am due to a crowded runway and cabin baggage issue.

However, the service on the Sydney-KL leg was dreadful with no eye contact from cabin crew and snappy responses to passengers around me. The food on the KL-Bangkok shorter regional flights was much better than the food on the longer Sydney-Kuala Lumpur and return flights, but that's not saying much. Some of the worst airline wine I have ever had, if you could get it, and in fact was not offered at all on the lunch-time flight between KL and Sydney. The exceptions to this dismal performance was one excellent flight attendant on the KL-Sydney leg who did the best she could and, given that I'm a One World Emerald passenger (Qantas Platinum), I had access to the Malaysia Airlines First Class Lounge in KL which was superb.

There were lots of staff in the lounge, but they were more intent on chatting to each other rather than on delivering customer service (except the very efficient crockery collector who whisked away everything the moment you put it on the table) but the crockery distributor wasn't equally efficient: at most of the self service distribution points, there were no glasses, plates or cutlery. This might have been a good thing as the food available looked tired and unapprtising, and below quality of the food available at the commercial outlets at the airport. The plane was clean and new, and the Business Class Seats spacious and still working. The cabin staff weren't particularly welcoming and failed to offer the assistance expected in Business Class. The food was of the same mediocre standard as in the lounge, and the food service delivery totally chaotic: my sister-in-law had to ask three times for a glass of water; I requested a glass of wine when my main course was delivered, and repeated the request a further two times, to have the wine delivered after my meal left-overs were cleared away. My wife had the presence of mind to look at the meals being delivered and requested ""just the fruit salad"" that she saw was being delivered to passengers in the other aisle (that aisle was being looked after by the senior steward and a friendly, efficient flight attendant). Fruit Salad she was informed was not available until the serving of the second course, but eventually another attendant asked why she wasn't eating and my wife repeated her request and was quickly served a bowl of the fruit salad. When the second course was served, my wife was presented with another bowl of the coveted fruit salad, along with all the other accompaniments which comprised the second course (none of which she wanted to eat). As I sipped my glass of wine, I was offered a basket of bread rolls which had been offered to the passengers in the other aisle at the start of the meal: I declined but assume that they were the most appertising part of the meal as passengers in the other aisle appeared to eat them.

They were attentive, and generally genuine with the service. On the LHR-KUL sector, I was very suprised by all the 3 crew that served the cabin addressed me by name, and remembered my name throughout the flight (perhaps due to the light load). I noted there had been some slight improvements to the food compared to my trip in September. However, cleanliness of the aircraft needs to be relooked into. The tray spotted coffee stains.

Onboard the service seems better and so does the food. The cabin staff are ever present and attentive. Our disappointment with Malaysia Airlines is that they have made detrimental changes to their rewards program, which they slipped through largely unannounced. It would have been a better decision to have been upfront and forthcoming about these changes - in the long term it may have bought them loyalty. A further disappointment is they have dropped many routes, including Brisbane which meant we had to travel to Sydney. This added around five hours to the journey. They have great and supportive cabin crew."

,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MEL to RGN via KUL,August 2015,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,2,no,1,"I recently flew Malaysia Airlines from Tasmania to Yangon and after the return flight was cancelled twice with no explanation, I was told at the airport that I would need to book the last leg of the trip myself as it was with a different airline, despite the flight being on the same ticket. I ended up buying another ticket based on this information, only to find out later that it wasn't my responsibility. Malaysia Airlines refused to reimburse me the money, and when I requested on occasions that my complaint be reviewed by a manager, they ignored my emails. There were quite a few other problems I had with them - including no vegetarian meal served on the flight despite having notified them of this requirement when I bought the ticket, misinformation and outright lies told to me by staff, complete confusion in some instances, and a refusal to reply to any correspondence. The customer service is ridiculously bad and I have no idea how they stay in business."

Sure the inflight entertainment could be better and the seats too, but the staff did their job and the flight was hassle free. The airline is struggling after two previous accidents and the impact these incidents have had on passenger numbers clearly showed on this flight. The plane was virtually empty so I was able to lie down in the middle 4-seat section. I hope the airline recovers and that passengers start flying with Malaysia Airlines again as they still remain a good quality airline."

Check in people only showed up 1 hour before. No information! Finally booked us in a hotel and told us with no other choice you are booked one day later. This is budget airline style! When they do not have enough passenger they move you on the next flight. For EU departure they have to pay 600 Euro beside the hotel. But Africa and others there is no consumer law practised. Therefore they take advantage and handle you like cargo.

I used the lounge in the satellite area which is ok but looks a bit run down now. Boarding through H8 so a train ride about 5min from the lounge. A smooth flight, breakfast tasted good. Drink runs made by a very chatty and nice crew. Malaysia Airlines offer a real business class on its smaller aircraft with 2-2 seat. Remote stand in HGK so a 10 min bus ride but once in the terminal immigration quick and bags waiting. Malaysia Airlines they still offer a decent product and I would use again."

For such a short flight, Malaysia Airlines surpassed my expectations. The business class was comfortable and the onboard staff are polite, even though they couldn't serve what we ordered (vegetarian meal). Maybe they can change the Baggage service allowance."

Bag drop very quick as was premium security and security lane, once airside used a 3rd party CIP lounge which was ok with some food and drinks available. Boarding from gate F5 was orderly and done by section and class. Seat on the Boeing 737-800 was roomy and comfortable. Flight departed on time and once in the air lunch was served which was pretty good, crew very pleasant with extra drinks offered. Flight arrived on time taking 1hr 50min. Bags off very quick so a good service."

Found the seats to be comfy and suitable but as with any economy seat you soon have the need to move! Good screen size, IFE movie choice was limited and all movies edited with swearing removed. This despite warnings and film rating prior to the film. Good food, best in a long time on an airline. Drink service was frequent, never thirsty. Cabin crew friendly and treated us like individuals. My partner was sick in the last 2 hours of the flight, one crew member stepped in and was fantastic, he did all he could to make the situation bearable. Return was better, economy very empty, moved from upstairs to main cabin downstairs with 3 seats to each passenger! "
,A330-300,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Kansai to Kuala Lumpur,July 2015,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,5,yes,8,"Upgraded to Malaysia Airlines Business-class by using the new bidding system, for a very reasonable fee. Seats were comfortable but the screen for IFE was oddly positioned, being lower than it should be and hence requiring you to slouch in the seat to get the best angle. Food was excellent, with the signature Satay accompanied by prawn, scallop and crab salad and a fillet of beef tenderloin. Service was friendly and helpful."

So the options of MH upgrade etc were not available to me, despite the fact that I wanted to do them. Why would an airline prevent its passengers from doing so, is unusual. I travelled AKL-KUL-BOM-KUL-AKL and the seatbelt sign was kept on for 75% of the trip. After 30 minutes or so, passengers just get up and move around opening overhead lockers etc, the staff stopping them. Was switched off 4 times at my request during this trip. Just does not make sense, they are using this as a crowd control measure. Unfortunately, this prevents the passengers from walking around and preventing DVT.  AKL-KUL basically fine, food poor to average. Old plane (777-200) and not refurbished. Transit in KUL of 1 hour and efficient. KUL-BOM plane clean and newish. Some seats do not recline. Was given this seat without being told about this issue - despite paying extra to get exit row seats. Poor customer service in my opinion.  Importantly when queried about the seatbelt issue the staff doesn't want to listen. Other airlines traveling similar distances encourage you to get up and walk around and this was completely absent here."
,,Business,Economy Class,Perth to Kuala Lumpur,October 2015,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,3.0,4,yes,7,"Malaysia Airlines from Perth to Kuala Lumpur. Check in was flawless. Flight was ok. Cabin crew seemed a bit uninterested, however they were attentive when called. Seats were comfortable, with plenty of legroom. IFE was ok. Food was a little disappointing. But it was good to be offered a beer before the meal. All in all it was a good flight with no unexpected surprises. I would fly with them again, no problem."
,A330,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne,September 2015,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,3.0,5,yes,8,"I got the upgrade to Malaysia Airlines business class via the bid for upgrade program with a small amount of money. The check in was smooth but the staff looked arrogant and tired, the baggage allowance for only 2 pieces of luggage doesn't make sense for business class customer. The lounge is clean and tidy, staff with smile on the face, food options are limited when considering this is the home base hub for Malaysia Airlines lounge. The staff on board are experienced, no complains about them. The meal were served shortly after leaving KUL. Satay was the highlight of the flight, with exceptional main meal and desert. The seat is not fully flat, but was comfortable enough for 4 hours sleep throughout the 7 hours flight. The immigration clearance was smooth with the express pass that was given by MAS."
,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Sydney to Paris via KUL,August 2015,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"After 18 years of flying with Malaysia Airlines, I have now given up and fly Singapore Airlines instead. A very bad experience indeed, with a very old (10-15 years?) dirty and noisy Boeing 777 instead of the A330  on which I booked, and which was withdrawn some 3-4 weeks before travelling. There were little inserts to make beds and the state of the seats was poor. The staff came to me to apologise for the state of the aircraft, but I will fly for a few hundred dollars more with Singapore Airlines. There was paper stuffed in the side of the washbasin in the plane as there was a big hole and staff informed me to please not remove it! Interior of plane looked very bad indeed. Airport lounge in Kuala Lumpur was a total disappointment, with food less than average and service non existent."

As we were KLM passengers on this flight operated by Malaysia Airlines, we were able to use the KLM lounge at Amsterdam. It was pleasant with a wide selection of food and drink, but very crowded. We had a stopover in Kuala Lumpur, and the airport check-in for our second leg was very smooth (as KLM passengers we couldn't check in for the MH flight online). The Malaysia Airlines lounge at Kuala Lumpur was fine, but the food selection was distributed all over the lounge so it was hard to know what was being offered. On both flights the business class seat did not recline flat, and on the Boeing 777 the inflight entertainment system was quite clunky. Kuala Lumpur really shines in its inflight service and the delicious food it offers. In both Kuala Lumpur and Melbourne our luggage appeared in good time. We were happy with our choice of airline."

She said she'll check, when she was the one who took the order. By the time she came back to me, the plane was descending and she offered me a bottle of water. Another steward was chatting with a passenger at 2F the whole trip, and there were less than 18 passengers total. My check-in luggage with 'Priority tag' came out last! How many chances do Malaysia Airlines need to compete with other low budget airlines?"
,A330 / A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MEL to LHR via KUL,September 2015,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,2.0,3,no,4,"I gave Malaysia Airlines the benefit of the doubt in choosing to fly them from Melbourne to London via Kuala Lumpur. Whilst they were not the cheapest option for this particular trip, I hoped the service I received would reaffirm my decision in booking with them. Timeliness doesn't seem to be a big issue. The crew in Melbourne weren't even at the aircraft by the time the flight was supposed to be boarding and the situation at KUL doesn't help with security being at the gate of the flight. The aircraft were perhaps the biggest let down with both the A330 and A380 interiors being dirty, damaged and looking in worse shape than they should be for their age. Seat cushions appeared to be coming off, there were broken lights at the exits, the pillow I was provided with was stained and PTV screens were dirty and had to be wiped down before they could be used. The food provided was some of the most disappointing I have been provided from an airline. "
,Boeing 737 / A330,Solo Leisure,Business Class,BKI to MEL via KUL,September 2015,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,5,yes,8,"I flew Kota Kinabalu to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur. This was my first experience of business class, and the angled lie-flat seats are not worthy of the distain I've seen heaped upon Malaysia Airlines. I found them comfortable enough and well worth the money, even on a relatively short overnight flight. The main meal was good and the second was more of a snack, but still ok. Although the range of recent releases on the IFE was limited, I found something to watch - and on both outward and return flights the flight attendants did not attempt to wrestle the earphones from me before I had finished watching, even though we were very close to landing. The service was fine: but what I really wanted to comment on was that when my first flight to KL was cancelled due to technical difficulties, the airline dealt with the flight reallocation very efficiently. International transfers were called to the counter very quickly and I was put on the next flight. I made the connecting flight - my luggage did not. However, the staff at Melbourne were extremely helpful. Within a few hours my suitcase was in Melbourne and the following day was delivered to my door - four hours drive from the city. Overall I think the airline deserves a better rap than it currently gets."
,A330 / Boeing 737,Business,Business Class,SYD to BLR via KUL,August 2015,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,5,yes,7,"Sydney to Bangalore via Kuala Lumpur, and I fly this route consistently with Malaysia Airlines mainly due to the good timetable and great pricing. The stopover is only 90 minutes. The A330 from Sydney has the angled seats, but they supply a seat cover with padding which helps make it pretty nice, and a good duvet as well. Obviously angled is not the best but it is fine for me and I won't pay way more just because of this. Food is pretty strong - the satay is a hit, mains are good, dessert is limited but ice cream is always an extra. IFE is great, decent range and always has worked OK for me. I find service to be above average - they are usually friendly and efficient and can't remember a bad experience. My only complaint is the second meal on this 8 hour flight is just too small and always the same (pie and salad) - call me greedy but I want two proper meals in business class on an 8 hour flight. Unfortunately the short haul business class product (KUL-DEL) is below average - they use a Boeing 737 for all flights to India now and it is too small for this sector and time of day. The leather seats are battered an uncomfortable. Food is up to standard, but since all the flights back from India are red-eye's the upright seats are simply not up to par. They used to fly a Boeing 777 from BOM to KUL which had the proper seats and was always full, but they have dropped it back to a Boeing 737 for the overnight flight now - if there was an airline with a better product with a timetable that worked I would probably switch as a result. Overall I recommend Malaysia Airlines and especially at the price - they are reliable and consistent with their product and once you get used to KLIA it is a decent place to transit. Service and food has always been good - they are not top tier by Asian standards but have a perfectly good product for the price and it is nice to have that option."

I had last flown with Malaysia Airlines in February 2015 in Business, and had a good if not outstanding experience. I was keen on seeing the new Malaysia Airlines and opted for MH with the MHUpgrade program and was happy to see my offer being accepted. But the new Malaysia Airlines was such a disappointment. They changed the equipment from Boeing 777 to Boeing 737 at the last minute. The aircraft was ancient, with business class seats which seemed straight out of the 90s so much for the new airline. Just one stewardess to cater to a full business class cabin, the menu choices and food presentation seemed like economy class in Singapore Airlines or Cathay Pacific. The quality of food was pathetic and I just ate the bread and left everything else. Of course the stewardess forgot to get my meal and drinks, and only remembered after I reminded her. The seats were so uncomfortable would rather have flown AirAsia and paid more for an exit row seat. If this is the new Malaysia Airlines then this is bang up job indeed. Never again will I subject myself to this torture."

However, the food served was below my expectation. If I am not mistaken the main course was called the seafood spaghetti, the sauce was quite bad and was too sour. The seat on the Boeing 737-800 was new, but the space where armrest areas where the table was placed was very dirty."

Our inbound flight was rescheduled, and one piece of luggage was lost. Our outbound flight to Kuala Lumpur was delayed 8 hours and our onward flight was delayed 24 hours.  All our luggage was missing on the return flight, and we were stuck in Kuala Lumpur 24 hours and Malaysia Airlines refused to provide adequate food. Just £3 towards our food. I had to spend about £200 covering delays. I raised a complaint and have heard nothing to date. "
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SIN to CDG via KUL,August 2015,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,2.0,2,no,7,"Many passengers Malaysia Airlines felt short changed when the route from Kuala Lumpur to Paris was changed from A380 to Boeing 777 since August 2015. If I had known it before purchasing the air ticket, I would have paid a little more to switch to other competitive carrier. I told myself give MH a chance to want to take their flight, although main aim is to cut costs at the expense of passenger comfort. I had a poor experience on a night flight from Paris to KUL, I asked for a packet of snack when I saw many on the pantry. The flight attendant disallowed me to take me to take one,  advising me they will go around to distribute. That snack came one and half hours later. Would it not be more polite and easier to just give me a packet - the snack is just 3 pieces of biscuits!"
,Boeing 777-200ER,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,PEN to CDG,September 2015,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,2,no,2,"We were supposed to fly Malaysia Airlines from Penang to Paris in an A380 until they decided to downgrade the plane last minute, and changed it to their ancient and dirty Boeing 777-200. Would like to change airlines at that time but it was too late and if we were to know they are using this aircraft we would not have chosen Malaysia Airlines. The Boeing 777 that we took for both flights were terribly old and seats were soiled and fatigued. The seat recline would require you to use some strength to push it down maybe due to the stiffness of the gears. Some of the seat fabrics were faded or torn. For sleeping, we were given an old pillow with an extremely thin  blanket that didn't help provide much comfort for the entire trip. IFE is a serious joke. It still use an ultra low resolution 7 inch LCD screen remnant of the 1990s that can barely display a good movie decently without straining your eyes. It's much better to watch with our iPad or phone as was really a horrible experience to watch with their IFE. The movies were not updated although it's stated in the September movie catalogue. It was still showing old movies from the previous month. Food in Malaysia Airlines used to be great compared to many other airlines. Now I would say it's a step below other lower rated airlines. Meal portions are smaller with lower value food servings. Choices for drinks, both alcohol and non alcoholic, were limited compared to years ago. In between snack for a long haul flight from KUL to CDG is a packet of peanuts and tasteless pizza sticks. We saw many passengers just left it there and opted for their own food instead. When it comes to the cabin staff, there is nothing much to really fancy upon, even though Malaysia Airlines has always promoted their excellent cabin crew service. The service is okay for an Asian airline but there is nothing worth commending. We weren't expecting first or business class service from them, but it seems that with a mediocre service, there was nothing much to shine for this airline. Malaysia Airlines has changed a lot in recent years and sadly it's not for the better. Poor management, inability to stay in the latest trends and lack of motivation from their staff has certainly taken its toll on this airline. Once a great and favourite airline of Asia has now totally lost its touch. Would not recommend it for long haul if it's their Boeing 777s."

Extremely disappointed. Seat was narrow and pretty uncomfortable to sleep in. I kept getting up because of the poor seat angle. IFE system is a relic from the '90s. Poor movie selection. Food wasn't great compared to what was served before. Clearly flying their ancient Boeing 777-200 is a downgrade (a rather severe one) from the A380 they had serving this route up to early Aug 2015. I've been a loyal customer to Malaysia Airlines for 2 years now, since I moved to Asia. They've been very patchy with service, baggage handling, unpleasant ground staff sometimes, some rather dated planes. But I stuck with them because of their A380 service to Paris. Now this is no more, I'm ditching Malaysia Airlines and moving to Thai Airways. They have proper flatbeds and a better IFE system. No reason to fly Malaysia Airlines any more."

I left at 8am and went back to the airport where my flight was due to leave at 10:20 that night. I have a frequent flyer card (albeit a Blue card) and asked if I could sit in their lounge as I had 14 hours to wait for my flight. They informed me I was only flying economy and did not qualify to use their lounge. I would have thought they would look after loyal customers but this does not seem to be the case.

I have never seen a worse business class or worse business seat in the last 10 years. Food is still served with plastic lid on top which is clearly not business class standard. Small TV in armrest and limited movie choice. Crew were nice, but we could feel that nobody believes in MAS anymore. The Malaysia Airlines Business lounge în Kuala Lumpur is another issue."

The meals were brilliant, except one - they only had the fish left for lunch on my return flight, and I wouldn't recommend it. Otherwise, the satay, nasi lemak, and even the soba noodles were palatable, and on par with other airlines business class food. Cabin crew seemed very experienced, and were very pleasant. The ones on my return flight particularly were very attentive, with a good sense of humour. The only downside was the seat. I was lucky to have an empty seat next to me on both outbound and inbound flights, despite the former being full except for a couple seats. On both occasions I had booked a window seat, and since the A330 business class configuration was in a 2-2-2 layout, if the seat next to me were occupied, I would've needed to take a giant step over the person beside me to get to the aisle if he/she were sleeping. I found that a problem when flying the Kuala Lumpur to London route on Malaysia Airlines A380. However, unlike the A380, these seats are angle flat. The trade off for the flat most position was a steep incline. I found it terribly difficult and uncomfortable to sleep in this position as I kept sliding down the seat. However, on my return flight, I tried a different seat position which is way more comfortable for sleeping; the trick is to incline the backrest and footrest to the max and tilt the part where you sit on slightly back. It makes this sort of cradle, which allowed me to sleep really well for a third of the flight. It was a good experience flying with Malaysia Airlines."

Otherwise flights and service were good. Onboard service good and friendly, main meal excellent, limited wine and drinks, and no bar service on any flights, but this seems the way in economy cabins on most airlines these days. The 2nd meal snack service was poor, just a roll, filled with something soft. Also same product served on all four flights both domestic and international, they should look at catering menu for different service. Seat pitch good on international flight, movies mostly older classics but oaky, have inseat USB in economy which is great. Overall value for money, and staff try hard to make your trip a good one. Checkin at KL, all flights check in at any MAS desk, so most times a long queue, but it moves quickly. Good trip."

Check-in at both BOM and SEL was a breeze (BOM-KUL was about 30% load, hardly any line) and baggage arrived in good time on the belt at both ends. Cabin service was excellent, the crew were on their feet, quickly responding to requests and usually quite friendly. All special meals arrived as requested on all legs. On the flip side, the catering from KUL was wanting (foreign particle in the salad, bread half crusty, half soggy) and some of the aircraft had seen better days. A toilet door would not shut easily and amenities were sparse. I am told the 777-200 will cease flying to BOM shortly. Somewhat annoying was their practice of leaving the ""fasten seat belt"" sign on for hours at a stretch even when the flight seemed quite smooth - inexplicably they did not disallow passenger movement in the cabin and use of toilets even with the sign on, but refused to serve hot beverages for the entire duration."
,A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to London,August 2015,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,4,yes,9,"Had the best two flight attendants ever on MH4, they did the job properly and with a smile. Sat upstairs on a day flight in economy and had a good flight experience. Well done to the two guys who worked there socks off going the extra mile for the passengers in the full section of the plane."
,Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,KUL to AMS,August 2015,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,1,no,2,"Worst seat I have had in business class over last 30 years of regular travel. The cushion was so thin and worn, you could feel the metal of the frame digging into you. There is a large wedge cushion that is to be used when you lower the seat into an angled bed, so I sat on this cushion when not lying down. But then when lying down the metal frame was very noticeable again when using the cushion at your feet. For the price it was a disgrace in term of comfort. They say the worst business class is better than any economy, but I have to say this came close, I'm sure some good airlines economy would have been as comfortable. I know Malaysia Airlines are looking to change, but they need to, I felt robbed in terms of value for money."
,,Business,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Sydney,August 2015,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3,no,2,"I thought I would fly Malaysia Airlines to support them given their current woes. Rewarded with a lost bag. I didn't have anything for a couple of days, but worse was no one from the airline contacted me to offer any assistance. I did have a phone number for their baggage department, but like every other airline that loses a bag, none of their team answered the phone. They do send you SMS messages, but they provide very little information that you can verify with anyone. The plane was tired, with two toilets in need of repair. On the way back to Sydney, I was staggered by the time taken to check in. Their systems for check in are very, very slow. The plane was a tired one, not clean, and one toilet wasn't flushing. Crew was ok, but they wake you to serve breakfast, which is a bread roll with cheese in it! Hardly worth waking for. I understand why they are in administration."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Taipei via KUL,August 2015,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,2,no,1,"I took Malaysia Airlines flight from Taipei to Amsterdam. The attitude of flight attendants was not nice. One of them was so impatient when passengers asked for a cup of water. Besides, my luggage was delayed for a day. And on 28 August I came back from Amsterdam to Taipei. Due to technical problems, the flight was delayed at Schipol Airport for three hours. So when we arrived at Kuala Lumpur Airport, many passengers missed their original flights. We waited for another three more hours for lining up to get new boarding pass. The ground staff arranged me to China Airlines since there was no flight to Taipei by Malaysia Airlines on that day. When I got to the gate of China Airlines, I was not allowed to board. They told me they didn't get any information from Malaysia Airlines and I was not on the list. Then I went to ask the ground staff of Malaysia Airlines. She called China Airlines to confirm the situation. After the call, she told me I should be ok to board - she didn't know the reason why China Airlines couldn't let me get in.  Then she arranged the flight for me next day and hotel in the airport for a night. She didn't try to communicate with the staff of China Airlines. Malaysia Airlines attitude is awful. "
,Boeing 737 & A330,Family Leisure,Business Class,Ho Chi Minh City to Delhi via KL,February 2015,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,5,yes,9,"Flew Saigon-KL-New Delhi and return. Check-in either side was smooth and hassle free. They offered a wide variety of drinks on board. KL-Delhi-KL has flat bed seats, very comfortable and cozy. Airport lounge at KL and Delhi offered great service and a rich food and drinks menu. IFE was decent. Cabin crew energetic and friendly. They could add more items to the list of vegetarian food. Fare is very competitive. Will fly them next time."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"London Heathrow to Perth, Australia via KL",August 2015,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,2,"The initial flight was an hour late taking off. When I arrived in Perth my luggage had been left in KL I was not reunited with my luggage until 25 hours later. On my return the flight I was delayed 5.5 hours, therefore I missed my coach to take me home. At no point was there explanation or apology."
,A380-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to Kuantan via KUL,June 2015,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,3.0,4,yes,5,"Flew with my wife and 3 kids. Having flown the A380 on EK, QR and QF, was really looking forward to flying the Malaysian version. However on entering the aircraft was disappointed to see a shabby and worn interior. The service was mechanical and the food was uninspiring. If you are flying this airline, do not expect any of the extra trimmings such as toys for the kids or amenity kits as it has all become very basic in view of their financial troubles. The IFE was acceptable, the state of the toilets were not. The flight was a couple of hours late taking off and we missed our connection to Kuantan. On the positive side this was handled quite well and we were put on the next flight with minimal hassle."
,A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to London,August 2015,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,2.0,3,yes,7,"Check in at KLIA very slow, you have to check in on the kiosk first then line up in a massive queue to drop your bags. The plane was scheduled to leave at 23:15 but didnt leave until 01:00, many travellers were scattered from their companions. I was among the unlucky, and I counted at least 3 couples in my seating area that had been seperated from their companions. However stewardesses were very helpful and did all they could to sort this out. After take off, drinks and peanuts were served, followed by a nice hot meal. Drinks were regularly served throughout the flight. Entertainment was good with new films and many good classics. We landed a little under an hour late and disembarkation was swift. Overall it was alright and I would recommend Malaysia Airlines."
,A330,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Kuala Lumpur to Sydney,August 2015,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1,no,1,"My experience today was the worst I have had on an airline for a very long time. Staff sloppy and work shy. Food was uneatable, toilets disgusting with water on floor and no hand towels. Seat very uncomfortable, inflight entertainment system turned on for whole flight, but headphones distributed 30 minutes after take off and collected an hour before arrival. I was shocked to see the plane land with several window shades down and many seats in a recline position. The staff spent the last hour of the flight packing everything away and not doing pre landing checks. The Golden Lounge in Kuala Lumpur is worn out and dirty."
,Airbus 380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to Bali via Kula Lumpur,August 2015,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,2,no,2,"We traveled on Sunday 16 August, from LHR to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. At check in we were advised by Malysian staff that the flight was on time. However, when we got through security it was on the board as being delayed 2 hours. Then it was changed to a 18.30 take off instead of midday. No one made an announcement to say or any reason given as to why. Passengers were passed from one counter to another to try and find what was happening and what would happen about connection flights. Sadly none of this was addressed at LHR. Finally the flight took off at 18.50, 6 hours 50 mins later than scheduled. The plane was dirty, food left on seats, trays not wiped down, traces of drinks and food on them. No hot towels were given during the duration of the flight (13 hrs), or travels bags provided. Food was also very limited, we were given one hot meals during the first 2 hrs of the flight, then nothing else until 2hrs before landing. Drinks were brought round twice, with meals, but no one informed you that you could go to the galley and get drinks or snacks during the flight. The seats are very uncomfortable for the length of flight. Onboard entertainment is not very up to date. Not looking forward to my return trip to the UK."
,Boeing 777 200,Couple Leisure,Business Class,DPS to KUL,July 2015,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"Business Class DPS to KUL due to very good Malaysia Airlines experiences in the past years. Happy to say that they have kept it up and the Boeing 777 Business Class cabin is very roomy for a short 2½ hr flight plus very clean. The senior crew were great and the meals good. Very good ""old school"" experience with Malaysia Airlines. Keep up the great work!"
,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Singapore,August 2015,4.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"If I could rate the ground service even lower than 1 star, I would rate a negative. I do not intend to put all other staff off, when the terrible ones were only a few out of tens of thousands. But I was refused a check in service prior 50 minutes before departure with no check in baggage. What's more agonising is that the person before me was checking in to the same flight. The ground staff was in yellow suit sort of uniform believed to be an officer, an officer who is supposedly a role model to all told me in Bahasa Melayu that they would not check me in unless it's 40 minutes before the flight, I pointed at the clock and replied it is now more 50 minutes before the flight, he raised his voice and said  ""who do you think you are that we should check you in?"" Well my review is that if the morale and capability of staff members of this airline is as such, why bother settling for mediocrity"
,A380,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Dublin to Kuala Lumpur via London Heathrow,June 2015,1.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,3.0,3,no,6,"I flew business class Dublin to KL via London Heathrow. This review is for the London to KL on the A380. I was very happy with the outbound flight as the service was impeccable and I had the bonus of an aisle seat in the middle with no one beside me. The return journey was a different story. The cabin crew and food were remarkable and was up to the usual high standards. However the seating arrangement was far from ideal for the single traveller. I requested one of the middle aisle seats so that I won't have to climb over anyone and no one will be climbing over me to get out. None available and I got an aisle seat next to a window seat. The person sitting next to me certainly spoiled the trip. Twice when getting out of his seat and getting back in he hit my shin with his heel, ok it may be an accident but common courtesy would suggest saying sorry but not a word from this individual. Granted Malaysia Airlines is not responsible for this but their seating configuration does not consider single travellers who may want some privacy after forking out to fly business class. For this reason alone I will not choose Malaysia Airlines for my future travel if I am paying extra to fly business class. Such a pity as they have some of the best food and cabin crew in the airline industry."
,,Family Leisure,First Class,Auckland to London via Kuala lumpur,August 2015,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,4.0,3,no,4,"I travelled with my 20 month old son for which I paid for a separate seat. The cabin stewards were unhelpful, unfriendly and showed no interest whatsoever in me or my son. There was no children's food available. They would not allow me to put my child's antibiotics in the fridge. The steward on the first leg of the flight was rude and offhand. On the second flight staff gave the impression we were a nuisance. The food is generally of a poor standard and my child is not a fussy eater but the snacks were very unhealthy. The first flight from Auckland to KL had not been cleaned properly. Selection of children's TV was very limited."
,A380 & A330-300,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LON to BNE via KUL,July 2015,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,4.0,4,yes,6,"LON to KUL I had an upper deck exit row seat. The legroom was great, seat a bit hard after 13 hours. Service and food good, IFE average. KUL to BNE flight uneventful, food average at best - on time arrival."
,A330,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur,July 2015,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,4,yes,7,"Smooth check-in. The lounge was comfortable with a reasonable food and drink offering. The boarding process was very quick. Only juice and water were offered as a welcome drink, but a full range of beverages was available once underway. The seat was comfortable for a daytime flight, but there was not a lot of storage in-seat. The service was efficient but generally a bit distant. We were served a large lunch and a snack on the 8 hour flight, both fine. The flight operated on time and was a very good experience for the price."
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Brisbane to Milan,July 2015,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,3,yes,8,"The premium seats (front/exit rows standard economy class) are comfortable, only complaint is with the middle armrest, if we could have lifted them we would have had more room to be able to sleep. Unfortunately it houses the tables, so this was not possible. Food was lovely and there was enough, wecdidn't ask for anything further or felt hungry. Staff were lovely. Basic amenities given and the entertainment on offer was sufficient."

Mostly transit pax as informed by ground crew the flight is only around 30 passengers. IFE offered latest movie, and given that its a short flight only juices and nuts is provided. legroom tight but seat is comfortable."
,A380 / Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Heathrow to Darwin via Kuala lumpur,July 2015,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,5.0,4,yes,9,"I used this airline from Heathrow to Darwin return in July, both via KL. The service was on time for all flights, connection at KL easy, baggage transferred, so no worries there. The flight was comfortable and staff very polite and obliging. I had not noticed at booking to change the meals to vegetarian. However the staff on board had vegetarian food available and ground staff organised it for return flight. Plenty of films. Water and fruit juice was regularly brought round, so we were not dehydrated. I wondered why the window screens were kept down and lights dimmed for majority of the journey?  A young child passenger was near me on return journey and I noticed how attentive the staff were to help the parents. In all a faultless journey. Thank you - had the same good service with this airline 2 years ago. Will use again in the future."
,Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dhaka to Kuala Lumpur,July 2015,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,I was flying this flight by my enrich miles. It's a good journey. Cabin staff are very good. They don't say you no if they have for serve you. It's really good for airline service. On time take off and Landing.
,A330-300,Business,Economy Class,NRT to KUL,July 2015,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,5,yes,8,"Economy class on MH89. The last time I flown with them they used to have a peanut and drinks service before serving lunch. They have done away with the peanut round this. Hardware wise, the seats were comfortable and the IFE was okay. There was a choice between beef and seafood. I chose the seafood and it was quite good. Luckily they still have the refreshment service 2 hours prior to landing. Service wise, the cabin crew were courteous and friendly."
,Boeing 737,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Langkawi to Kuala Lumpur,July 2015,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,5,yes,9,"This was only a 40 mins flight but we had a delay, this was no worry for us because we had 6 hours connection, but one of us only had and hour so it was very tight to get food, the flight was not as good as on the way here but the flight was still good, it was busier and the cabin crew were still as nice, they served us one drink round and dates and peanuts, they also gave us blankets if needed. I recommend Malaysia airlines."
,,Business,Economy Class,Adelaide to Ho Chi Minh City via KUL,July 2015,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,4.0,4,no,6,"Courteous service, good leg room, average food (soggy roll). Four hour delay in Kuala Lumpur with no explanation until on the plane, this is not good enough, it is a common courtesy to communicate. I couldn't even find a place on their website to provide feedback."
,A330,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Kuala Lumpur,June 2015,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,4,yes,7,"Flew Perth - KL (return). Both flights were good, nothing remarkable or special. Seats were fine, legroom somewhat tight but there was good recline. Food was good by airline standards. IFE is a bit of a let down compared to Cathay - touchscreen was often unresponsive (although can be circumvent by using the remote), choice of movies was healthy, but limited - although there were some that did catch my eye. Cabin crew were courteous and professional except for one time where I noticed a cabin crew instructing a passenger on how to use infant seatbelts during the screening of the safety video. Other than that, I'm a satisfied customer."
,Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,DPS to KUL,July 2015,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,1.0,3,yes,6,"Can't fault the cabin crew, good service and tasty meals. Flew Business Class, was kept waiting with no communications at check in due to the ash cloud following an eruption nearby. Very poor service at airport, not treated like a premium passenger at all. Not 5 star!"
,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Beijing via Kuala Lumpur,July 2015,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,5,yes,7,"We flew from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur, then Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. On both legs we found the staff to be lovely and helpful. The food was plentiful and we enjoyed it (though we are not fussy like some). The inflight entertainment has heaps of choice between movies to games etc. I didn't go to my phone or book once. I recommend this airline, we received good service."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denpasar  to Kuala Lumpur,July 2015,3.0,3.0,,,,1.0,3,no,1,"In all the chaos at Bali Airport due to its 24-hours closure for the volcano, Malaysia Airlines didn't bother to open information desk for passengers who couldn't fly one day before. Terrible mess at check-in counters of passengers who missed 3 flights from Bali yesterday, with passengers leaving on time. Unprofessional and with ignoring guests comfort and convenience. Long queues and nil information for passengers."
,Boeing 777-200,Family Leisure,Business Class,Amsterdam to Singapore via Kuala Lumpur,June 2015,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,2,no,5,"Can I just remind Malaysian Airlines that when you become a member of One World your customers expect seamless recognition of points etc. The family are One World members with British Airways and decided to take a last minute school break to Amsterdam, 2nd June, MH16 and were accepted for MH upgrade at not a cheap offer. The crew were fabulous, aircraft had seen better days and seat was very poor. Return on MH 19, 10th June was exactly the same format. Now comes my gripe, no avios or tier points awarded and despite the best efforts of MH Upgrade team nobody from Enrich answers emails or picks up the phone. I really would expect better service and will think twice about using them again."
,A330,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Sydney to Kuala Lumpur,June 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,10,"Initially booked flight in economy at a great price and was invited to bid for an upgrade to business which I did and was accepted (overall price bid for this seat was exceptional). Given priority at Sydney airport check-in/immigration and access to the business lounge which was a lovely touch. Business class seats were roomy and very comfortable. Staff were pleasant, nothing was any trouble and food was really tasty (Nasi Lemak and gorgeous Malaysian chicken/beef skewers later in the trip before landing). If MAS can maintain this standard, they are on a winner. A very enjoyable flight."
,A333 and B772,Business,Economy Class,CAN to AMS via KUL,June 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,"CAN-KUL-AMS on return business trip recently, on a very low price. The service was very good in all flights. Cabin crew are very friendly, attentive and efficient. During the long-haul fight, cabin crew keep the passenger hydrated by serving beverages. KUL-AMS on Boeing 777-200, legroom was very large, seat was comfortable yet old, but IFE display very poor (content are rich). CAN-KUL A330-300 legroom was ok, IFE very good, seats new and comfortable. The food were also great, I would recommend the Nasi Lemak. Check-in was efficient. Great to see that the cabin was quite full in all lags. "
,A330-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Adelaide to Kuala Lumpur,June 2015,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,8,"Quick and speedy checking at Adelaide airport, access to the Qantas Lounge. Overall a great flight. Malaysia Airlines crew do a great job, the service was friendly and food excellent. IFE had a decent number of recent movies to pick from. Seat on the A330 is an angled flat bed not a lay flat, but for a daytime flight this isn't a issue."
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Adelaide to Hong Kong via KUL,June 2015,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,5.0,4,yes,9,"Reasonable legroom, and the food was quite good for economy, with adequate portions. Wine was okay. Entertainment system had good screen and plenty of choices. Cabin staff were polite and efficient. Baggage transfer between flights at KUL and final delivery at Hong Kong was also fine. A smooth, good value experience."
,A330-300 / Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Melbourne to Kansai International,June 2015,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4,yes,8,"Our first time on Malaysia Airlines and we boarded the day after all staff were given notice of dismissal, so we were a bit apprehensive about the likely mood on board. We should not have worried. Staff and service was excellent on our flight to Kuala Lumpur and through to Kansai on 4 June. Same good service for our flights back on 18 June. Food okay and plenty of it. Only complaint is the old style sloping seats which are a bit uncomfortable if you have experienced lie flat seats. Will use their service again if their flight schedule meets our needs."
,B737-800 / B777-200,Family Leisure,Business Class,SIN to HKG via KUL,May 2015,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,5.0,5,yes,8,"Had my MH upgrade approved! My outbound flight SIN-HKG via KUL was good, due to short connecting at KUL, only able to grab a short time in Satellite Golden Lounge.  KUL-HKG inflight service was nice, good selection of food/wine. Need improvement on IFE (old and bad headset). Ground staff was friendly, speedy check-in for Enrich Silver Member at dedicated counter at KLIA, priority boarding was announced too. FA are friendly and smile, addressed me by name and chatty. Seat was so so, a bit hard and not reclining to a proper flat bed. Inbound HKG-KUL was fine at first, boarded aircraft but  delayed 1hr and then delayed another hour due to techincal problem. Hence I missed my connecting flight KUL-SIN. Approached ground staff, requested to access to the Golden Lounge (I fly Economy class for my inbound leg) but got rejected, but was given meal vouchers to spend for dinner. I would fly again with Malaysia Airlines."
,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,TPE to JHB via KUL,January 2015,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,4,yes,7,"Malaysia Airlines need to control customer hand carry baggage, all of the overhead bin was full and the passenger next to me was sitting with all of their belongings (4 bags). The food quality and portion was acceptable and delicious. Seat is comfortable but the legroom was limited when the passenger in front reclines. The IFE can be better if Malaysia Airlines change their poor earphone."
,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Tawau,June 2015,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,3.0,4,yes,7,KUL-TWU domestic flight. I have not flew MAS for a long time due its expensive fare compared to Airasia in domestic routes. Certainly a plus point in this route is the availability of inflight entertainment and a new aircraft type of B737-800. The downside was the meal. The quantity was small and was not as tasty. I would fly MAS only if the price is competitive.
,777-200 and 380,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Auckland to London via Kuala Lumpur,June 2015,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,4.0,5,yes,10,"I have been a Malaysia Airlines loyal customer for many years and slowly I have seen their decline over the last 5 years or so but they have turned themselves around. The service, food and wine was the best from Auckland to K.L, and both my wife and I were really impressed. On the flight from K.L I slept most of the way but every one was friendly and great comfort in the big 380, spotlessly clean and a great flight. So impressed that this airline is on its way again to one of the best, good on them."
,A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SIN-KUL and KUL-LHR,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,no,7,"SIN-KUL on MH602 and KUL-LHR on MH4, the first flight left on time, staff were very friendly and attentive and the aircraft was in excellent condition, but there was a 4 hour delay on MH4. They offered us a free meal voucher and we left on scheduled time at 14:00. The A380 is excellent and super-comfortable even in economy class,  staff were nice and the food was good as well, we've had two full meals and one snack on 13hrs flight. However, because of the delay and the few other delayed and cancelled flights I've seen at the airport I wouldn't fly with them again. "
,Airbus A380,Couple Leisure,Business Class,CDG-KUL,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,"We travelled MH21, CDG-KUL, June 6 on A380. The difference compared with our previous experience was fantastic and we have travelled Malaysian extensively over the past 12 years. Staff were happy and friendly, service was great, food the best I had had on an aircraft in a long time. Great work MAS, I hope the trend continues. Onward flight on MH135, KUL-BNE was also good but the business class seats on the A330 are a poor product comfort wise and need to be replaced."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,MH 003 MH 004. Travelled LHR-KUL May 19th and returned May 27th in Economy. Very satisfied. All aspects were very good.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,KUL to Manila. MH705 11 May. Cabin crew were friendly and polite. Seat was clean and neat. Announcements clear and landing was on time.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,,,3,no,3,9/5 MH142 Sydney-KL. 24/5 MH141 KL-Sydney. Malaysia Airlines used to be very good but this is no longer the case. On a return flight Sydney-KL-Sydney service was perfunctory verging on rude. The meals (a brunch and a small snack during an 8 hours flight!) were poor (barely edible and very little choice) and drinks were offered grudgingly. No wonder they have trouble filling-up their flights. We will definitely give them a miss in future.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,5,yes,9,PEN-KUL-PEN. Booked Malaysia Airlines through travel agency at a low price. I was surprised by the generous leg room offered by MAS and it is wider than any widebody jet operated by Cathay Thai Dragonair etc. However on the first leg the cabin required more attention some food stains from earlier flights were left. The entertainment system works fine but on the return flight the IFE failed abruptly after both engines started. Other than that the cabin crew seemed disinterested in serving passengers on Penang to KL route while crew members on my returning flight were much friendlier. Overall the airline product was good.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,15 May 2015 KUL-SBW Boeing 737-800. Overall great experience flying with Malaysia Airlines. Fast check-in and helpful check-in staff. Reasonable selection of food and beverages in the Domestic Golden Lounge. Friendly and attentive lounge staff. Boarding was smooth. Quite lucky though to board the B737-800 with Boeing Sky Interior and personal AVOD. Left ahead schedule. Cabin crew were friendly and professional. The meals were nice although have some space for improvement. Would like to fly with Malaysia Airlines again in near future.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,no,5,Left on time. 2 seats next to window which is better than better than 3 for couples. Cabin crew rushing around and not all that pleasant to deal with. They seemed to not enjoy their job all that much. Inflight entertainment system a disaster. One reason being the 777 was old and so to were the screens. No real complaints just up the cabin crew inflight service and get new planes. Awful time to leave at 12.05 midnight. If flying to Thailand as we were take Thai direct it is worth the extra cost.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,"Melbourne to KL return. The 777-200 is an older plane. I have flown economy on it and while it did the trick I was helped then by the fact that the plane was about 60% full so had two seats to myself. In business I was hoping for a much better experience. I'm a broad fella (and carry a few pounds) and found the seats a bit narrow. They reclined fairly well but the sleeping position was on an angle. Even with the foot stop folded out at the bottom I found myself waking up after having slid down the chair a bit and had to readjust. Satay at the start are nice the meals were a little ordinary. Cabin were friendly and attentive. Entertainment / movies were perfectly fine though there are better ones about with different airlines. The fold out TV and awkwardly positioned tray table head phone jack and power outlet are a sign of the old business class seat design more than anything else. In the end it is ""ok"" and I suspect that business on the A380 would be much better due to newer seats. I am convinced that the catering companies in KL (departure point) are not too flash as the standard of food on all my inbound flights in the past (including this occasion) has been better than my outbound flight. While I could happily fly it again I wouldn't want to save up and fly the 777-200 in business all the way to Europe and back. Melb to KL would be fine though."
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,no,3,Brisbane - Kuala Lumpur flight MH134 May 1st. Seven hours night flight in a very uncomfortable seat that does not lie flat and let you slide down. Very uncomfortable. Shall avoid any night flight on this airline if possible.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,"MH19 AMS-KUL 27/03. MH141 KUL-SYD 28/03. MH122 SYD-KUL 10/04. MH16 KUL-AMS 10/04. AMS-KUL-SYD-KUL-AMS in Y. One word: dreadful. Persistent delays on 3/4 sectors. Service onboard is below standard. Toilet supplies are never replenished on any sector. Complaints get a standard ""don't care"" response. Poor communication from baggage handling staff. Delayed luggage process is an utter shambles. In-flight entertainment has limited options. On the first leg the attendant left hot chilli pretzels for my two young children giggled and walked off. I went to change the packs for a different flavour and was rudely told that it's only one per passenger. On the second leg to SYD the attendant brought my children's food out. The attendant confirmed that these were child meals - when I opened it I found it was a spicy dish. I brought this to the attendants attention and asked if they could fetch the child meal that we requested. He stormed over to the people behind us snatched the food from in front of the children and dumped the food in front of my kids telling the people behind me in a very loud voice that I changed my mind. The return service was very similar. Departure out of KL was delayed an hour. If you need the toilet best to go in the early part of the flight as the toilet supplies are never replenished on all four sectors. Arrived in Sydney and with the delay in AMS meant my luggage was left in KUL. My luggage arrived the next evening. The air fares on MH are not the most competitive. If you can go with a competing airline for a similar price or slightly more go with that option rather than MH."
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,no,5,I flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur then onto Melbourne I was a little disappointed with the flights the seat on the flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was the worst ever I ended up with a really sore back. There was not much of a selection for TV entertainment. The service was good and I enjoyed the satay the most. The cabins could do with a really good clean. I would not use them again unless I hear that the seats have improved.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,1,no,2,I did a return trip from Sydney to London via KL. The SYD-KL flight arrived half an hour early for some reason just making the stopover longer. The KL-London flight was an hour late. This meant I missed my connection and had to sit in Heathrow for 7 MORE hours. The return London-KL was once again delayed meaning another stuffed up connecting flight. The customer service was appalling no member of staff on the planes ever smiled at me. All of the food was inedible (both in economy and business) except the satay. The only decent thing about this experience was the comfort of the A380 seating although the Qantas one I have flown was superior in more ways than one. Last time I'm flying Malaysian considering how much extra it cost me in rebooked flights and how poor the overall experience was.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,2,no,2,Just back from a trip from Sydney to Vietnam via K.L. At 194 cms tall I always try for an exit or aisle seat. In Sydney outbound I was first in the Online check in 3 hours before take off only to be told that the plane was full and that I was stuck with the seat I had been allocated which turned out to be in the middle of a 4 seat section. It was an A300 plane and very uncomfortable. In K.L I approached the transfer desk and was assured that I now had an exit seat to Saigon. It turned out to be a very tight window seat nowhere near the exit. On coming back from Hanoi again first in line at check in I was again assured that I had exit seats on both planes to Sydney. Again the Hanoi flight turned out to be a tight window seat nowhere near the exit. Approached the transfer desk in K.L again to be told no exit or aisle seats available except the youngish lady next to this fellow interrupted to point out that there was an aisle seat available and then proceeded to give it to me. Why is it that this is a blatant load of lies? Prior to this I've flown with Malaysia a number of times and always had good service but this experience coupled with very poor seating on the A300 planes has now put me right off.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,9,SYD-KUL B777. Malaysia Airlines is great in the air but crook on the ground. Staff at MH offices in SYD and DEL seem to treat pax as a burden. Queuing times at SYD were long. Inflight service is fantastic. Fares have gone up and TG and SQ are cheaper. MH is great airline with inconsistent service on the ground. I will definitely fly MH and ask friends and family to fly MH in preference to others. But the airline needs to shape up ground services. Also the economy seats on the 777 are narrow compared to those on Emirates 777s. Their planes crew service KLIA is superb. Just fix those loose ends.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,DPS-KUL v. v. Flew on Christmas eve 2014. For first leg (DPS-KUL) there was no IFE in every seat. The plane was bit old but the cabin crews provided nice service. I got late dinner and for me the taste was good. Second leg (KUL-DPS) the plane was newer and they provided better IFE. still got nice service from the cabin crew but the meals that they served was so so. But overall this airline is nice and I would not mind flying with MAS again.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,2,no,4,Only positive things I can say is the seat on the Airbus 380 was one of the most comfortable I have used and the satay was lovely. From Heathrow seat very comfy and the satay was very nice but make sure you have 2 or 3 serves as the rest of the food was inedible certainly not up to the standard of other (cheaper) business class meals I have eaten. Chef on call as advertised by them was not available and to order the meals you had to call would have been ok but I had 2 numbers and each number was a message that told me to call the other number. IFE and service moderate have had much better. Late into KL so was herded straight onto next flight to Sydney (Airbus 330-300) seats were very uncomfortable so slanted I kept falling down them no way to get comfortable at all I had an angled seat on a much cheaper airline and it was much more comfortable that this one it was just slanted so legs ached no matter what position it was put in. Again meal inedible and sandwiches (breakfast) given post landing were minuscule and service was less than adequate.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,HKG-KUL-JHB in 777-200ER and old 737-800. Very comfort seat with large seat width and legroom for 772 but the seat width for old 738 quite disappointed. Small and old PTV in 772 but the amount of selection of programmes are the same as other medium-haul flights in modern aircraft's. Food served was delicious but the side dishes and beverages was just moderate. Excellent staff service in both flights. I would recommend 772 but not recommend old 738 on medium-haul flight.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew KUL-KIX (26/3) KIX-KUL (2/4). Successfully upgraded to business via plusgrade. All in all very pleasant experience considering the very small amount I paid for the business seats. Staff were very courteous and polite always addressing me by name and attended to my needs very quickly. Flight supervisor of the KUL-KIX was a very senior male steward. Very professional and casual at the same time. He would engage in informal conversations from time to time - nice personal touch. Food was standard business class meals. Satay as always was tiptop. The only down side I felt was the fact that there was no amenities kit provided for a medium-haul flight.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,3,no,3,Flew Sydney to KL on 19th March in business class and it was very average. The food was a big disappointment with only about 10 of us in the cabin and one of the 3 choices had gone before they were half way through the service. The cabin was grubby and when we lifted the tray table for dinner there were hairs and old food in the cavity where the tray was stored. The crew were pleasant enough but no one stood out for service with a smile! We try and fly Air New Zealand when possible as they are slick and definitely worth the price. Come on Malaysian clean up your act!
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,PER-KUL-NRT on A333. Service good flights on time food OK. IFE had a good selection though it did need a reboot on the first flight. Aircraft new and very clean seat not so comfortable though noticed this especially on the 2nd red-eye flight.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,"Flew from Manila to Paris via Kuala Lumpur round trip. Flights were generally on time and slight delays were due to airport issues and not the aircraft itself. Sat in the front part of business class on the A380 (row 7&8) and seats were quite comfortable. The controls worked well and only comment I have is on flat mode it might not fit someone in excess of 6 feel tall (I'm 5""11). The bathrooms at the front of the 380 were the biggest I've seen on an airplane and was generally clean the whole trip. There were some cracks (covered by tape) and spills (cleaned up by not so nice looking rags) at the galley which I think MAS needs to repair. Food was good. Satay was great (even had a second serving) but the rest was standard business class food. They ran out of some spirits because they only used baby bottles instead of a proper large bottle. Staff were courteous as they always called you by your name and acted fairly quick to requests. They were quite engaging during lean periods of work which was actually nice. Just a minor comment. Overall MAS was a very pleasant experience for me and wouldn't mind riding on it again and recommending it to friends colleagues and family."
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,JHB-KUL-CAN in new 737-800 and A330-300. Good legroom seats and offer high quality and sensitive touch screen PTV in every seats. The food served was excellence but the juices and coffee were just moderate. Various selection in IFE system except some categories. Staff service is better in domestic flight. Definitely Malaysia Airlines will be my first choice for flying.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,SYD-KUL return Airbus A330-300. Both flights were on time. Planes were clean seats comfortable excellent IFE. The service was wonderful especially from SYD to KUL. Food was good alcoholic drinks were available. Fantastic value for money. Highly recommended.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew from Brisbane to KL then Bangkok 3rd March Red Eye. First flight was great plane was clean and food was great. TV staff were so polite I was having a few vodkas and the staff actually came to see if I was ready for another drink they couldn't do enough. 2nd flight - plane a lot older staff not as polite but good flight. Returned 18th and 19th March - Staff were great on both flights food was great had no problems at all.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Flew economy class from LHR-KUL return. Flying on the 18th March and inbound 26th on A380. No foot rests no hot towels and only two meals offered on such long flights. Packet snacks were available from the galley however. Drink runs were made and IFE was good but navigation could have been better. Noticed on the flight map that we avoided all of Ukraine taking a slightly longer route hence a little late into KUL.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,KUL-PEN Economy class on Boeing 737-800 Boeing Sky Interior. Smooth boarding attentive cabin crew AVOD in every seat. Peanuts and beverages provided on this short 40 mins flight. Comfort seat and legroom was fine for a short flight. Price was a bit higher than normal due to Chinese New Year Eve as most Chinese were going back home to celebrate.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,Flew MH16 KUL-AMS on March 21 Seat 03J and subsequently MH19 on March 28 Seat 02C. Good experience with the inflight supervisors and the selection of food and presentation. Attentive and always with a smile. The amenities kit were good but the sock not usable beyond 1-flight. The IFE was ok with not many choices of latest movies. Headset provided were faulty but exchanged upon request (MH19).
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew one leg Business class KL - Melbourne. Early Jan 2015. Had 5 hours to wander in the airport and went between both Business lounges and the shops. I think the airport is the best in the world for passengers. I agree the lounges are crowded but so are all lounges these days. I loved the lounges! Food was fantastic in them but more so onboard and always was in Economy as well. Service was one of the best and although bed could of been more comfortable it was a great flight.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,BNE-KUL-BNE Feb 2015 - Business via MH upgrade bid. I fly a lot this is my first time flying long-haul Business. The Qantas Lounge (shared by MH) in BNE is excellent. The MH Golden Lounge at KLIA albeit spacious is overcrowded the service is mediocre largely due to unstable Wi-Fi connection and chaotic service at the barista station. The in-flight experience both ways is the best I have had. The cabin crew were very attentive and friendly they addressed me by my name. The signature satay's reputation is well-earned and the three-course meals I had on both flights were well-refined. Hot towels offered multiple times throughout the flight is a nice touch. Great IFE selection and the reclinable seat was very comfortable I slept very well.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,MH 019 AMS to KUL 5 March 2015 Business class. The airplane was spotless and the crew welcoming and kind. The service was excellent and the food very tasty. The seat was comfortable enough for me to get 9 hours sleep on a 12+ hour flight. It was most enjoyable.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,no,4,The airline is a mix of good poor and very bad. The first problem was booking vegetarian meals it can be missed if booking online and no way of changing online once booked. Had to phone twice to get it sorted the website quotes a number in Malaysia to phone found a UK number that redirects and considering I was on hold for 30 minutes thank goodness I did! The first flight (LHR-KUL) was excellent got seats in upper deck and was less half full ample drink runs and very friendly crew IFE was excellent. KUL-MEL BNE-KUL what difference snarly crew things were thrown at people and I saw a couple of people even being shouted at. For BNE-KUL leg the seat belt sign was left on for 5 hours even though no turbulence and crew refused any hot drinks. I looked forward to KUL- LHR but was in bottom deck of full flight and seats are very uncomfortable there and only 2 drink runs were done for 14 hour flight people were all pressing call button. Reason I chose Malaysia is so we could get BA miles but when returned discovered no miles awarded as was 'deeply discounted fare' even though was not cheapest and only £10 cheaper than CX who would have given miles. Not worthy of oneworld membership based on economy product.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,MH408 on 20th Feb 2015. Kuala Lumpur to Taipei. Excellent customer service. Cabin crew were very friendly and professional. The food was delicious. The IFE was good in choice and excellent. Overall excellent flight service and comfortable seat. I will keep flying with MAS.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,"Business class MNL-KUL/KUL-CDG and CDG-KUL/KUL-MNL. The crew on all our flights were very friendly and efficient (especially on MH21 on 7 March 2015). The seats were comfortable on the A380 and the food was good as we used the ""chef on call"" option. Not that big an issue but my only negative point in an otherwise very pleasant experience is that our luggage did not arrive with us in Manila and we had to wait for over two hours for our checked baggage to arrive on a subsequent flight."
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,6,Flew Bali to Bangkok via KL on the 16 February. Took part in the business upgrade promotion and was successful. This really was a tale of two flights. The first leg to KL was just ok the food was terrible though and the flight attendants disinterested. After a few refreshing hours in the lounge at KL it was time for the flight to Bangkok again business class. Same aircraft 777-800 and what a difference with an energetic and professional crew. In all honesty would have been disappointed if I had paid a full business class fare.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,Travelled on MH176 from MLE-KUL. Was a redeye flight and was glad to catch some sleep. Meal was served and to my surprise it was a full meal! (Bun with butter salad main dessert) I was expecting the Mealbox that only consisted the hot meal and a cookie. Kudos to MH for that. Cutlery still isn't metal but same time isn't the crappy plastic ones. It's the more solid type of plastic! Kudos to them again. Enjoyed the Boeing Sky Interior on the B737-800 9M-MXH. Plane was very clean but MAS has to reconsider changing their pillows as they are so bad. That's the only downside other than the 20 minute delay which was due to the late arrival of the aircraft and runway congestion (both SQ and EK had to depart at the same time). Definitely recommend it as the price I paid is 3-4 times cheaper than SQ.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,I am a frequent customer of MAS. I have noticed that there are some improvements and also down falls. Their improvement is that they changed all their aircraft to new ones. The down falls are that the new seats are really tight (especially on the 737) Food portion decreased tremendously (even on the A380 routes) in-flight entertainment was fine but compared with other airlines its considered less and their hard products aren't really much to be impressed about. Their cabin crew are friendly but they can definitely do better. But the price is really good so i have no complaints about that. I really hope MAS would step up their game if they want to compete with other airlines. But all in all it is a good airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,no,1,Just returned from holiday to Thailand flying out from London to KL and on to Krabi. First time with MA. Both flights were late but that was the least of the problems! We arrived in Krabi on Saturday 28th Feb - our luggage arrived late on Sunday 1st Mar. Several other passengers on the flight and the following flight that afternoon suffered the same problem. Coming home we flew from Koh Samui to KL and then on to London - again both flights were delayed. This time however there was a 50% improvement they managed to deliver us and 1 of our 2 cases at the same time and in the same place - well done MA! Again there were around 20 other passengers who had delayed baggage. Seriously what kind of an outfit manages to mislay a passenger's cases twice on the same trip? Absolute shower. I shall never fly with this airline again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,MH408 on 20th Feb 2015. Kuala Lumpur to Taipei. Excellent customer service. Cabin crew were very friendly and professional. The food was delicious. The IFE was good in choice and excellent. Overall excellent flight service and comfortable seat. I will keep flying with MAS.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,4,yes,5,Took SIN-KUL-PEN-KUL-SIN in February 2015 on Business Class. Each short leg I was served a hot tasty meal with linen napkins I was quite surprised. Very friendly professional staff. Clean cabins and warm Service. I was quite happy. There was no entertainment during the short flight.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew Bali - KUL (777) and KUL - Krabi - KUL - Bali (737). The 777 cabin is old and dated but the sense of space is unbeatable. I would even prefer it over their 'newer' A330 longhaul business seat. On the three 737 sectors nice comfortable cradle seats with in seat AVOD IFE on two of the three 737 sectors. On the KUL - Bali flight without in seat TV we were given portable IFE players which was unexpected on such a short flight. Crew were excellent - considering that they all would have lost friends and colleagues this is a credit to them. Food was good a choice of three mains on each flight. Would definitely recommend.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,4,yes,5,Reasonable Business Class Product but economy is not as god as other full service airlines. Flew BKK-KUL economy KUL-SYD Business and SYD-KUL-BKK economy. Business was due.to an MH Upgrade bid being accepted. I found the staff in business were friendly and proactive but in economy they can be surly and do not go out of their way at all to be of assistance. Golden Lounge in KUL was large but the food selection was limited despite Malaysia having some excellent dishes. On board the satay was excellent but my chef on call meal was accompanied by very hard vegetables. Dessert had no choice and was not exciting. Wine choice was excellent. The seat is better than economy but the angle made me feel like I always had to prop myself up so thank goodness for the footrest. Economy food was lacklustre and the wine is just palatable. Service not happy no menus and it took more than an hour for drinks to be served on a two hour flight. I did not see the staff come through with water or other drinks once. IFE is OK but it takes some time to get going and the collect the headphones a long time before landing and then show arrival videos. OK for a first time flyer but annoying for more frequent travellers. Overall it was safe online check in 48 hours before flight is good safety not an issue. MH just needs to elevate staff attitudes and encourage a bit more friendliness and the perception of their product will improve even if the hard product does not. Good prices make MH a decent choice but they are not as good as other one world carriers.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,KUL-LHR MH04 Economy 13th Feb 2015. The flight is slightly delayed for about 30 mins waiting for air traffic controller's authorisation for departure. Cabin is clean and seat is only as comfortable as any economy seat can be. Inflight meal: got a pleasant surprise of satay being served to all economy passengers. Although only a very small portion it is a remarkably nice effort. Both lunch and dinner are adequately proportion edible nice. Seated at 80G the flight attendant in charge of that aisle was excellent. She helped 2 elderly couples who initially were seated in the middle 80E F to empty seats in front for their convenience. Same upbeat moods were also seen in other staff casual chat with passengers including helping some of the passengers in taking pictures. Inflight entertainment is good. Wide selections with both new and old movies all functioning well. Flight overall was smooth. Landing is smooth as always. Arrival is about 30mins late and that is inclusive of 3 circles over London sky due to congestion in Heathrow. Luggage are out by the time I got through the immigration. No damage noted. All in all a very satisfactory journey and glad to see the cabin staff in an upbeat mood. With the price that I got (unbelievably low) it's really a winner.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Johor Bahru-Kuala Lumpur in Boeing 737-800 and Kuala Lumpur-Guangzhou in Airbus A330-300. Both flights were on- time with fast boarding. The service from flight attendants was great even thought the meal service was delayed due to shortage of crew during my flight to Guangzhou. The refreshments served were just moderate but the meals served were excellent both Nasi Lemak and noodles served with chicken and black pepper sauce. Very comfort seat and various selection in its inflight entertainment system except for some categories. Can get a 5-star service with less money spend would recommend.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,KUL-TPE (21 Feb MH408) and TPE-KUL (28 Feb MH367) with B738. Excellent service by very professional crew on both flights. Excellent food (especially the satay) and wine. Seats definitely comfortable for the 4 hour flight. The Purser on the TPE-KUL flight surprised me with a gift (being a One World Platinum). I look forward to flying MH again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,4,yes,5,MEL-KUL-PNH/BKK-KUL-MEL. My trips were nothing to cheer about and as a strong supporter of MAH for a long time I considered myself as a low-maintenance passenger still I came out of flying with MH very disappointed. Crew members were so-so on their performance. Meal serving time looked like they do a sprint race rushing through to have the job done quickly so they'd time for themselves behind those blinds. There was only one time of drink offering between meal during 7h and 10mins. That soggy roll/sandwich served as breakfast was so pathetic and inedible. It's amazed me how once a five star carrier now becomes the ordinary one. MH please raise your game and don't take your passengers for granted.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,LHR-KUL-ADL and return. A380 very quiet and comfortable no problem sleeping meals fine especially the Satay. A330 on the second leg the seating not at the same standard but just about OK for the length of trip. The only problem we encountered was the return KUL-LHR leg delayed by over an hour with no sign of any apology FA were also very poor hardly a smile to be seen and quite abrupt which in my experience is most unusual for MH.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Took MH760 from KUL-SGN on 19th February 2015. I was upgraded to Business Class through MH Upgrade option. Definitely worth the money. The Regional Golden Lounge was superb! The lunch served Chicken Biryani was delicious together with Cappuccino Cake as a dessert. Cabin crew was usual MH top notch friendly staff definitely recommend the MH Upgrade option to experience MH Business Class service. Will always choose MH as preferred airlines to fly with.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo 9 February. The best part of the flight was the excellent customer service. Very friendly and professional. The food was quite average. Chicken and vegetables for lunch and the snack towards the end of the flight was a soggy tuna roll. The IFE was quite limited as well. But again it was the excellent flight service that saved the trip for me.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,4,yes,6,MEL-PNH-MEL. I've flown with MH 5 times in the last 15 months and noticed nothing improved in staff performance and catering Staff looked businesslike not much time to smile and abrupt. Food was so-so and I must admit that soggy roll/sandwich served as breakfast from KUL to MEl was so revolting. Only once or twice were drinks served between meals for the whole 7 hour flight. MH is now just a bit above budget carriers that means well below par for an airline that used to be 5 star. Still I'll continue to fly them because of their competitive price.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,AMS-KUL MH019. KUL-MNL MH806. MNL-KUL MH803. KUL-AMS MH016. The trip was all in all good but it seems that the seats in economy 777 are getting worse in comfort - very hard. They need to refurbish economy class. The crew were polite and very helpful.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,I am on my 'mileage run' trips in March the first 2 legs was semi-long haul KUL-ICN Return in Business class with MAS MH66 and MH77 on 28 Feb (outbound) and 2-Mar (inbound). Since I only had about 16 hours in Incheon the cabin crew who served on the both flights are the same set of crew. Boarding/Depart/Arrival - Both were on time. Priority boarding for business class pax was observed. It was a full Business Class pax load all 36 seats were filled (MH 66) and 30 pax on MH 67. Generally smooth process. Seat/IFE/Amenities - I reckon the major downside of MAS is the hard product of its Business Class. The flight was on A330-300 aircraft (2-2-2) which was generally mediocre with angled lie flat bed. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but I found it to be comfortable and had a good sleep. I would really recommend that MAS upgrade the quality of its pillow blanket etc especially in terms of the fabric which looked 'very cheap' certainly not luxurious-looking compared to offerings from say Qatar. Having said that they did serve the intended purpose. IFE: Like always I enjoyed the IFE offerings. It may not have the most volume in terms of selection but every time I manage to find something interesting to watch. There was no amenity kit provided on this leg for flight time of 6 hours (another let down) but the amenities provided in its lavatories were adequate for red-eyed flight e.g. shaving kit toothbrushes and scented spray. I think the hard product really needs new/modern make-over even on A330 to remain competitive with other carriers and exudes more of that luxurious taste. Perhaps a Herringbone layout with all aisle access bigger/higher resolution screen with touchpad controller fully lie-flat bed and more luxurious comfort kit offerings? Food - Delicious as always. The Signature Dish - Satay needs no introduction. I ordered Chef-On-Call for both legs of which were delicious (MH66 - Fried Noodles with black paper chicken; MH 67 - Beef Tenderloin with Green Peppercorn). Besides the main Bus Class pax was also served light refreshment such as dessert fresh fruits and Hagen Dasz ice-cream. However due to turbulence on MH66 no hot beverages were served which was quite a let down. Cabin Crew - Genuine smiles I was addressed by name at all times. Crew efficiency was excellent on both flights no long waiting to be served with meals or other ad-hoc requests. What impressed me was the attention to detail that the crew did. Generally I was very satisfied with this trip from all aspects. The main improvement needed is on the hard product offerings even on A330 type of aircraft which are truly a let down given their excellent service of cabin crew/F&B.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,Travelled from DPS to BKK via KUL. Flew on 777 and 737. Good clean planes but what stood out was the service from the flight attendants. They were very friendly and the service was excellent. All in all it was a great experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,4,no,4,ADL-KUL-PNH and return. Outbound ADL-KUL the crew were very ordinary. Plane was only half full but flight attendants rushed through drinks and meal service to hide for the for the majority of the flight. Meals were virtually thrown at the passengers. KUL-PNH was better but crew did their job-no more. Legroom was extremely tight. Return sectors were better but standards no match for rival airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Flew MEL-KUL return on MH146 and MH147 on A333. First time flown was not disappointed with anything major apart from the fact that the return flight was delayed for about an hour. The food was fine. The entertainment system was okay apart from the slightly slow speed but I kind of expected it. I liked how there was an online option for reading the inflight magazine which was very detailed. I wouldn't hesitate about booking with MH again.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,1,My recent flight from KL to Bali and return was the worst I had taken with MAS. The crew service was so bad that I felt like I was a burden to airline. The food onboard consist of a bun and what l was told was chicken on a 3 hour flight and on the return flight a snack sized chicken with potatoes (at least it was a hot meal). What happened to the warm buns with butter served with a side salad and a dessert which MAS used to give even on a 2 hour flight? In addition technical glitches on the seat display screen showed that we were flying across Eastern Europe when we were flying across Indonesia. On the way back the distance from location was displayed at 1145 KM from destination for the entirety of the flight. The seat was constantly in a reclining position even after many attempts to straighten it (please look into fixing seat 16A flight no. MH 714 25th Feb 2015).
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,London-Kuala Lumpur. Check-in through business class check-in due to oneworld membership. Very fast check-in. Flight was on an airbus A380. Flight was delayed by 1 hour due to 'late arrival from Kuala Lumpur'. Boarding was fast and efficient. Extremely big plane and seats were very big compared to MAS and Qatar's A330 seats. Food was served twice with snacks in-between. The first meal 'lasagne' wasn't that nice. The second meal 'fried mee' was extremely delicious. Drink and snacks were served frequently. Crew members were extremely friendly. Entertainment was extremely good. Arrived kl 50 minutes late. Overall extremely good flight. Will fly again with MAS.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,First time on MAS for a long time Jakarta to London via KL. First flight was bang on time newish looking aircraft with good seats decent IFE and nice food. The long haul flight to London was pretty good when we eventually boarded it as it was delayed 15 hours due to a technical fault. The ground staff were quick to organise hotels for everyone but were completely clueless when trying to rebook me and various other stranded business class passengers onto other carriers as an alternative - given that this was at MAS's base this stretched credulity. Once onboard the A380 to LHR the standard of the product remained as good as the first flight albeit with even more room and a decent proper flat bed seat (which was a lot comfier that its conventional appearance suggested). It's a shame that the management of the delay put a major downer on what otherwise was a good experience MAS could do with a few lucky breaks at the moment and it feels as if they shot themselves in the foot here.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,3,yes,6,I flew back from holidays on Malaysia Airlines MH21 from CDG to KUL on Business in early January. Overall is fantastic and we had great food from Paris until KLIA. Seating on the Airbus A380 was great but my daughters seat was not working well and she did not enjoy her trip home. Services from the stewardesses and flight manager were fantastic as expected from Malaysia Airlines but some improvements are badly needed especially no toiletries bag provided anymore on Business Class.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,It is with a very heavy heart that after travelling with Malaysian Airlines for over 20 years on a twice a year basis and enjoying the wonderful cabin servicing they offer I have to write this report. On boarding from LHR in the upper deck I asked the hostess if she could put my bag in overhead locker as I had wrist splints on for Arthritis I was amazed that she pointed to my wife and demanded why she would not do it. At 5 ft my wife could not reach the locker so reluctantly she put the case up for me. Thus began a very miserable flight. Cabin crew did not serve hot drinks throughout the 12 hour flight only on demand then reluctantly. Food was OK but served with a miserable attitude by all the crew. This sort of attitude shown by the crew will not help an ailing airline. Come on Malaysian get your act together and serve those who are willing to keep loyal to you.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,MH 367 TPE-KUL on 4 Feb. Using the B738 with new Boeing interior. Flights on time. Food delicious and good enough portion. I was very enjoy the flight for over 4 hours flight. Good inflight entertainment and the cabin crew serve in professionally. Overall is excellent and I will support and fly with MH again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,I flew from Seoul (ICN) to Kuala Lumpur (KUL) on an A330. Flight was delayed 1 hour but it didn't matter so much since we arrived at gate 30-40 mins before boarding and everything just seemed normal to me. Seat was very comfortable and food was not too bad. The touch screen wasn't working very well but still there were some good movies to watch. Staff were very kind although some were wearing too much makeup. The toilet was very clean. I would definitely fly with MAS again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,KL - Auckland return flight in economy. I chose MAS because it was the only direct flight from Malaysia to Auckland and of course the cheap promotion fares. Checked in process was smooth and flight boarding on time. I couldn't believe when I stepped into the plane because it was a really old Boeing model and the floor looked dirty. Seats was just OK and I couldn't sleep for whole night. The inflight entertainment was OK but the screen was so small old and not clear. KL to Auckland - most of the staff were unfriendly. Maybe because of the midnight flight where they can't sleep hence in the bad mood? They seldom walked around with water. However Auckland - KL the staff were efficient and friendly. Plane looked better and not as old like the Boeing flight from KL to Auckland. Food and beverages were good.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,CGK-KUL-HKG on 5 February. The first leg was on a 737-800 new aircraft with quite decent IFE. Staff were fine with fair service. One thing to note is the cleanliness. The aircraft is brand new but it seems to be a lack of maintenance for the interior. 2nd leg flight was using the 777-200 MH72. It seemed aged but surprisingly the seat is more comfortable and legroom was spacious. Served lunch and offered drinks generously by the female FA. Unfortunately the other male flight attendant was not friendly at all.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,SIN-KUL on MH608. Travelled Business Class SIN-KUL-AKL. Poor selection of food at Lounge on KLIA magazines etc in seat holder dirty and placed any old how. No menu - air crew just came around asking each person if they wanted the beef or chicken dish. Preordered meal had to be handed back as it was inedible. Staff lacked any sense of customer service. Cabin looking tired. Just received the Malaysian Airlines ENRICH membership card upon return home - it went straight into the bin as I will never be flying Malaysian again.

,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,MH 624/804 Dec 20 2014. SIN-KUL-MNL and MNL-KUL-SIN. My only complaint is the very slow check-in service in NAIA Terminal 1 took us 1 hr in the line.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Flew MH 131 KUL-AKL Business Class on Jan 31 on B 777-200. First time flying Business Class on MH. Appalled by overall experience. The only positive aspect of the experience was the seat which was reasonably comfortable (even if not 180 degree lie flat). Warning signs started a few days earlier when attempted to book a meal online through Chef-on-Call service. Unable to do so due to maintenance issues had to call MH Contact Centre. Golden Lounge at KLIA had adequate seating but poor selection of food staff did not greet you personally upon being seated in business class cabin as I had come to expect with many other airlines on Business Class magazines on pocket of front seat dishevelled and looked dirty no food menu - cabin staff came around asking if you would like the lamb or the fish (with no further description offered - this occurred for both meals served during the flight) the meat dish I had pre-ordered had to be returned as it was inedible. A cloth serviette was place on your tray and a clothe serviette containing cutlery was then given to you prior to being served your meal - ie there was no laying of the table for you. Staff seemed hurried and uncaring. Cabin looked tired with threadbare carpet. IFE substandard. MH Enrich Loyalty Card going in the bin - as I won't be flying MH again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,KUL-HKG-KUL on MH72 and MH73. Both legs flown by MH's 20 year workhorse 772s. Didn't think too much of the supposed loud engine noise seen in some of the comments here. Prefer these older 772 seats with MH rather than the new ones installed in their 388s and 738s as they have more legroom pitch and comfort. Plane interior (seat pockets galleys toilets etc.) were quite clean well maintained and in good working order. FAs were quite friendly and helpful on both legs. Drinks served every hour with meal and snacks served throughout the 3+ hour flight. Only slight comment would be about the IFEs on the 772s. Smaller and dated screen compared to the newer MH planes but functions just as well as the new systems.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,no,5,PVG-KUAL-CDG on 22 Jan 2015 MH 389 Airbus A330-300 MH 20 Airbus 380. I took 2 flights both flights in economy. Staff in the air are efficient. The seats are just OK. The food was so-so I chose the steamed rice and fish but the fish was awful. Concerning the entertainment what is frustrating is the quality of sound which is very low added to the fact there is not a great choice of movies.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,4,no,5,Flew Melbourne-Phuket (via Kuala Lumpur) return. Outbound on an A330. Entertainment was good. Cabin crew were abrupt. First meal was edible but the second was some sort of 'sausage roll' and it was revolting. They didn't offer too many drinks. On the KUL-HKT sector an old 737 was used. We were served the most disgusting soggy roll. At least on this sector the cabin crew were a little more friendly. On the return from HKT to KUL a newer 737 was used the food was quite nice and the cabin crew were friendly. The last flight from KUL to MEL was on an old 777-200. MH rather inconveniently uses a 2-5-2 layout on this plane. The plane was old with an ancient looking entertainment system. The food was okay on this flight and the cabin crew were better than on the flight over. Overall they need for do far better if they want to be an airline of choice in the future.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,no,3,Kuala Lumpur - Ho Chi Minh City return 16-18 Jan. We were a family of 6 adults and 2 kids. Flight was uneventful but I have nothing nice to say about the crew serving us. Outbound the steward sarcastically ticked off my 9 year old nephew for taking a few seconds of his time to decide which meal he wanted. No social etiquette at all. Outbound we were only served a sandwich which was awful. Inbound a stewardess gave my nephew a child's meal but not my 4 year old daughter. When I asked for another one for my daughter she said no I had only ordered one. I am Malaysian and have flown countless times with them but not anymore.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Jan 21 MH 807. Jan 25 MH 804. Round-trip Business class MNL-KUL. Jan 21 and Jan 25. The service from the staff was excellent! The only downside is that the plane looked dirty but maybe it was just old. Other than that - quality service and good value for money. I highly recommended.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,,,3,yes,6,Flew with Malaysian Airlines for the first time for my SGN-KUL trip and was disappointed. Knowing for its five star reputation I had high expectations on this flight. Instead they used an old aircraft with no entertainment. I thought okay if they didn't have IFE maybe magazines will do. But when I took it out the magazines were badly damaged that I don't even want to touch it. So there I was sleeping for the whole entire flight. Meal was pretty good but the flight attendants weren't as nice. They should really keep up with the other competition that are quickly improving.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,AMS-KUL-PER (Economy) 4 of us flew with Malaysia on a round trip from Amsterdam to Perth during January. The staff and comfort on the planes was excellent and with one exception the food was reasonable. The exception was the breakfast on the last leg. A dish of boiled rice with half a boiled egg embedded and what I took to be a savoury sauce on one side. Having stirred it all together I found that it was a very strong curry/pepper of which I was unable to partake as I am not fond of any curry/pepper meals. Curry for breakfast! Come on Malaysia - surely you can do better. However - the Administration Department of Malaysia Airways is awful. I emailed them 3 times with particular problems and did not even receive acknowledgements. We actually started our journey from Dublin but this was with Aer Lingus and I cannot fault them. However they were unable to issue our Malaysia Boarding Cards and told us this had to be done in Amsterdam. Luckily we hurried to the particular desk as we were fourth in the queue. There was a single lady at the desk and she was taking 15 minutes per client. It had something to do with re-routing late arrivals from the incoming plane onto other flights as they had missed their connections. So after an hour we managed to get our passes. But Amsterdam is a big airport and it takes ages to negotiate so we had to be quick in getting to the gate. The flights on the 777 and 330 were very comfortable though they were not the seats I had originally requested. As I said earlier I cannot fault the staff on board. They were very attentive and came round very regularly with drinks. On the last leg (KUL to AMS) the entertainment to two of our seats did not work well and I could only get music which was not a bother as I do not normally watch movies on a plane. However I did miss the flight progress maps. The staff did try to reset the system (twice) but without success. I have used MAH in the past but this experience has dimmed my enthusiasm for them and I may just decide to change operators for my next flight to Australia.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,SIN-KUL-HKG on MH602 and MH72 16 January 2015. Paid to upgrade to Business Class through their MHUpgrade programme as I've never flown Business before and the prices were irresistible. It was rather worth it. Their Golden Lounge in Changi Terminal 2 was small but cosy and had a decent selection of food (could be improved but maybe it's breakfast). The SIN-KUL leg was on an old (leased) 738 so there was no IFE and the Business Class seat was nothing remarkable. Service was good however and they provided some bread for breakfast (early morning flight in fact the earliest possible for SIN-KUL) compared to peanuts for economy class. Golden Lounge in KLIA was better: bigger wider selection of food many comfortable rest areas and comes with a view though it was also quite crowded. Due to short connecting time I did not spend much time in the lounge. KUL-HKG leg was on their 772 which is of some age but the Business class was still well-maintained. Caveat: this being my first time flying Business I have no basis for comparison with other airlines' products. Leg room was excellent seat comfort was good. While the seat is not lie-flat but inclined (angled-flat) I was still able to snooze well for a bit and it was still quite comfortable. Service was great: many flight attendants for Business Class and with low occupancy in Business each passenger received good attention and treatment. They addressed each of us by name and were forthcoming with serving food drinks and newspapers. Flight attendants were very friendly (chatty too) and helpful with my requests. Ordered food via Chef on Call and the steak I ordered was great. Unfortunately I was so full from the meal that I did not finish my dessert. My main quibble would be the IFE which is rather antiquated and has rather limited offerings compared to its newer planes and other airlines. Overall for short or medium- haul flights I'd definitely consider MH again especially given how competitive their pricing is nowadays.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,6,This airline offers a good route network and since it is part of One World I decided to try it out. I took 2 flights CGK to KUL and KUL LHR. Both flights in economy. The staff both on the ground and in the air are charming and efficient. The seats are just OK. The food good. The entertainment system (on the A380) was frustrating to use because the software is inferior to other airlines A380 entertainment systems. However quality of sound and pictures was fine. So far so good. My only issue and one which would make me only use Malaysian as a last resort is the cleanliness of the aircraft. The seats trays magazine pockets magazines windows were all grubby and could do with a good deep clean. The carpets on both flights looked tatty. There were cobwebs between the window panes. The worse thing was the toilets on the 380. I tried 4 of them and all filthy. I am sorry to say that this doesn't meet the standards of other One World carriers or Skytrax 5 star airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,7,HKG-KUL-SIN on MH73 and MH607 19 January 2015. Did not pay to upgrade to Business Class so I flew this return leg on Economy. Still quite worth it (the price was comparable to budget airlines) overall. Just one day before my flight they sent an SMS to tell me that my earlier flight MH449 (on a B738) got cancelled and put me on MH73 (on a B772) scheduled 40 minutes later. Apparently MH449 often gets cancelled probably due to low occupancy. The flight on MH73 was not full too which does indicate much spare capacity on this leg. The B772 I flew for HKG-KUL was of some age evident in the seat design and IFE. Leg room was supposed to be 34 inches (on newer planes it's 30-32 inches) though the difference didn't seem significant. That said I had quite enough space (for someone 1.76m tall) so maybe I'd feel the difference when flying long-haul. I appreciated the 2-5-2 seating arrangement as I like the window seat but hate clamouring over many people to go to the toilet. In any case because the flight was not full my neighbour went somewhere else to snooze. The IFE box under the window seat is rather annoying however. IFE was old (small blurry screen) and the selection was limited. The food served was quite decent especially main course and dessert. The salad was weird though an attempt at Asian-style coleslaw that failed miserably. Service would be my major quibble on top of IFE. Flight attendants did their job but they seemed less warm than compared to my experiences in Business Class on the onward journey to HKG. I found it weird that passengers had to help themselves to the drinks (attendant holds out the whole tray of drinks to you and you take whichever you fancy) instead of the attendant passing the drink to the passenger (which is the case on most flights I've flown). Attendants were occasionally unsmiling or fierce and sometimes their smile seems a bit forced. Thankfully my HKG-KUL leg landed on time because I had a very tight connection to KUL-SIN (thankfully baggage arrived on time too). For the short HKG-KUL leg only peanuts were served. It was a newer 738 so the seats looked fresh and the IFE quality was excellent (not that you use it much on such a short flight). Overall their Economy Class definitely pales in comparison to its full-service competitors but the prices are so competitive that lower expectations are deserved. I'd still consider flying MH in Economy next time especially if the price is right.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,no,5,My partner and I had mixed experiences flying from Frankfurt to Auckland and back in the last month. We chose Malaysia Airlines because of price short connection times and the extra baggage allowance. The flights to NZ were not bad: food was better than expected and service very pleasant too. We had a less than positive experience on our return flights. On the plus side when we noticed that the plane was half empty on the AKL-KL leg and we asked to move to seats with more leg room our request was granted. This made for a very comfortable and pleasant flight. However our second return flight was delayed in KL for some time so we were exhausted and severely sleep deprived by the time the flight finally got clearance to take off. The plane was very full and it was an older plane with rather an incredibly noisy engine and rather tired seats - not in the best condition. Both of our entertainment units were not working properly so we couldn't watch movies and the staff seemed too busy and stressed too help. The fish we were served was too spicy to eat (and we are used to eating fairly hot curries and Indian food) and later we were offered 'spicy prawns' for breakfast - no thanks! We would be very unlikely to fly with Malaysia Airlines again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,MH001 15 Jan LHR-KUL in economy class upper deck seating check in at Heathrow was fast and efficient. On board crew were very pleasant offering plenty of water and juice runs the food was better than my previous flights last year. MH149 19 Jan KUL-MEL in business class on on old B777 even though this aircraft is old it was clean and in good condition. The crew were good but clearly have no knowledge of wines or how and when to serve them in business class you expect good service and knowledge of what they are providing (this was not 5 star service).
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,2,no,2,My wife and I are Platinum One World frequent flyers. We flew from Sydney to KL on MH122 on the 20th of January in business class with our son in business class. The plane was one of the oldest I have ever flown on. The staff were not welcoming and proceeded to talk the entire flight loudly in the galley. The toilets were flooded and dirty yet no effort was made to clean them. The entire crew attitude was unhelpful and a poor reflection on Malaysians who are typically very warm and welcoming. This was the worst business class flight I have experienced.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,no,3,I flew Malaysian Airlines for the first time in business class from London to Kuala Lumpur on Christmas Eve. The plane was an A380 and the seat was comfortable. The cabin crew in business were the most unfriendly team I have encountered in the sky. When asked why the standard pre-flight drink of bubbly was not available a cabin staff member said that this was due to customs regulations. Red wine with the main meal was served cold. While the facility to pre-order meals is a positive feature business class with this airline is poor value compared to that available from other carriers flying between Ireland/UK and South East Asia.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,no,5,My partner and I had mixed experiences flying from Frankfurt to Auckland and back in the last month.

We would be very unlikely to fly with Malaysia Airlines again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,,,3,yes,5,The ratings posted here are the ratings I've flown on more frequently on the B777-200 from Mumbai to Kuala Lumpur. The aircraft had a clean and tidy cabin and all seats have a different colour. Toilets were hygienic enough. The staff service is terrible because they don't respond at all! The seats were comfortable enough that I was able to sleep well on the seat. The Indian food they catered was warm and delicious but their items are always exactly the same every time I've flown on the same flight. The entertainment system is really pathetic in terms of the screen quality it is so small and unclear that it could possibly strain one's eyes badly and the touch screen is also very unresponsive. I've flown on another Malaysian airline flight from Hyderabad to KL in brand new B737-800. That was a very good flight with nice IFE and it had it had USB slot luckily as my phone battery was dead.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew from Cairns to Phuket with Qantas and Malaysia Airlines. On way via Darwin return via Sydney. Airfare was cheapest around. I booked 2 days before I left which was during the Xmas/New Year period. I was very impressed all around. Airfares Staff comfort punctuality special order vegetarian meal. I did have a 6 hour layover in Kuala Lumpur both ways which was really enjoyable. I took the train to the city and went on the Hop on/off Tourist bus which was great value. I felt safe locals were friendly and English was spoken everywhere. I will fly with them again if the price is right.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,no,2,Flew AMS-KUL on MH19 on what was a very old cabin and seat (777-200). Cabin crew were not at all welcoming on boarding the plane and this just set the scene for the whole flight. The seat is an angle lie flat very uncomfortable and not a seat I have used in about 10 years of flying in business. Also wasn't offered a mattress for the seat. The TV screen was small and low resolution the headphones cheap plastic not noise cancelling and with a poor connection which affected the sound quality. Food was ok however the nasi lemak for breakfast came with a watery curry sauce and was poorly presented. My biggest gripe is reserved for the cabin crew who seemed to want to do the minimum possible they offered the minimum of drink services the seat belt sign was kept on for almost the entire flight meaning they refused to make hot drinks although apart from this restriction all the passengers and crews seemed to ignore the seat belt sign and walked about as normal. Yes I know its the flight deck that switches the sign on however the flight had next to no turbulence. Overall this was the worst business class flight I have ever been on. Their competition is supposed to be Cathay/Singapore/Emirates but they came nowhere near those airlines.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,6,KL to MEL 4th Jan. Flight was 45 mins late leaving but these things happen. Crew were very attentive throughout the flight. They really couldn't do enough for you. Meals were quite good and the drinks flowed freely. Water was constantly topped up and always done with a smile. We have flown MAS quite a lot in the last few years and never had any complaints. It is the crew that contributes to a pleasant flight and this crew was no exception. We traveled on the A330-300 and the seats are not so comfortable.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,7,KUL-PER the trip was very comfortable on an otherwise fully filled flight. We enjoyed not being squashed into a budget airline. We looked forward to our meals but my wife found the choice of a spicy chicken curry or fish to not be much of a choice. She chose the chicken and found it too hot to be edible. Surely on a route that has many non Malaysians flying on it a non spicy non fish meal could be offered. I ordered a vegetarian but was disappointed to find it mainly to be pasta and mushrooms. The gate check-in in KL was unbelievably slow close to 90 minutes to check everyone in.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,17 Dec MH 1140 KUL-PEN. MH 1167 PEN-KUL. Both flights were on time. They are using the B738 with new Boeing interior. I was very happy with the MH service for a 45 minute flight. Flight from KUL-PEN was full but cabin crew managed it professionally. Will flying again with this airline.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Very good first experience on MAS SIN-KUL-KIX on economy and return on business. Check-in at SIN was fast hassle-free and baggage was released timely at KIX airport. It was an overnight flight on New Year's Eve and clock struck 12 a while after take off so pilot wished us a Happy New Year and we happened to be able to see fireworks in the distance from our windows. Refreshments (a tuna croissant and drinks) were served about 45 mins after take off shortly after cabin lights were dimmed for pax sleeping. Lights gradually turned on (instead of a flick - from total darkness to instant brightness) and breakfast served 1.5hrs before landing. Took the Nasi Lemak set and it tasted pretty good. Check-in at KIX was done really swiftly (less than 10 minutes) staff was courteous and welcoming. Did not get to use the lounge as I was running late. Seats reclined comfortably duvet was soft and comfortable. Drinks and nuts served before flight took off. Food commenced shortly after flight took off. Appetizer was Beef and Chicken satay too much sauce for me but delicious nonetheless. Next up was the soba + mini sandwiches + smoked salmon/chicken breast appetizer. Main course was beef tenderloin. Dessert (I requested for it to be served 2hrs before landing) was a slice of pie/cake with blueberry sauce. I had a good rest on the 8hrs flight to KUL. Flight attendants were attentive and smiley. Would definitely fly MAS again if I have the chance.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,KUL-LHR. Overnight flight which was very comfortable. The cabin supervisor made a point of greeting everyone by name and introducing himself to everyone. The cabin crew were very attentive and friendly. Meals were served in a timely fashion and bottled water offered throughout the flight. Announcement that no hot drinks would be served which seems a common theme on these flights with the exception of Breakfast coffee which was served in a nice big mug. Standard of catering good. Seat comfort good and I managed to get a few decent hours of sleep on the flat bed although there is a distinct lack of privacy with the configuration of the seats. Well crewed in business class who were all very cheerful and friendly with four cabin crew to 18 passengers. I would definitely fly with Malaysia again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,I flew CGK-KUL-PEN vv. When I was waiting for the CGK-KUL flight MH send an sms which they informed that my KUl- PEN flight would be delayed for 2 hours. Later the captain informs the reason of the delay and apologize. The sandwich served between CGK-KUL was fine. One of the male crew was rude and never smiled at all. The others were fine. All aircraft was new 737 with sky interior except for PEN-KUL flight which is an old 737. Overall MH is fine.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,no,6,MNL-KL-CDG Dec. 20 2014 and returned Jan. 4 2015. The trip to Paris was delayed from Manila and we were concerned that we might either miss the flight to Paris or our baggage might get delayed. Luckily this didn't happen. We also had chef on call meals which was a good option. The flight from KL-CDG used the A380 and it was a good experience for us overall. However on the return flight we tried to request the meal via email but their office was closed since they only work Monday to Friday Malaysian time. We asked at check-in but it was too late. No amenities onboard - when I asked the staff they said they were forgotten by the airline. We arrived into KL with about an hour to spare before the next flight (this was meant to be a 2 hour layover) but when we arrived in Manila our luggage was not with us. The plane from KL to Manila was old and dirty.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,7,KL to Melb. 4th Jan. Flight delayed by 45 mins but these things happen. The staff were very attentive and happy going about their job. Meals were of quite a good standard and the drinks flowed freely. Water was topped up on a regular basis and always done with a smile. Have travelled with MAS quite a lot over the last few years and never had any problems they are a great airline and would not hesitate to use them in the future. We did travel on the A330-300 and I find the seats quite uncomfortable 777 seats are a lot more comfortable.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,no,7,Flew KL-CDG with their A-380. On the flight to Paris the trip was mostly good. Staff were good with their service. Seat lie flat but a bit hard on the back. Lower feet portion has no problem. Food was ok Inflight entertainment was good. However on our return flight the toiletries is missing. Slippers were not given. Staff were attentive to our needs but you can see that quality of service is not there. Toilets are not being cleaned so you go in with wet floors. Some of the toilets are closed because the flush is not working. Not your typical business class service and comfort. So much lacking on this Airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,6,Ho Chi Minh City to Kuala Lumpur on December 29 2014. The only 4 check-in counters open and I had to wait approx. 45 mins although only about 10 people queuing. The flight used a B737-800 and the crew were good. The magazines and newspapers were in a bad shape. The food were good (didn't get any options since they were running out of food). The luggage took another 45 minutes to come out.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Very nice trip with MAS. First trip ever with them. First economy onward journey AMS-KUL-DPS and Business return. In a very empty business class (4 out of 30 seats were occupied) we travelled with a 6 month very comfortably. Staff was nice and accommodating. Only con was the food we are vegetarians and they catered for religious vegetarians. Well cannot blame them as it is difficult to cater for us. The trip went very well lounge access priority baggage handling. Will definitely fly again with MAS.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,"LHR-KUL on 3rd January - check in at LHR was very slow indeed with only one biz class counter open initially. The lounge was fine busy but space to sit offering a good breakfast selection for the 10.50am flight. Friendly welcome on board (much better than the outbound 2 weeks ago when the unfriendly stewardess at the door looked at my boarding pass and simply said ""This way"" and pointed - no smile or greeting of any kind.) The upper deck cabin is comfortable and spacious and the window seats have loads of storage space. The seat was OK but I didn't really find it particularly comfortable for sleeping even with the mattress topper. A bigger softer pillow would have been good. The crew was very proactive and efficient throughout the flight. The chef on call service worked fine and the food was pretty good with a decent snack bar set up at the front mid flight. The IFE was just ok - seemed to be a lot of the same selection as there was in December. KUL-CGK on 737-800 was fine - much more comfortable than European short haul in J class. Overall it was a good experience - I'd happily choose Malaysian again if fares are competitive."
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,2,no,3,Business Class in A330 and A380 LHR/KL/SYD return. Definitely a long way short of the mark in just about every aspect. The business class seats in the A330 are not good at all and don't afford comfort in just about any position. The A380 seat is acceptable but a long way short of the major players such as SQ/EH /Cathay. The entertainment system had a pretty ordinary selection of movies. There were not a lot to choose from or someone at Malaysian has a love of sci-fi and kids movies. Food very ordinary and the Book the Chef a waste of time. Of the 4 meals two of my booked meals arrived. The lounge in KL is way way way short of the mark. Would I fly them again? No.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,7,Flew from Helsinki to Bangkok via Frankfurt and Kuala Lumpur and return to Helsinki via Kuala Lumpur and London Heathrow. Frankfurt to Kuala Lumpur was one the most enjoyable flights ever. Extremely friendly crew excellent food drinks we're offered all the time including beer and wine. Snack box was given and flight was in time. The seat comfort was excellent even though the B777-200 shows its age. Return flight from KUL to London was a totally different experience. The seats are not very comfortable more cramped however the IFE is better. The A380 is a beauty to fly as silent as flying can be. Crew was not friendly. Food was bad reminding me food that you get in a short haul flight. No snack box was offered just some cookies and apples in a basket. Selection of drinks more limited. In general I was looking forward to the flight but MAS seems hit and miss. KUL is an easy airport for transit and I would use Malaysia Airlines again. I know they are trying to save money and I don't mind less IFE and less food but what I mind is warmth and friendliness of the crew.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,no,1,Economy Class from KUL-SYD. I fly this route regularly. Glad to see they finally changed the menu after a few years. IFE selection was fairly poor for New Release Movies but the rest was OK. Seat very uncomfortable. Crew were very abrupt and rude. I interacted with 5 on this flight and they all were very rude and seemed annoyed by every request. MAS is a very average airline but I have no choice on this route.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,4,yes,6,I flew MH from Perth to KL and again KL to Siem Reap. Normally I would fly QF to. Sin but they no longer offer full service flights out of Perth. Anyway MH offered a flight at a reasonable hour of the day and a good price. The plane was fine the flight into KL early and essentially turbulence free despite warnings. Seat comfort is just OK. The biggest complaint is with the quality of the service. Staff seemed surly and uninterested. Food quality was also average whilst the drinks seemed positively stingy. Wine was very cheap quality and when I asked for a soft drink I got a glass mostly full of ice with a dash of coke and no can to refill the glass. Give me the whole can. Could also increase frequency of water handouts especially one just before descent. The flying was ok but a little more effort would go a long way.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew from London to KL and back both ways on the top deck of the A380. The cabin crew were OK polite and friendly. There were frequent food and drink runs so I didn't need to bring out the snacks I had brought with me. There was plenty to watch in the IFE system. The seats were fine considering this was economy with enough leg room as long as you don't get someone in front of you reclining their seat for the whole flight!
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,2,no,3,Business Class in A330 and A380 LHR/KL/SYD return. Definitely a long way short of the mark in just about every aspect. The business class seats in the A330 are not good at all and don't afford comfort in just about any position. The A380 seat is acceptable but a long way short of the major players such as SQ/EH /Cathay. The entertainment system had a pretty ordinary selection of movies. There were not a lot to choose from or someone at Malaysian has a love of sci-fi and kids movies. Food very ordinary and the Book the Chef a waste of time. Of the 4 meals two of my booked meals arrived. The lounge in KL is way way way short of the mark. Would I fly them again? No.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,5,yes,8,MEL-KUL-PVG return. This is my first trip with Malaysia. All flights were punctual. Planes were clean but a bit old which takes away from elegance and presentation. The food was delicious but the drink selection was somewhat limited. The entertainment system was not up to scratch. Most movies were old and choice of video games was limited. The music system was fine. The toilets at the back of the plane were small. There is nothing wrong with Malaysia Airlines but nothing to inspire either. They do a good job at providing basic service (nothing exceptional). Value for money it is excellent.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,8,Phnom Penh - KL - Bali on 20th Dec. Nice new Boeing plane very good inflight system with reasonable films polite crew clean plane. Food was fine given each leg was relatively short. Perfectly happy with Malaysian and will fly with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,SIN-KUL-CDG and same for return. Flight from SIN-KUL and vice versa expected to be full. Efficient service but experience marred with passengers who clearly don't understand the meaning of checking in their bags. Single aisle plane meant that if you are at the back of the plane be prepared. To wait for the passengers upfront to get offload their bags from the overhead cabins. In all not airline fault but idiotic passengers. KUL-CDG flight was not full thus my partner and I had an empty seat between us. This improved our mood for the long 13hrs flight to Paris. Cabin crews were excellent engaging us with small talks n such. No problem with food onboard. CDG-KUL flight was full and I was sandwiched between my partner and a dude. Just got a nasty shock that when I opened the magazine holder there were used tissue. Again not cabin crew's fault instead the ground handling staffs at Paris for not cleaning the plane properly. Requested for cabin crew to clear the tissue away and she apologized profusely for the oversight which I think was very sincere. The breakfast on plane was god-sent which was nasi lemak and sambal shrimp. After having days of non-spicy food (mustard is crap btw) the breakfast served was attuned to my taste even though I tasted better nasi lemak I have no complains here. All in all MAS may find a supporter in me who will forgo SIA for better fares.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,2,"Flew SIN-KUL-AMS on December 23 2014. The SIN to KUL was delayed for an hour but it was okay because we were flying Business. We stayed in the lounge while waiting. Lounge was very quiet with total of 6 passengers using it. Food and drinks selection was okay. We loved the satay and wines. Flight was quick comfortable seats and with some refreshment. It was with a new plane B737-800. Service was excellent! KUL-AMS was also delayed for 45 minutes. They could not get a clearance for take off and also waiting for other delayed passengers (like us). The transfer was nicely organized. It was with B772ER an old plane. Small personal screens limited and not so great selection of movies/entertainment. Food was fish or chicken. I chose fish which was overcooked. It was served with veggies that were very salty. Breakfast was Nasi Lemak or Omelette. The omelette was nice served with sausage and hash brown. My partner chose Nasi Lemak and it was very spicy for breakfast. Seats were comfortable in the economy although it can be improved and need some cleaning. It was lots of leg space for tall guys like me(40D). We had 4 rows on our own although It was a busy flight. Service was not impressive. After serving the supper most of cabin crews disappeared. They served only one round of drinks throughout the flight. We had to look for them in the pantry area if we need something. Also no snacks were offered in between. One of the cabin crews even asked me ""Boss what do you want?"" We normally take Singapore Airlines and KLM. We took MH because of the pricing. Malaysia Airlines is far from this two in terms of comfort food service and fleet maintenance. I'm a little worried now on my flight back to KUL and to SIN. I hope its a different plane a newer one."
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew from KUL to AMS in Business Class with MH Upgrade on a 777. Lovely experience. Was a bit wary of the angle lie flat seats but as there was an empty seat next to me I had an extra pillow to put under my feet making me lie in a 180 degree position. Slept for eight hours and was very comfortable. Very attentive and friendly FA's. Having flown the first leg AKL to KUL in Economy I couldn't help noticing a difference in attitude between the two crews. In EC they seemed to be going through the motions. Fair enough they did what they were supposed to do but they could have smiled. Having said that I will continue to use and recommend MH. Not only do they offer very competitive prices and a speedy connection to New Zealand they also deserve support after this year's horrific events.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew four legs MAA-KUL-BKK KBV-KUL-MAA in October/November 2014 - a total of about ten hours flying. All flights in Business all in 737-800's. Found it all to be a superior experience - from check in to land and air staff to cleanliness of planes to entertainment (a bit limited but these are 737s) to timeliness. The golden lounge at KUL is excellent - very bright and clean good wifi decent food clean showers. All of it puts North American airlines to shame. I would happily use MH next time I'm in SE Asia.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,,,2,no,1,Very poor experience. Flight delayed on 11 December out of Saigon by 2 hours. They said they would hold the connecting flight to London and that ground staff in KL (their home airport) would be on hand. None of this was true. No information given on the flight about connections. Nobody available on their transfer desk for an hour to sort out issues and took two hours to get transferred overnight to a hotel and re-ticketed. Nobody took responsibility and the duty manager declined to come down and deal with the issues.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,BNE to SIN via KUL. Excellent flight. The business cabin in the new A330 is really good and the crew is very accommodating. The satay is also extremely delicious. The 15.4 inch AVOD screen also had a good selection of movies. The amenity kit was the star of the evening. It had everything you could think and couldn't think of.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,5,no,5,The staff were not friendly for welcoming the customers onboard. The staff did not guide the customers to their seats. Furthermore the cabin crew missed some rows while serving the drinks. The choice of drinks is very limited as well. No biscuit and no bread served but just a small packet of peanuts. The legroom in economy seat was not good. The lavatory was fairly clean. However the ticket price was very reasonable and affordable.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,KUL-SYD. enjoyed Flight except two problems - meal request not available (a first in business class) and FA's disappeared for three hours which happens in a night flights but this was an all day flight. Otherwise good value.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Flying from Singapore to Beijing on 03 November 2014 (MH606 and MH360) and returning on 12 November 2014 (MH361 and MH611) with transit at Kuala Lumpur. 3 of the 4 sectors were near to perfection. Most of the cabin crews were polite. The food and beverage served on board were nice and tasty. The only problem to be mentioned could be the malfunction toilet at the rear of the cabin on the Singapore - Kuala Lumpur sector (MH606).
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,LHR-KUL-AKL-KUL-LHR. A mixed bag. Positives: The A380s are superb esp in top deck economy and they have a very good IFE (if limited in choice compared with EK's). The service was fine and I got this at an excellent fare. Areas which need work: you can't choose your seating online as with EK and have to go through the airline instead; the online check in asks you to print your boarding passes but (at AKL anyway) these had to be reprinted - took extra time; the IFE on the B777 services (to/from AKL) is now next to obsolete and is very limited in its selection. I would fly with them again but they are still somewhat behind the 8-ball.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew from Heathrow to Sydney stopping over in Kuala Lumpur for 2nights 3days. On my return trip I travelled back on my own. My family upgraded me to business class with assistance in place because of health issues. I was looked after from start to finish the service and staff were excellent I have flown with them before and would fly with them again.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,I was on MH132 AKL to KL on 26th November. My bid for an upgrade was accepted so I was in Business Class on the 777-200. I only have praise for the crew the food the comfort and the whole experience. The seats are angle flat but I was able to have at least 6 hours of sleep. I also used the Chef-on-Call option and the food I ordered was really good. Very attentive and friendly crew as well.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,KUL-BKI-KUL (transit in LBU and MYY on the way back). Pleasant experience in all sectors. Good food generous portion. Aircraft clean crews very attentive and helpful. No hotels for transit passengers (more than 6hrs). MH should look on this matter as other major airlines do provide accommodation for transit customers.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,I flew FRA-KUL-SIN with Malaysia on the 23rd of November 2014 in economy and it has been a good experience: The seating in the 777-200 is really good - I like the 2-5-2-configuration at least as long as my wife and I get on the double seats at the windows sitting in the row of 5 would be bothersome on the other hand sitting at the window in a 3-3-3 configuration is nearly the same - 2 persons have to rise if you want to get out. The seat comfort is excellent. I'm traveling a lot and the pitch of 34 inches in economy is world-class in addition to that the seats even if they look a little bit worn have a lumbar support and a good recline. The screens for the IFE are very small but the choice of movies is great so this is ok. The food was the best I ever had in economy class warm tasty and enough staff offered drinks all the time even the wine was of good quality. The only point that should be better is the kindliness if the staff - they did what they had to do but there was no smile at all. The flight KUL-SIN was on a brand-new 737-800 and very short not much to say about that.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,"Flew LHR-KUL-PER on MH3 and MH125 with my wife and 2 year old son. Contrary to what I read about MAS' policy on seating children on top deck in economy I was happy that we had been seated there in the middle row of 4 seats. I was even happier when before take off the stewardess moved the gentleman sat next to us to an exit seat so that we all had more room he was also very pleased. The cabin decor I must say is fantastic compared to the SQ route we took last year it is far ahead. Both planes were also in very good condition compared to other airlines on similar routes e.g. EK and SQ. The seats were well designed but as Mr Walsh has pointed out previously they are not as good as the old 747 seats on older MAS flights. I am also 6""3' and we are talking about economy after all so it can only be bearable. The food on the flight was pretty good for economy there were plenty of beverages served throughout the flight and my wife's veg and sons child's meal were always served first and his tray was always cleared before the remainder of the cabin. The only thing that's worth pointing out is that on EK and SQ for such a long flight there is usually a selection of sandwiches to snack on however we were only given chocolate bars and crips which I thought was a bit cheap. Appreciate the airline is struggling financially but I fail to see how depriving passengers on which is already a long and tiring flight a decent snack. The cabin crew were polite but lacked the Malaysian hospitality that I have come to expect from MAS. Having flown with them regularly since 2004 they were not quite up to the previous standard. They were not rude or anything like that just that they were going through their motions as quickly as possible. Considering the cost of the tickets were several hundred pounds less than SQ or EK I would definitely recommend MH."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,2,yes,7,20th Nov 2014 MH002 Kuala Lumpur (dep 2355) to London Heathrow. Minus points: 1) Uncomfortable seat. I generally find seating less supportive and comfortable than those used on MH and SQ's 747-400 fleets of yesteryear and I have found the seating on SQs and MH's A380 and QR's A330 and A340 to be much of the same. This particular seat felt like it was worn down and it was the emergency exit row seat 42K which I had paid extra for so this was particularly annoying. 2) Cold cabin but nowhere near as cold as the outbound MH001 flight I took on 31st October which I also reviewed. 3) As mentioned in my aforementioned review of the 31st October MH001 flight the in-flight entertainment is lagging behind - slow poorly laid out and not intuitive. Plus points: 1) Attentive and friendly cabin crew as ever. 2) Informative and friendly Captain. 3) Good quality food. 4) The content of in-flight entertainment is sound. General thoughts: An enjoyable flight again but one in which I could not sleep well or get comfortable in. In-flight service is exemplary.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,SYD-LHR-SYD in Business Class. SYD-KUL-SYD on A330-300 and KUL-LHR-KUL on A380. All flights on time. Aircraft on all four flights were new and clean. Cabin crew were excellent on all flights. They were polite helpful friendly and always addressed me by name. Booked meals via Chef-on-call all of which were honoured. Meals were tasty and of a decent portion. IFE was AVOD and had a reasonably good selection of latest releases as well as older favourites. Seats on the A330-300 were comfortable in the sitting and reclining positions but are angled flat and not that comfortable for sleeping. Storage space is severely lacking in these seats. Seats on the A380 are far superior. They are very comfortable in all positions and are completely flat which allowed me to get a good amount of sleep. There is also an excellent amount of storage space especially for window seats. MAS now provide covers for their business class seats that help to smooth out the seat and add a little more padding. Bathrooms were always kept clean on all flights. Priority for premium classes and elite level passengers was provided when available for things such as check-in security and immigration boarding disembarking baggage delivery and customs. Overall an excellent product that is let down a little by the seats on their A330-300 which really need to be completely flat. My only other suggestion for MAS would be to serve champagne as a pre-departure beverage as it is currently their policy not to. Otherwise it was an excellent flight experience from beginning to end and it was also competitively priced which made it excellent value for money. I would not hesitate to fly with them.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,31st Oct 2014 Flight: MH001 London Heathrow (2200 dep) to Kuala Lumpur. Minus points: 1) This was nowhere near a full flight yet when serving dinner shortly after take-off they quickly ran out of one of the two standard options on offer. 2) The cabin was very cold. I was in the window seat 43K and had no one sat next to me so I turned off all 3 vents and used to blankets despite wearing 3 layers including my hoody with the hood up. Still cold. 3) The in-flight entertainment user interface sorely needs updating - it is slow cumbersome and far from intuitive and there really isn't a need for the old-style dual-hole headphone jacks to be retained. Refer to Dragonair as an example of a modern system. Plus points: 1) Cabin crew friendly as ever MH's true asset. 2) Nice in-flight meals although the dinner option that was left (tuna lasagne) might be considered an acquired taste. 3) Despite criticisms of in-flight entertainment there was ample content and of a wide range. General notes: Contrary to what my notes and scores might suggest I did enjoy this flight and very much looked forward to it - my first flight with MH in 7 years and my first on their A380. But flying with them certainly isn't the experience that it used to be. I had flown on 31 MH flights prior to this and can say that they deserved those Skytrax 5-Star Airline ratings but right now they're not quite there. A simple measure like not running out of certain food on a 2/3 full flight would help as something like that isn't acceptable.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,2,Travelled KL to Adelaide on 11/11/2014. Seats OK but sleep quality poor. Cabin crew polite but impersonable - no warmth or sincerity - travelled Economy Class and I felt that we were made to feel that way. Instead of serving peanuts to passengers first drinks (water/juice) should be served first. Refreshments seemed to take aeons to arrive. Food unappetizing. Breakfast of a chicken/tuna sandwich short of appalling. Toilets were not spruced up during the course of the flight OR if they were poor job was done - they were disgusting by the time the flight approached Adelaide. In short irrespective of fares I will never fly MAS again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew SIN-KUL-HCM-KUL-DXB-KUL-SIN. All economy class. Clean modern planes. Seating on the B737 was a bit tight but the longhaul A330 was quite spacious even for a tall person like me. On all flights the staff were warm friendly and efficient. No request was too much trouble. Food and entertainment were good. MAS seems to have gotten its groove back.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,5,MH726 and MH764 on October 28 2014 from Jakarta to Siem Reap via Kuala Lumpur and flew back to Kuala Lumpur on MH765 on October 30 2014. In essence meal given to us was pretty simple. Simpler than a couple years ago. Pudding was not the fresh one - looked like it was made in a factory. Meal was presented in small box with two options to choose. Drink service was fine. Service given by the cabin crews varied. Some were nice some were not in the mood and some looked unhappy. It seemed there was no set standard. The cabin was clean and in flight entertainment was fine on new B737-800 Series (there was no personal TV on MH726 unfortunately and the cabin looked rather old). On the way back to Jakarta on MH727 on October 31 2014 the flight was very full. Long queues at the gate and flight boarded 40 minutes late.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,7 Nov PVG/KUL/LHR MH389/MH002 the service is very great. But the inflight entertainment needs to improve especial for the music selection.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,2,no,2,SYD-KL-HAN. Extremely disappointed in the MA service. We ordered vegetarian meals on all four flights however there was a huge mix-up and were given everything but vegetarian meals. We called the booking line when we arrived at our destination to make sure that our meals were vegetarian on the way back. They confirmed that they would be. We got on our return flight and we were only served one vegetarian meal and one meal with meat. We spoke to the air hostess who said it was our fault because we didn't order a vegetarian meal with our booking. This was incorrect. Treating us as hindrances rather than being accommodating or apologetic the attendant offered the staff meal which was vegetarian slop served cold. As you can imagine we were extremely unimpressed. Further the MA planes are dated and seating is uncomfortable. The attendants don't clean the toilets throughout the flight so the floors were wet and the toilets smelt. Hands down the worst four flights of my life and will never fly MA again.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I recently flew from Tokyo to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur with Malaysian in Business Class. The whole experience was great well organised boarding smart attentive crew who really seemed to enjoy their job-unlike many European airlines when you seem to be an inconvenience to the crew. The meals served on both sectors were the best I had ever experienced in Business Class and I have flown on some of the big players in Europe and the USA. I was. Pleased to see the flight full and will be using Malaysian whenever possible in the future.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,,3,no,6,Flew MH143 from SYD-KUL early in October in economy. The meal service was a very small portion. I was surprised to find that the second meal was just a pastry and a beverage! The return leg was the same - breakfast was another pastry. I often fly SYD-SIN-KUL with another airline and get two full meals on the long sector. This time I chose to support MH following the two recent disasters. I truly wish the airline a very prosperous future but inflight catering must be improved.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Mumbai to Siem Reap Via KL and back in economy. We managed to do a seat reservation all the way so we got the seats we wanted. Strangely the website would not let me do this and finally I called the office in Mumbai and they did the same for us. Flight from BOM to KUL was uneventful as its a night flight. Food served after take off and was quite awful. The BOM to KUL route is served by what seems like a very tired and old 777 and the 2-5-2 seating is great if you booked the 2 but seemed crammed for the rest. Leg room good. PTV options okay. From KUL to REP the flights were on a 737. Lunch served- once again the food was terrible. Staff and service all the way through was okay - nothing outstanding. Packed flight on all 4 sectors. Main reason for choosing MAS was the price was the cheapest way to get to Cambodia from India.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,MH143 on 7/10/2014. Just flew KL to Sydney. Service food and inflight entertainment were excellent. Flight was 100% full. Will definitely continue to support MAS.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,KUL-ADL return out on 18 Oct and return on 25 Oct. Outbound flight was a red eye. On the outbound sector service was generally good albeit a little perfunctory by a male flight attendant who was occasionally a little rushed and gruff. Otherwise the rest of the staff were great. In contrast to previous journeys there was no rush to get the meal service over. There was a good choice of wine and spirits. Inflight entertainment was extensive but not to my liking but that's a personal choice. They supply you with a duvet pillows and a rather sad amenity bag which is embarrassingly cheap and tacky (apart from the creams and moisturizers). The seat is angled flat and is terrible for sleep. I am 183 cm tall and was constantly sliding down and ended up setting the chair at an armchair recline to try and get some sleep. The return flight was great just 6 people in business class so there was lots of attention and the attendants were truly warm and friendly . They got it right in that they were unobtrusive but yet managed to keep their eye on your glass and plate offering second helpings of food and topping up wine regularly. I used the book-the-cook service and my main meal of nasi lemak was just okay nothing special. Bear in mind that nasi lemak out of Adelaide is not to be recommended! Generally I was quite satisfied apart from the angled-flat seats. MAS do something about these seats in your A330's!
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew 18 Oct MH127 KUL-PER. Got lucky by the airline upgrade program and sat on business class 1st row. Food was plentiful and entertainment system was full with many latest movies. Temperature in the cabin were a bit too low. The journey was smooth throughout but the landing was rough. The weather at airport was bad and with the pilot aborted landing at 1st attempt. Loud applause could be heard when the pilot landed the plane safely after 2nd attempt. As a frequent flyer this was a memorable experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew MAS on 1st September Penang to Kuala Lumpur and then Kuala Lumpur to Kuching. Price was reasonable and cheaper than AirAsia surprisingly. Check-in was alright. Food was nice. Only peanut and fruit juice were served on flight from Penang to KL but I think it's sufficient for a short flight. Took only 25 minutes for the flight to fly from Penang to KL. I noticed they no longer produce their own peanut butter it's now supplied by a Malaysian company unrelated to MAS. The only complaint on this flight was the extremely rough landing. Flight from KL to Kuching was nice. Flight attendants were nice. Choice of food was either frittata or nasi lemak. Frittata was not served hot sadly and the potato wedges were soggy. Besides that I have no other complaints. MAS may be going through a difficult time but it is coping well in my opinion. I'll definitely fly MAS again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Melbourne - Frankfurt (Return). The flights to Germany were actually quite good. Was in a Boeing 777-200 and while the plane was probably a little old the seats were comfortable with good leg room and entertainment was fine. Flights ran on time and service was professional and attentive. I will say that that the fact that the flight was not full helped as I was able to get two seats to myself. With food an important point to realise is that the food is usually made and loaded onto the plane at the departure point. So the Melbourne - KL food was good but the food from KL to FRA was fairly ordinary. On the way back FRA to KL was fine but the KL to Melbourne flight was pretty bad. Service was poor and sloppy food was dreadful seats uncomfortable (expected given it was an airbus). It seemed to be more of a code share flight as most passengers were Sri Lanka Airlines and KLM passengers connecting to Melbourne. Would fly again but choose my flights a bit more carefully next time. Not as good as it was about 18 months ago but standards haven't fallen away that much. I left in September and came back in October yet had the same entertainment program on outbound and inbound which wasn't too pleasing given long hauls involved.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,5,yes,10,Was on board MH2047 SDK-BKI on 17 Oct 2014. Was a 737-800 not a full flight. FA was great. Drinks was serve twince. IFE was so- so as not headphone was gived. USB Port was not in working condition. Flight took off and landed early. KKIA was like a dead town - peace and quiet.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,BKK-KUL-SIN-KUL-SIN in Business. Great value for money. Service from check-in staff and on-board was just excellent.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Flew MH31 IST to KLIA 11/10/14 then MH135 to BNE. Flights on time. Service and all crew excellent. Good food and beverage. This airline is really trying. We could not have had better or easier flights.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,3,KUL-KTM 9 Oct MH 114. Below average service from the FA and disgusting food. It took them an hour and a half after takeoff to serve meals and there was no turbulence to delay it. Platinum status not acknowledged as well as names not used at all by the unfriendly lead stewardess and her crew. It's a pity the way this once great airline is headed.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,SGN-KUL-SGN on 11-12 October 2014. There were very few passengers on the first flight (Boeing 737-800) 5 in business and approx. 15 in economy. Second flight were full in economy due to a large Malaysian sports team Service and FA in business was top notch in both directions! Special meal provided perfectly food options available wine-list and champagne though the flight lasts 1½hour only. Real business seats in old solid style (reclining). IFE and headphones worked fine. Tables are small and not very stable. KUL Malaysia Airlines' Golden Satay Lounge in KUL is airy spacious and very good. Space for approx. 250 pax I slept there overnight in the Relaxation Room (4 beds) had shower and local hot food (some 3 dishes offered) MH is still bleeding as there is only very few persons in the lounge partly because of weekend. This airline deserves to survive with glamour and is on par with QR and EK.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,KUL-CDG (Paris) A380-800 Upper Deck (31 August 2014) LHR (London)-KUL A380-800 Upper Deck (7 September 2014). Very good service for both route. But a bit delay on arrival to Kuala Lumpur from London. Inflight entertainment should be upgraded.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,"We flew from KL to SYD earlier this week and were very disappointed with the staff. We checked in and were told we were being given a bassinet seat for our 10 month old when we boarded we realised it wasn't a bassinet seat but was the second last row in the cabin. When we raised this with the flight attendants they were not helpful at all and said it was the ""ground staff"" that we had to talk to - this is after we had boarded. Eventually they decided to call the ground staff after all the passengers had boarded so they could sort it out. When we spoke to the ground staff we were told that we were given incorrect information and that we were supposed to check our seats (I don't know how we are meant to know where our seats are allocated). He said there wasn't anything they could do and that we had to sit at the seat without the bassinet for the 9-hour flight unless we asked whether anyone was willing to swap seats with us. They refused to talk to the passengers and find a seat for us. I will never be travelling with this airline again and was very disappointed with their service."
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,My husband and I flew London - Phuket in September and returned in October. We thought both flights were great. The staff were really friendly and were more than happy to help with any issues we had. Had no complaints at all.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,1,no,2,"MAS is truly an airline that has lost its way. For long-haul they used to be a byword for comfort and good service with their old 747s having a greater-than-average seat pitch. Since taking delivery of their A380s this has all changed for the worse. Seats are now as crammed-in as with almost all airlines but worse still are actually uncomfortable to sit on. Cabin service is far worse with many staff appearing to wish they were anywhere but on duty with MAS. Meal quality is mediocre except for special meals that are generally good. Added to all this are very high fares and what I regularly find to be the worst and most unworkable website of all the airlines I have used in the electronic ticket age. ""MH"" is supposed to mean ""Malaysian Hospitality"" - but the Malaysian government might like to lean on this airline to make this a realistic claim if they really want people to visit Malaysia. Sorry MAS but you are a once-good now poor airline."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,MH127 KUL-PER 3 Oct. The flight was full. No empty seats. Excellent service by flight crews. The crews looked tired but that didn't impact the overall service. Only setback was the cabin aircon was not working when boarding. The ground power supply wasn't working. The temperature in the cabin were too hot. The plane departed 15 minutes late. Otherwise overall service was excellent will fly again on MH.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,10th Sept MH134 BNE to KUL then 11th Sept MH004 KUL to LHR. We fly annually with MAS to Europe. Earlier this month we flew BNE to LHR changing aircraft at KUL. Cabin crew were better than ever. On the A330 they now supply a slipover quilt which stops any sliding on the angled seat. Crew clearly worried about retrenchments in the current environment. Our flights were excellent in every way. I hope the public give MAS the support it deserves.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,Two flights from Amsterdam to Manila. First flight to Kuala Lumpur MH19. Flight was comfortable staff were very friendly and helpful. Food was nice as far as plane food goes. Aircraft is getting a little old but it didn't effect the comfort. Second connection flight was MH806. The plane was modern and comfortable. Food was okay and staff were friendly. Biggest compliment I could pay is how professional the staff are.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,,,4,no,5,"I am a frequent flyer with Malaysian Airlines and have been loyal to them during this last year but standards seem to be slowly declining. Yesterday I took the midday flight from London to KL. I declined a glass of wine with my lunch as it was too early in the day for me but a few hours later I fancied a drink so I went to the back of the upper deck and requested one. The flight attendant was preparing soft drinks and refused me any alcohol. ""It's finished"" she snapped. Is this a new policy? Also the air quality was noticeably poor. Maybe that's why the flight attendant was so grouchy."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,1,Used Malaysia Airlines to fly from Amsterdam to Denpasar return. The return flight was 2 hours late very little updated information from Kuala Lumpur. The food and the service was poor. The service compared with other airlines I flew before was nothing special. Very disappointed.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew from London to Kuala Lumpur in August I have always flown MAS. Another great flight on time both ways. I only have praises for the very friendly and pleasant cabin crew. Drinks were served every hour and the food as fantastic. Inflight entertainment was great.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew Brisbane to London via KL - return with Malaysian airlines and was more than happy with every aspect of the experience both on the A330 and the A380. I look forward to flying with them again as soon as possible.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Just flew Adelaide/KL/Singapore with Malaysia Airlines and couldn't have been happier. Flights were great friendly efficient staff good meals and entertainment. With all the problems Malaysia Airlines have suffered this year I hope they keep flying. We will certainly book with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,2,no,2,I regularly fly Malaysia Airlines and am usually pleased with their service but this time the abysmal service on my Bangalore-Kuala Lumpur flight needs reporting. I was placed on a seat in front of an exit row and was horrified to find the seat couldn't recline at all! To make matters worse the seat pitch was no different to some budget airline like Ryanair! Imagine being mashed up for 4 hours in a seat that wont recline while the seat in front of you is reclined all the way for 4 hours! By the end of the flight I was exhausted as it was so uncomfortable that I was unable to sleep squashed into the tiny seat with the TV screen mashed up to my face (meaning I couldn't watch anything without hurting my eyes). My back and neck still hurt even though it has been a day now. For those who are wondering I bought a full service Class L economy ticket not one of the ultra cheap H or K tickets so at the very least I should not have been stuck in such a seat! From now on I shall fly Singapore Airlines to Bangalore even though it means that I have to transit in Changi.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Melbourne-KL-Bangkok return in economy. Flight from Melbourne to Kl was the 12.05 departure. A chicken roll with spicy relish was served as supper and a breakfast of continental or nasi lemak was served prior to landing in KL. On the flight from Kl to Bangkok a chicken roll was served with a piece of cake. I would rate the food as average there was nothing that stood out or was out standing. Staff were excellent and friendly and meal service was very efficient. My request for a scotch and coke was fulfilled promptly. Toilets were kept clean at all times. Cabin announcements were kept to a minimum to allow sleep. Seats were comfortable for economy with ample leg room. Good choice of movies and TV shows. On the return flight from KL to Melbourne a dinner was served of curry chicken with salad and sticky date pudding. This was by far the best meal our of all the planes. Plane was an older model so seats didn't recline but luckily plane wasn't full so could stretch out. Breakfast was a very bland chicken roll saw a lot of people have a bite and leave it aside. Service once again excellent. Overall a good experience the fares were about $400 cheaper than Thai and almost the same as Air Asia. I have flown them many times and the service is always without fault. All flights were full or close to full and left and arrived on time.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,We did a Business Class flight from Frankfurt to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur. The Chef-On Call service worked perfectly and the food was good in quality and taste. The staff were very friendly and always smiled. Each flight was operated with a Boeing 777-200. The seat were are good but not the newest ones. Unfortunately not fully flat when you want to sleep but still we could sleep about 8 hours non stop without disturbance and wake up relaxed. The onboard entertainment system is not the newest system anymore and did not offer a good range of movies. I have seen much betters in other airlines. But it worked without any issues. The service before the flight is great. All my requests were fulfilled and I received a reply on my emails within 12 hours usually.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,KUL-JED-KUL MH150 and MH151. It was a fantastic trip for me and my family. The cabin crew were very friendly and attentive. The food were delicious. The IFE also very good with many choices of movies. I will definitely fly with Malaysia Airlines again in the future.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,5,MH122 (SYD-KUL A330-300) MH758 (KUL-SGN B737-800) MH765 (REP-KUL B737-800) MH141 (KUL-SYD A330-300) Business Class August/September. Despite their travails over the past months Malaysia still rates with the best the cabins were full both to KL and Saigon only 5 pax (out of 16 seats) from Siem Reap and 17 pax (out of 42 to Sydney). Check-in was hassle free at all locations with lounge access after border protection and security (note MH now use the QF Business Class lounge at SYD rather than their own lounge down in the bowels of Kingsford Smith). There was no priority boarding at KUL or REP but once on board service was exemplary on all sectors with friendly and attentive crews the exception was REP-KUL (2 flight attendants for 5 pax but no teamwork or co-operation rapid meal service CSM spent most of the flight reading his paper and no priority landing passes which meant almost 30 minutes to clear immigration at KUL - not good). Food and beverage was good with tasty meals the satay is always a winner and a good wine selection (interestingly wine wasn't offered with the 'lite meal' served before landing - dinner time - but available if requested however they embarrassingly ran out of all white wine on the SYD-KUL sector). The standard of catering on the two short sectors was astonishingly good. My only complaint would be that the meals were rushed when a more leisurely pace would have suited the time of day.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,Flew Malaysia Airlines recently on KUL-LHR-KUL on their flagship A380. Upper deck was a breeze and seats food and IFE was on par with the likes of the competitors. Crew were friendly pleasant and offered juice/drinks consistently every hour. Flight was slightly longer due to the new flight path which took longer than usual. The loads on KUL-LHR was 100% full and LHR-KUL was 90%. Transfer between Terminal 4 and Terminal 5 was a breeze at LHR. Good flight and excellent crew like always. Keep up the positive spirit.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,5,yes,6,Flew domestic route Kota Kinabalu - Kuala Lumpur return with B737-800 (90-95% passengers load) and international Kuala Lumpur - Melbourne with A330 (60-70 % passengers load). I would said positive points were smooth check in on time flight welcoming cabin crews and good legroom. But I think MH needs some improvements with certain aspects if still want to stay in line with other legacy airlines such as SQ CX QR EK. These are things such as: food services. For instance for domestic 2.5 hr flight it is not reasonable to be served refreshments only. My meal from MEL-KUL was a tasteless nasi lemak. IFE was very good but would better if they have Malay subtitles for non Malay language movies. Otherwise satisfied with MH in general.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,yes,7,AKL-KUL-AKL (1 July and 18 July 2014) on the Boeing 777-200. The seats were very comfortable and the legroom was wide for an economy class. In terms of food I prefer the one from KUL as it is catered by Brahim's instead of the food that was catered at AKL's catering. The screen of the IFE was a too small in the 777 I hardly enjoyed the movies and expected to have more choices. However the audio on demand was up to date they have the latest album of my favorite singers. Cabin crew was friendly and they provided a very good service to all passengers.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,ICN-KUL A330 code share with Korean 8/26. It has been many years since I traveled with MH but considering the recent events I had no qualms about this trip. The price and flight schedules were right. Two FA seems sad and about to cry during the flight for some reasons. The rest were fine and professional. Service and food were okay. Flight left and landed on time luggage was present at the end of the trip. My section was 50-60% full mainly locals. I would fly with them again but will see how the recently announced cuts affect service.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,2,no,,My husband flew from Perth to Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo to Los Angeles. When we got seated on the plane in Perth we had to use wipes to clean the surface in front of us and our tables as they were filthy. When we got seated on the plane at Kuala Lumpur we sat there for approximately in a hot plane without taking off for about thirty minutes then advised there was a technical problem and they were waiting for an engineer. We then sat in the hot plane for about another half an hour and not even offered a drink of water. Passengers had to go into the service areas and ask the hostesses for a drink. I understand planes do have problems from time to time but to not even be offered a drink. After about another half an hour we had to get off this plane and get onto another one. On the flights to Tokyo and the following one to Los Angeles the meals were disgusting and we are not fussy eaters at all but couldn't eat the meals. Also on these flights the rubbish incurred by the passengers was not once collected. On the ten hour flight Tokyo to Los Angeles we did not get one cup of tea or coffee. Every time it was time for tea or coffee they said they couldn't serve it because of impending turbulence which we are still waiting for. We flew home from Rome to Perth with Emirates and experienced a lot of turbulence but still received our tea and coffee. We were a bit hesitant going with Malaysian Airlines after the disappearance of their aircraft but did think they would go out of their way and offer a very good service but not to be. We will never fly with them again because of the dirty inedible food and shocking service on their flights.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,KUL-SIN Sunday noon departure. Online booking and check-in is easy enough with an added bonus of being able to drop off bags at the City Air Terminal at KL Sentral before boarding the airport train. After that it's a little disorganized. Boarding time is advertised far too early making passengers wait half outside the gate area for a second security screening and only then getting to wait with proper seating. The staff was OK though none too friendly. They handed out peanuts and drinks and that was it. I didn't mind choosing MH over similarly priced competition nor was the trip in any way memorable. Average in general.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,no,5,BKK-KUL-SYD-KUL-BKK. For the first leg BKK-KUL the flight was flown with a B737-800 and the leg room was comparable to a budget airline! Not quite what I expected! Food was just okay but it's just a short flight so nothing to complain about. The second leg KUL-SYD was excellent. Attentive and polite cabin crew for an overnight flight and the food was one of the best I've had. Flight arrived earlier than scheduled which was commendable. The return flight SYD-KUL was quite full and the cabin crew seems a little short tempered. My request for water was being brushed away by 1 cabin crew and the second cabin crew replied in a not so polite tone. I noticed that the crew was more friendly to non-Asians and I did not get a single smile from the 2 cabin crew that was tending to my row of seats. Food was great as usual but not the cabin crew. The last leg KUL-BKK was cancelled a few days before the flight and I was put to a flight the next morning about 11 hours away from the original flight. I had to book a room at the transit hotel at KLIA to spend the night. No compensation was made not even a free upgrade to Business Class. Again cabin crew put on long faces. If given a chance I would avoid flying with Malaysia Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew LHR-KL-LHR on the A380 economy section of upper deck on both legs. The seats are comfortable enough but leg- room is still somewhat restricted. The cabin crew were attentive there were drinks brought around every hour during the flight. The food was standard airline fare but coming out of KL there was little choice it was 'spicy' or nothing - so I had nothing. Having said that most other passengers seemed to find something to eat. The upper deck is a pleasant experience it feels more spacious in economy because of the fewer number of seats. My main complaint would be the temperature it was bitterly cold initially with many passengers wrapped in blankets and coats. Surprisingly there was no amenity pack of any description in economy.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,KUL-LHR. Long 12 hour flight was slightly delayed. Nothing but praise for Malaysian airlines. Fantastic crew who did their job to the best ability. The Inflight entertainment on the A380 is the best I have experienced 200+ movies how could anyone get bored on a flight like that? Food was good too.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,KUL-KCH MH2520 19 August 2014. KCH-KUL MH2521 22 August 2014. Outbound flight almost half empty seats. Overall experience from the food IFE and crew services in term of friendliness is excellent. Inbound flight with less empty seats is similar to the outbound flight with the exception of cold sandwiches that were served to the passengers the overall experience is truly 5 star for 1.5 hour domestic flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,3,My partner and I flew from Kuala Lumpur to Sydney on August 21st. I found the food very ordinary and the Vegetable rolls are awful. I was so hungry after being awake all-night due to a child in the seat behind me continually kicking the back of my partners seat. The service is also average which is unfortunate. I spilt water all over me and looked for someone to help me maybe grab me a towel or something. I waited until an attendant came into view. I waved to him and smiled to let him know I needed him. He stood there looking at me then turned away. Totally ignored me. He eventually came. By the time he decided to come I had used the blanket to wipe up all the water. Not happy at all with service. I really would like to see airlines group families together a bit separate from adults traveling with no children and I feel it is really unfair to be kept awake all night and inconvenienced by badly behaved children. I can not see me flying Malaysia Airlines again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,4,no,5,How standards have slipped on MAS! Flew Brisbane-KUL on 15/08 and was on MAS again after using a number of other airlines for frequent trips up to S.E.Asia. We were not able to get the seats we requested and ended up way down the back. IF entertainment was limited and not all advertised choices were available. The food was terrible with 'dinner' being a small strip pie even the staff apologized when I questioned what they had served up to us. Breakfast was a little better. Drinks had to be requested and was limited to 2 serves only. Staff then retreated to their area and we're hardly seen for the rest of the flight. It is easy to see where MAS is heading but sad to see what was once a great airline drop its standards so much.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,KUL-CDG. A380 was good and flight was filled to the brim. I'm not a big fan of the hard seats but it wasn't hard to get a good night sleep. One of the 2 stewardess weren't very attentive and could have done better while the other one was fantastic. Food is great as usual and they offered drinks on several rounds. Check In is done via a kiosk now so things are faster.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew CGK-KUL-CGK on MH710 and MH727 with their brand new B738. both flight departed and arrived on time. Flight service was great with courteous flight attendants and comfortable cabin. However they seem to cut expenses by offering much smaller inflight meals but still okay for the 2-hour flight. The main highlight of the trip was check in facility in KLIA Express station at KL Central which is really efficient and convenient. I paid MYR 35 for 30-minutes train to KLIA and was able to check in and check my baggage there at the station. Overall a pleasant experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,"KUL-CDG-KUL seated on A380 upper deck for both legs. Both flights left on time. Service provided by FAs and ground staff was friendly helpful and courteous. Never heard a rude word uttered or given any dirty looks as commented by some of the other reviewers. IFE was adequate and contained ample media to listen/read/watch. Late supper and breakfast were served hot on both flights and were quite tasty. Snack boxes were handed out mid flight with FAs serving drinks nearly every hour throughout the flight. Snacks and drinks were also readily available for selection in the rear galley area. On to the minor negative comments. Though there was plenty of legroom our seats were very stiff and hard on this 388. Hard to sleep on for long haul flights if you're even able to sleep at all. My previous flights on the MH 772s and 744s had much comfy-er seats than this plane. The seat back pockets and also additional window seat storage had food crumbs and dried ""goo"" and needed a good vacuum and wipe."
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,7,Just flown MEL-KUL-CDG in business class. 777 on first leg to KL then A380 to CDG and back then A330 from KL to Mel. 777 is spacious. Business class was pretty busy but economy was so quiet - this leg was a week after MH17. A380 is superb - I was in the front section on the upper deck both ways and it was so quiet. A330 is cramped and uncomfortable to sleep. IFE not the best and I am glad I flew in different months as the movies weren't the best. Food was pretty average but service was as always really good. That's always been the standout feature of Malaysian and in the face of everything that has happened their staff are still the most helpful in the skies.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,I flew from Auckland to Kuala Lumpur then to Paris. All nice flights saved up for business class which was nice too. The staff were good. Food and entertainment were good. The seat was excellent. All in all a good flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew FRA-MNL-FRA. First leg delayed (3 hrs) because they had to change an tyre. The seats are a bit hard and overused on the 777 but I choose them because of the 34 inch seats and legroom. The food was ok and the cabin crew very professional. Flight to and from MNL was in a new 737/800 and everything was ok. Flight back to FRA was on time food and crew ok. It is now the 5th consecutive year that I have taken MAS. In future I will still choose MAS because of their service legroom good prices and the short stop in KUL.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,MH 795 Aug 4th HKT-KUL 25F MH 135 Aug 5th KUL-BNE 37F MH 134 Aug 6th BNE-KUL 37F MH 786 Aug 7th KUL- HKT 11A. Positives: Good IFE. Expected on long-haul above par for regional flights. B738 and A333 both less than 2y old. On-time dep and arr. Food for Economy ok. Price USD 350 less than SIA and even better than most LCC. Good value for money. Negatives: KUL-BNE flight freezing cold cabin. Apprx 70% of passengers were shivering wearing blankets and jackets. Asked to pls increase temperature. Nothing happened. One particular staff member argumentative patronizing and confrontational. Took forever to get to speak to Cabin Manager but once he intervened issue was sorted out amicably. Nevertheless caught a cold since this was 4hrs after initially addressing the issue. On MH 135 AirShow not working window shades pulled down and no announcements made from cockpit. In light of recent events I find it rather insensitive of MAS not to understand the need to keep passengers informed. Upon request the clearly annoyed First Officer announced we were just passing Alice Springs. Cockpit crew really should communicate more with the cabin especially if AirShow is INOP.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Flight from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur. Unfortunately we experienced a delay while already in the plane because of high traffic at HK airport. The FA's immediately started distributing drinks and peanuts. The flight overall was a pleasant one with friendly and pro-active service and good food. I'm not a big fan of the 737-800 though. The older 777's that they also operate on this route are in my view much more comfortable.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,KUL-TPE-KUL outbound on 1st Aug 2014 and inbound on 5 Aug 2014. B737-800 were being used for both sectors seat pitch was OK IFE was excellent food and beverages were great and the crew members were attentive and serve to perfection. Thumbs up for MAS!
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,3,no,4,We all know this airline has had unfortunate problems however this does not excuse the tardy service well was it even service on two sectors London to Kuala Lumpur and Kuala Lumpur to Auckland in July. For a 5 star airline both my wife and I were very disappointed. We flew the day after the Ukraine disaster the cabin crew on both legs looked for want of a better word 'tired'. We were served very quickly on the London - KL leg the cabin shut down and then left to our own devices. There was not a crew member to be found a couple of times that I wandered back to the galley. In fact there was not even any water or juice left out for us to help ourselves to nor was there as with Cathay on our trip over a cabin attendant roughly every hour bringing water juice and snacks around. The same happened on the KL Auckland flight. I also found the inflight entertainment disappointing especially on the second leg where the screen was not performing well nor would either my wife's or my hand piece retract into the seat arm. If this is 5 star service then it must only be in the front of the aircraft or did we have an unfortunate couple of flights? I hope the latter!
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,MH is superb in the skies and lousy on the ground. SYD-KL-DEL. Excellent FAs and service. Planes neat and tidy. On the ground its a sad story. City offices in Delhi and Sydney seem to consider customers an unwelcome sight and an insufferable burden. Phone calls go unanswered and the ticketing agent in Sydney had a zonked look on her face and hustled me along. There are others waiting. Rude reservations staff in Sydney. in Delhi the doorman answered the phone after a good 2 minute wait to tell me everyone was out at lunch and I should call later. The call made later were never answered. The next day an over enthusiastic officer who seemed to have been high on something returned my call and was raring to go. I will definitely fly MH and ask my friends to support the airline in these trying times but MH need to get their act together landside.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Several regional sectors SIN-KUL-DPS-KUL-SIN KUL-SGN-KUL in Economy as well as KUL-BKK in Business July 2014 on their 737 and 777. All flights full all flights on time and all flights from pleasant to excellent. MH offered two choices of hot meals with beverages on all flights (more options in Business) the food always tasty their cabin service good to excellent and the aircraft in good condition. The 777's are clearly showing their age with dated IFE but the 34-inch seat pitch is wonderful compared to the cramped 737's. Moreover the generous 30 kg baggage allowance was one good reason for booking MH long haul as well as regional flights. Great value and good service all the way - will surely book MH in the future as well.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Flew 787-800 - Colombo to Kuala Lumpur - Return. Good airline with courteous staff. Flight was fine. I found the seats to be surprisingly uncomfortable which is unusual as I am normally happy sitting anywhere. Not a massive problem though as I dropped off to sleep anyway. The 787-800 is a great little aircraft so no problems there. MAS use it regularly around Asia on short haul flights. Great little workhorse. Would I say they were 5 star? Based on just on this trip no however I would need to fly long haul to have a better opinion. I would recommend them and would fly again.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew LHR to KUL and on to BKK. LHR leg on MH3. A wonderful flight on spacious A380 upper deck forward section plenty of open space around seats rather than pod like structures. Toilet was the only airline toilet I can comfortably fit in. Staff attentive and Captain announced there were 2 flight crews. Flight fully booked and they were offering economy passengers €600 to travel on the later flight that day interconnects taken care of and a day hotel too. A great bargain. The check in desk told me the flight is always full. Lounge not wonderful though. Food just ok but cramped when carrying hand baggage and seats that do not move. Poor uk newspaper selection and none on the plane. Aircraft certainly recommended. Food on flight and wines really good. The entertainment system had a great screen but quirky interface. If you want in flight info you have to use a mouse cursor hard to see and imprecise whereas all other screens do not. The movies were not as up to date as some airlines but certainly plenty of choice and adequate. My wife's screen hung a couple of times but later reverted to where it left off. The staff were superb. Change at KUL was a shuttle train away and somewhat complex with plenty of walking and having been given no information on the plane you were left to your own devices looking for info screens the first a distance from getting off and with only an hour between flights the luggage did not make it to BKK. An hour was a bare minimum gap between flights for me let alone my luggage. There were no complications such as going through security beyond a hand baggage X-ray at the gate. I guess unloading a plane the size of an A380 takes longer and priority luggage seemed not to help its passage. However a Thai air rep approached us as at the baggage carousel in BKK so we did not have to wait until the last bag came off. We were told the luggage would follow 4 hours later and it was efficiently delivered to our hotel that evening fully wrapped and sealed. The hotel knew the process so presumably commonplace. By comparison the leg to BKK felt dated and so small and we had another breakfast. This time the toilet was so small I did not even attempt it. All in all despite the snags detailed I recommend Malaysia and especially the A380. It is very quiet spacious and felt new (which of course it is).
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew BNE-KL-BOM. A330 from BNE-KL - fairly empty flight. Staff were a little older very pleasant. So much food. Seats were comfortable enough. It was a late PM flight so I was keen to sleep. I couldn't get comfortable on the lie flat bed - I felt like I was slipping down. I managed a few hours and then got woken up for a really early breakfast (again lots of food). Plane was new and fresh. It was an old plane between KL/Mumbai - and delayed due to an electronics issue. It was like a domestic business seat. Not much space! From Mumbai - KL it was a 777-200 - much better with much more space! KL-BNE was A330 again. Pretty much the same experience except it was a daytime flight so ZERO chance of any sleep. Again food was good and abundant. Won't fly them again despite my good experience. I was pretty uptight on the flight home - watching us move past all the volcanic ash by flying right down the west coast of Australia (safety first).
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,1,"Jakarta-KL-Guangzhou on 22/07/2014 went smoothly. Cabin food and staff were good average. On the way back we flew from Hong Kong to KL morning flight at 8.45am. It was on time. Entered the cabin and was met by a very sullen tired and bored looking stewardess. Cabin looked filthy. Pillows were scattered on my seat and on the floor. Table had some sort of dried stain. The seat cover in front of us was dirty. Nothing babywipes couldn't wipe clean so why didn't whoever was in charge of cleaning the cabin do so? A child tried to go to toilet while a stewardess was distributing food. Blocked by her cart the boy waited for her to move. Immediately she barked ""Where do you want to go?"" The boy looked surprised and pointed at the toilet behind her. She then moved the cart to the side a bit with a terribly bored look on her face and signed for the boy to squeeze through. Not even a smile or the kindness and patience expected from FA. From KL we flew connecting flight to Jakarta. Aircraft looked old and tired. No IFE at all. We had IFE on the flight from Jakarta to KL two weeks before but not today. It was a 1 hour and 45 mins flight with nothing to do but eat and sleep. Needless to say in the future I will try my best to avoid this airline. The cheaper price doesn't justify their bad attitude."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,no,1,Flown from Singapore to Frankfurt with stop over in KL on July 20th. The flight was the most uncomfortable I have had for a long haul flight. The crews were not the happiest the plane was old with the smallest screen I have seen with a small selection of movies. The seat was uncomfortable run down toilets and dirty. I don't think I will fly MH again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,KUL-ICN-KUL A330 economy. Overall satisfied. Most of the crews were helpful and professional yet it seems like some crews need further improvement. In flight meals were quite good on both flights. IFE system was better than I expected. There was a wide range of music and movies. Comfortable seat with decent leg room for medium-haul flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,5,3/7/2014 MH 134. 4/7/2014 MH 072. 14/7/2014 MH 433. 15/7/2014 MH 135. The food on the flight from Brisbane to KL was very disappointing also the drink selection was very limited on all legs of our trip to Hong Kong. Overall the experience was fair.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,no,1,Let me say that passengers who don't have infants and toddlers should not have these problems. We (my wife my 2yr old son and my 6 month old daughter) travelled to Asia from Australia. Everything went fairly well on our way from Australia to Malaysia. We were allowed 3 pieces of hand luggage and 4 pieces of main luggage. Almost all of our hand luggage was full of essential items. When we land in Malaysia for the transit and are about to board the connecting flight we were told that we cannot take 3 pieces of hand luggage onboard as its a smaller flight. We had paid for 3 seats and a bassinet. However after arguing with the ground staff for 10 minutes they still would not let us take the last hand luggage in with us. When we got onboard the flight wasn't full. To add to the misery they had allocated seats for us in completely different places leaving my 2 year old by himself my wife in a completely different section by herself and me with my 6 month old in another section! When I complained to the on-board crew they said that they were unable to help and that I'd have to speak to the passengers of the area where I wished to be seated and swap seats with them. Our return flight wasn't the best either. No bassinet for the complete journey although we had fully paid and confirmed a month ahead of our journey. The excuse was that there were 9 infants on board and only 5 bassinets. My poor wife had to hold our 6 month old for over 12 hours in a cramped seat! At one point my 2 year old was getting unsettled so I asked one of the stewardesses if they have any toys or kids activity books to keep my son occupied/entertained. She disappeared for about 15 minutes and came back with 4 packets of peanuts! Never again will I fly Malaysia Airlines.

,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,4,no,5,Flew with MAS from LHR to SYD and back. First on A380 which was cosy then on B747 which was old and dated. Seats were uncomfortable and staff were really rude. Nothing compared to SQ. Food was woeful and not enough cabin staff to serve. Won't fly with them again.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Perth - Kuala Lumpur - Beijong return June 28 flew back July 12. Last minute upgrades to business class (Maximum 2 hours before flight you can book for most flights if they have seats) at a 66% discount was well worth the money. My champagne glass was never empty Head stewardess personally greeted me by name at the start of the flight and thanked me for flying with Malaysia Airlines just before landing. Was asked whether I wanted to be woken for breakfast which I appreciated. Meals and entertainment was first Class. Could not sleep well on the angled flat seats but others slept fine. 22 hour layover in KL on way out and 8 hours on way in. Airport Hotel for both layovers were given without having to ask.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,5,no,6,Flew SYD-KUL-SYD. We have flown MH a few times over the years. Sadly service levels have declined. The disposable covers on the pillows looked like they haven't been changed in months. They are meant to be white but were actually yellow. My daughters tray was dirty and all staff could say was 'that's not our issue that's a cleaning issue so just complain when you get there'! Food was very average on both flights and much less food served than normal. My kids were very hungry. I do not recommend ordering children's meals. IFE was OK but could improve. Faulty headphones both flights. Seat did not recline on SYD/KUL flight. There were less cabin crew than usual and they were not very attentive. Definitely not on par with SQ or CX anymore. Only good thing were the seats which made for a comfortable flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,5,yes,5,BKK (Bangkok)2 to SYD (Sydney) via KUL (Kuala Lumpur). Travelled on a whim as the flights were so cheap. Used to travel on MH a lot 20 years ago and they used to be excellent. BKK to KUL on 737 had surly staff a tiny croissant and no coffee. IFE guide featured latest Hollywood releases but the system only had Bollywood movies. Seat was OK. Flight on time. KUL to SYD on A330 was only 30% capacity yet the service was still very slow and not very friendly. No drink rounds were offered. Food was reasonable but on the small side. Seat had plenty of room and many customers had 4 seats to lie on. SYD to KUL 100% full A330. Service was as good as the earlier virtually empty flight. Staff looked harried as if they had to meet a deadline yet they were so slow One flight attendant looked as if she were about to cry. Food again reasonable. KUL to BKK on 737. Faster service and friendly staff. With very good fares and a 30kg baggage allowance I will fly MH again But they fall short on this run compared to Qantas or Emirates.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,SIN-KUL-NARITA (MH 610 MH 88). NARITA-KUL-SIN (MH 89 MH 607). I travelled solo for this return trip on 16 July and 26 July. Boarding was organized and smooth. Throughout my flights the cabin maintained cool conditions smelt great and it also helped that the seats were comfortable which allowed me to catch needful sleep especially on my red-eye flight in MH 88. I must commend the cabin crew on my flights as they were nothing less than professional and friendly ensuring I got what I wanted although I noticed that one had to ask for beverages and they don't do rounds along the aisle to check on passengers during off-service times. The food wasn't the best I have tasted inflight but that was fine with me - had the Nasi Lemak on MH 88 and seafood pasta on MH 89. I wouldn't hesitate to travel on Malaysia Airlines again!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,2,"LHR-KUL-Bali and return. Part on A380. My husband and I fly long haul regularly with close family living in Australia. This is the first time we have flown Malaysian and sadly will be the last. I was led to believe they were a good quality airline however the only positive I can say is the comfort of the seat with the fact they have a 34"" pitch. Everything else was either satisfactory or poor. The food compared to other airlines was awful and the service wasn't much better. There didn't appear to be enough cabin crew to do what they needed so when I dared to ask for another blanket because I'd spilt water on mine the stewardess was extremely rude to me stating she was too busy and I'd have to wait. When she did bring over she threw it at me and walked off! I don't expect to be treated like that when I had been nothing other than polite. It wasn't as if we had used the call button for anything else."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,5,yes,8,KL to Chennai. Paris Malaysia air staff had effectively through booked us from KL to Chennai. Very smooth transit and luggage transferred for us. KL to Chennai and return economy class. Very efficient service. Food average. Just OK. IFE didn't work on return trip. Happy enough with flight at the price.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,4,yes,7,Flew Malaysian back from Bali to KL and then KL to London. Both flights good. Ground crew friendly. Food very good and air crew excellent apart from one rather surly chap who obviously thought my asking for my mid flight snack was a huge inconvenience for him! Both flights choc full despite all of the recent events. Seats terribly uncomfortable on the A380 and IFE too limited for an airline of this standard.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,2,I flew them in June. Unfortunately my travel experience was really bad. I say this mostly as the staff were unfriendly unapproachable and disdainful. The food/entertainment/seat etc were all pretty standard although I thought it might be better than average. The rudeness of the flight attendants was sadly on each of the 4 flights I took - Melbourne-KL-Manila and return. I asked for water and eyes were rolled I told them about the headphones not working and the lady argued with me. All staff appeared tired flustered and not happy to be there.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,2,no,3,Flew economy from Auckland to KL and then onto London on 20 June returned on 9/10 July. The 777-200s on the AKL to KL leg are in poor condition. Seat covers were worn carpets dirty and stained tray was cracked and the LCD monitors had a poor picture quality. Cabin staff were quite terse with passengers and a few did not have a good command of English. I asked for a dark rum and coke. The stewardess started pouring a bacardi and lemonade. Advised her twice it was the wrong drink but she ignored me. Passenger next to me asked for a can of lager and had to repeat himself three times before I pointed to a can of beer. Food was barely edible with undercooked chicken and stale rolls. KL to LHR leg on the new A380's was better. Planes are new and staff made an effort to be friendly. food was OK but only 3 drinks offered on a 13 hour flight. passengers were constantly asking cabin crew for water to stop dehydration. Check in staff at AKL was rather chaotic and some leadership is required to deal with passengers with excess luggage who were constantly holding up the queue. Disappointed that passengers relatives were wandering in and out of supposedly off limits check in area. Check in staff at London were terse and did not greet me with a hello or thank you. Only positives were cheap fares and planes all left on time. Sad to see a once top airline declining so badly.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,We flew ADL-KUL-IST then CDG-KUL-ADL and we found MH to be very good. All flights were on time and the staff were very attentive coming around with drinks virtually every hour. The food served was quite good although the infamous MH chicken or mushroom roll was served on 2 legs and was just average. The aircraft's were all clean and modern so really no complaints at all.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,,,2,yes,6,Flew CGK-KUL vv. Quite disappointed with MH meals nowadays. In CGK-KUL crew offered fish or chicken and I chose fish which taste so-so and it came with mori biscuit. No chocolate or a cup of water like they used to give. In KUL-CGK it was even worse only a cold tuna sandwich which tasted horrible and orange pudding. But IFE was good crew were attentive and cheerful and got sky interior on both sectors but I expected more for the meal.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,PER-KUL-AMS. Another great flight on Malaysian. Service great food good so glad they now give you mattresses for a better sleep. Only complaint - the IFE needs to be improved but who really remembers what they have watched.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3,no,2,KUL-DPS 737. DPS-KUL 777. Very odd seat layout on the 777 2x5x2 which I've never seen before. Sandwiches looked revolting both ways didn't even unwrap them. Rudest stewardesses I've ever seen surly abrupt and when the people opposite me requested blankets they were practically thrown at them. I can only assume their long haul product is in a different league.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,3,no,4,"KUL to SYD on 777 Economy. I used to travel with MAS regularly and it was on a par with Singapore Airlines. Not anymore. The cost-cutting is palpable. No pre-dinner drinks. Only one cabin crew on each trolley. meaning it took forever to serve meals. Alternative meal ran out well before back of the plane (no choice for me). A simple chicken pastry for breakfast rather than a full hot meal. And the movie selection was dated with mainly B-grade or older films. I hope this once-great airline can trade back to profitability and restore its cabin service to something of which it can be proud. At least they still maintain a decent 34"" seat pitch."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,Flew twice on the Auckland-Kuala Lumpur leg and vice versa a few weeks later on their Boeing 777. The trips were on-time and their cabin crew was very efficient. Food was excellent however the in-flight entertainment could use and upgrade to a newer model. Seat was fine 2-5-2 layout worked well. All in all I enjoyed the trip and I would use them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,3,yes,7,A good flight from LHR to KL on the upper deck of an A380. Bit of a mix-up over a bottle of champagne my sister had bought from the airline for us as when it arrived it was in a sealed bag with some other passengers' names on it. Catering very good lots of drinks runs. In flight entertainment far too limited in choice for an airline with such a good reputation. Crew excellent. Seats no more comfortable than any other aircraft or airline despite my being led to believe the A380 is better.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew Paris to KL on A380 business class July 6 2014. Wonderful flight. Check in smooth. Flight ultra smooth and quiet. First time I have ever had a good nights sleep on any plane. Enjoyed dinner and breakfast. Tasty fresh plentiful and interesting. Wine of very good quality and generous with top ups and further requests during the flight. Staff knew us by name friendly prompt and helpful. Entertainment system brilliant once you got the hang of operating it. Again staff were very helpful with this. Only gripe (and this was very minor I could have done with a wider choice of films to my taste but I suspect that most travellers would have been happy with the choice. The toilets were spotless and bigger than many in the apartment we had in Paris definitely the most spacious I have seen on a plane.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,2,no,3,SIN-KUL (737-800) and KUL-AKL (777-200). As a One World Sapphire card holder I was entitled to use the MH Lounges in SIN and KUL. Both were dated and featured a limited selection of refreshments. Similarly both aircraft cabins were tired and filthy - scuffed walls carpets littered with crumbs torn seat covers etc. IFE was ancient and featured only a limited selection of older movies. Two hot meals were served and to be fair they were decent for Economy. However the crew did not offer refreshments in between meals not even water. Indeed both sets of crew I encountered were distant sullen & at times downright rude. Prospective customers should be aware that MH is far from a 5 star airline these days. In fact I would rank it towards the lower end of 3 star carriers. Would only consider MH again if the airfare was exceptionally cheap.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,HEL-FRA-KUL-SIN on 27th July on E90 (code-share with Flybe Nordic) B777 and B738. All flights were perfectly on time and the cabin crew was absolutely outstanding on the FRA-KUL leg that was half-empty. The B777 was not the newest on the market but the generous 34-inch seat pitch as well as the outstanding service given by a very experienced MH cabin crew made the trip enjoyable. It was great to have a relaxed pre-lunch cocktail service just like in the old days a tasty hot lunch mid-flight sky snack as well as a full hot breakfast before landing at KUL with regular water rounds in the cabin during the night. MH still manages to give a five-star economy experience and we think it wasn't merely good luck. Keep up the great work!
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,KUL to DPS and vice versa were operated by a B772. Although the C class felt outdated the seats and the entire cabin was impeccable. Crew were friendly and extremely polite. Lounge at KUL is spacious and peaceful. More can be done to improve the premium classes and it's offerings. Professional crew and hats off to the entire crew on this flight for continuously smiling. The quality of the catering on MH has gone down and a lot is left to be desired.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,Flew to Vietnam via KL for the first time with two kids aged 7 and 9. Ancient plane so squashed even the blankets in plastic and the cushions provided felt dirty and cheap. Crew gave nothing to the kids. Entertainment system barely works if you can work out how to get it out of its case. Food is terrible. Nothing kids would eat no snack options like biscuits or cheese and crackers. Nothing I would eat! Why would you offer a curry at 7 in the morning on a flight to Melbourne full of Westerners. No alternative options were provided. We flew at night so everyone could sleep but they kept waking us turning lights on serving food pushing seats up when it's the middle of the night. Flight attendants nothing like on the ads that's for sure! Would never fly them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,MH 3123 MIRI - BKI via Labuan. Boarding was easy. Seat comfortable. There was ample reading material. Snack was the packaged peanuts and juice. Staff were very efficient Amazing they could do so much on so short a flight after a short stop in Labuan a meal was served before landing on time in Kota Kinabalu Airport.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,MH1143 June 8 2014 PEN-KLIA. Boarding was easy. The seat was comfortable. Snack was peanuts. Juice was offered. The staff were excellent.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,,,4,yes,6,MH 121 BKI-PER June 11 2014. Boarding was easy. Seat comfortable. The food was awful. Those peanuts again. My worst ever on MH. I wasn't expecting that. Must have been the chefs day off. The cabin staff were excellent. Entertainment was ample.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,MH 2594 KLIA - MIRI . The flight left late owing to late arrival of previous flight. Boarding was easy. Seat comfortable. Food included peanuts and a delicious roti and curry. Choice of drinks. Staff very good. Entertainment was great.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu. The positive point is only punctual operation. I was disappointed with the business class product. I don't understand the concept of using old 738 with no IFE. What do you expect passengers will do with no IFE on a 2.5 hr flight. The seat was fairly uncomfortable. The biggest let down was the food the food served in business class was awful. Stewardess courteous but not attentive nor particular warm and friendly.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,"Took a return flight from Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur a few weeks ago. Had a really great inflight experience. The flight attendants were extremely friendly and helpful. However the inflight entertainment might require some improvements. Some of the movies that being classified as ""latest"" movies were apparently not. But still great movies. All in all still looking forward to have MAS for my future trip."
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,3,yes,9,Flew from London to KL (A380) on 23rd May. Crew were excellent and friendly as usual. Good food and inflight movies. Overall a great experience. The flight cost was rather steep paid circa £900 for economy. You could fly cheaper via SIA or via Emirates - although MH was direct. I frequently use Malaysian airlines but have never been upgraded and I wonder if they should start doing so especially when the flights are not full.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Kuala Lumpur to Brisbane. New Airbus A330-300. Check in was fast and flawless. Very good information about the flight status before boarding. Boarding was greeted well. Flight attendants looks slightly old but alert. Legroom was good. The multimedia interface was excellent with wide variety of shows and movies. Food was good and filling. Very quiet flight even with many people. I would recommend this airlines for an enjoyable flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,6,MEL-KUL on A330. The seat was hard and not very comfy to sit for a longer period. Poor selection on IFE service was decent and food was ok. Nothing really stands out just your average decent airlines. Something for sure that it is not up to the standard of a 5-star airline like others. the service food and IFE on MH is noticeably inferior compared to other legacy airlines i.e. Singapore and Cathay.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,yes,6,KL- Hong Kong June 1 2014. Decent flight food fine service great inflight entertainment a big let down (movies and inflight mag).
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew SYD-KUL-DEL-KUL-MEL. Like most of the reviews I found that the cabin crew had no customer service and all seemed to hate their jobs. That being said I found everything else great. The aircraft ( We had the A330 B737 and the B777 ) were great and all had personal entertainment screens. The entertainment on the international flights was excellent and on the Kuala Lumpur - Delhi flights there wasn't as big of a selection but still good. I found the food great and alcohol was complimentary on all flights. I would definitely fly MH again.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,KL-Colombo MH 184 May 15. Colombo-KL MH 185 May 20. Business Class. Service was still top notch friendly and warm. However I can't really say the same for the food served. Not up to my expectations. The satay somehow tasted bland the sauce wasn't as good as before. Cutting costs?
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,Flew from KUL to LGK on last week first flight experience from KUL to LGK with MAS. The cabin was clean. The crew service was excellent always responded to guests' requests. I have no comment on the foods and beverages on the flight as my flight was less than an hour and only entitled to refreshments. But as for my previous experience with MAS the foods and beverages were moderately good. Boeing 737-800 with more leg room and reduced flight fatigues.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,"Flew Delhi - Kuala Lumpur - Narita on return flights and on all 4 flights the crew service did not disappoint me. They were always up to see what passengers needed encouraging refill of drinks whenever they were awake. On most flights they addressed me by name as Mr. xxxxx without even reading from the list! A small thing like remembering passenger names could really make a positive impression about them. Though there seems many negative comments about seating comfort of B777 it had huge seat pitch (more than 70 inches) and could recline almost flat. Not full flat but there was a slightly angled foot mattress placed behind the seat where it could be adjusted toward leg-rest so that passengers won't slide due to angled flat seat. However I had a problem with seats on newer A330s. They have narrower seat pitch and their angled flat seats are uncomfortable to be honest. It is best if made in ""2nd position"" as indicated in seat adjustment buttons where it gives deep reclined position but not angled flat. Also seat adjustment panels are located in 2 locations one towards aisle or window and can be easily found and the other one hidden inside armrest! The one inside arm rest could choose the positions and can be adjusted manually where as the other can only be adjusted to 3 positions. Ordered Chef-on- Call and was fine. Satay was great. At KL Golden Lounge one should try out local noodles from the noodle bar. They are good! I would score 10 for overall experience due to professional and welcoming service by cabin crew."
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,HKG-DPS found promo tickets business class seats are same price as Cathay Pacific economy. Travelled with them for the first time. Boeing 737-800 from HKG to KL is cramped for Biz class (similar to other airline's Premium Economy) service and food was good. The Malaysian Satay on the plane is great. Boeing 777-200 from KL to DPS was okay for a 3 hours flight much more roomy than the 737. Lounge in KL is sub-par to other 5-Star airlines. Generally a good flight but don't feel they are a 5-star airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,3,no,3,Flew 19/5 and returned 22/5 Denpasar to KL. Flight out on a 777-200 the flight being on time was the highlight. Have to say the meal service was the worst I have experienced. Staff appeared confused and missed a few rows out completely. The meal was down sized to a hot meal only. Return on a 737-800 again on time and easier to use entertainment. The first drink serviced arrived and we were offered either a chicken or egg sandwich. This was the meal service for this full service airline. On asking if I could have a beer with that I was informed that this was a non alcohol flight.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,2,no,2,Have to agree with Geoffrey Carver about the Boeing 777 that MAS still use. These belong in the scrapyard with the seats not even meeting premium economy standards. How do Skytrax manage to maintain the 5-Star rating for the airline? Besides the cabin products looking old tired and often shabby the once fantastic cabin crew are now more often miserable and certainly not focussed on customer service.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,1,KL to Beijing return A330 each way. Outbound flight only half full and being the redeye there were plenty of empty rows in the center so wife and kids slept nearly the whole way. I ended up wandering up to business only about a third full to chat with a friend I happily realised was aboard also and stayed about 4 hours and the crew were fine with that. Tasty meal kids pack and more than enough booze thank you. Inbound flight was 6am so very full yet tasty breakfast and OK coffee kids happy with the entertainment.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,KL to AKL and return. B777. Business class. I hate the 777 with a vengeance. It is uncomfortable incredibly noisy and frankly outdated. Storage is poor.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,A380 LHR to KL and return. Business class. Our first trip in the 380 and very impressive too. Spacious comfortable. Good standard of catering. Cabin crew pleasant and obliging. Better than 747 by some distance. No hesitation in recommending.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,My husband and myself flew DUB-LHR-KUL-AKL return in April / May. We had a lovely trip both ways with all flights on time. We were really impressed with the flight attendants as they did all they could to make our trip pleasant. We cannot understand some of the negative reviews as our experience of MAS was totally positive.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,7,Penang to Kuala Lumpur only a one hour flight and meal was very limited. The service was good though and the flight was quite punctual.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,Kuala Kumpur to Osaka. A very pleasant flight. Courteous service and very good IFE. The late night snack was a bit paltry (small tuna roll) but the wine they served was very good. The breakfast was very enjoyable.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,7,SYD-KUL-LHR Business class. First leg on nearly new A330 was excellent. I like the angled lie flat seat I seem to be able to sleep well. Food (call the chef service) was excellent and the drinks kept flowing. KUL to LHR on the A380 lovely aircraft and plenty of crew but the seat is awful. I find it very difficult to find a comfortable sitting position. Food OK on this service nothing remarkable. The First Class lounge at KL is nothing special - despite the renovation. I had a long layover and was hoping to use a sleeping room but they were all occupied at 4am (some occupied by staff!) so ended up checking into the excellent airside hotel for a three hour sleep.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,KL- Dubai - KL on A330 business class. The seat cabin ambience and food served was of good standard. Entertainment choices pretty limited for medium haul flight but don't bother me much since I am not a movie person. Crews were attentive and friendly on both sectors. Overall it was good.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,yes,5,Used Malaysia Airlines to fly from London to Australia. The flights were on time and the leg to Kuala Lumpur in the A380 was very comfortable. The food was very average and the service too. This Airline is stated in this website as a 5 star airline but I don't think is up to that standard. The service compared with other airlines I flew before was nothing special.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,2,no,1,Dehli-KL 5th May. It has been a couple of years since we flew with Malaysia and in the last 6 weeks have flown with them 4 times. On this flight I had to endure takeoff with the seat in front fully reclined. Second time this has happened and a word to crew members is met with a shrug. Food on all flights inedible. Like the other flights no alcohol on offer was coke orange juice or water. I asked for water and got juice. Attitude of FAs unacceptable. Although I live in Malaysia I will avoid this airline wherever possible.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,5,no,2,Flew from Melbourne - Jakarta. The ticket was cheap but service was poor no smile when serving food. We had our baby with us and wanted their help to heat up some milk but it took ages for the cabin crew to come when we pressed the call button.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,2,"My family and I flew 3 sectors MAN-LHR (BA) and LHR-KUL-DPS on 13th April on the A380. Booked through MAS. Firstly nearly missed the flight as the domestic flight from MAN-LHR had been brought forward by 2.5 hours MAS had failed to notify us by email post or phone. It was only because I insist on being early that we made the flight! On board MH3 first impressions of the A380 was of dirt and ingrained filth and unfriendly crew. The seatbacks were really grimy and gave the relatively new aircraft the impression of having never been cleaned. No menus or amenity kits. The toilets were average but not cleaned to a good standard. The meals were revolting. No salt and pepper. Coffee offered before meal started. The children's meals were just lasagne. No choice at all. No kids packs offered. Drinks were poured into thimble sized glasses and the white wine was warm and vinegary. Crew flung the meals out in a disinterested fashion. No drinks brought round in the flight at all. We had to keep asking the irritable crew who were sitting in the galley reading magazines with curtains pulled round for glasses of water. Seatbelt signs on permanently and pointlessly since it was smooth as could be in the cruise. We kept hearing ""Ladies and Gentlemen as we are experiencing turbulence hot drink service will be suspended"" What hot drink service was that then? I must have blinked. We flew MAS in 2005 they have plummeted in standards since then. This time I chose them because they were excellent before and paid £710 per person this time around. What a big disappointment."
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,2,no,3,6 May 2014 MH 388 to Shanghai Pudong. What is going in with Malaysian airlines? Service seems to have taken a dive together with food quality. Revamped First class lounge in KL is worse than the noodle cafe outside. Removing the platinum lounge to make way for that not so good. Also what's with the entertainment onboard? Please change it around faster. Having the same TV and movies running for months is not cool. Been flying MAS for 10 years and platinum member for 3. So I have seen the decline.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,We flew Malaysia Airlines from Kuala-Lumpur to Melbourne a few days ago and we were pleasantly surprised with the service they provided. The cabin crew were excellent. Constantly checking if you were OK. They all seemed very happy and cheerful. Inflight entertainment food etc are all basically the same in any airline but the crew can make the difference.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,yes,7,Bangkok - Tawau v.v. via Kuala Lumpur. Their hard product for this route is not up to industrial standard very old 737-800 in all flight worn out interior black stains all over torn seat cushion not fully functioned toilet and no entertainment at all. However they are not bad in other product offering. The food although far from decent in portion are tasty. Seat pitch is reasonably good perfectly punctual. Every of their staff are terrific service with smile and tried to solve the problem caused by their ageing aircraft. They really show us what Malaysian Hospitality mean.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,yes,5,Frankfurt - Kota Kinabalu via Kuala Lumpur and back (B777-200 for long haul flight B737-800 for domestic flight). What I appreciated most - apart from the on-time arrivals - was the rather generous legroom on the B777 (rarely found elsewhere nowadays). However otherwise I found Malaysia Airlines quite average. 3 of the 4 planes did not look as if they were just delivered from the factory the cabins had a slightly worn look. Likewise the cushion had probably not been in contact with detergent for several weeks. The (vegetarian) food was only mediocre beverages were not served between the meals (on a 11-12 hour flight). Water and soft drinks were available in the galley but if one has a window or center seat that is of limited use.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,April 2014. I was pleasantly surprised. Our flight PER - KL was good. It was delayed an hour in Perth and then we raced for our connecting flight to Paris only to find that flight had been delayed as well but the food was really nice and the service was with a smile. KL-Paris on the A380 top deck was a great experience. The Entertainment had a great variety and snacks were available all through the flight. Paris to KL we were seated on the top deck again and I don't think I would like to fly below after experiencing this as there are not many seats the food comes out quickly and best of all is cleared away quickly. Kids were happy as they could plug their laptops in very easily and I found the headphones comfortable. Hubby sat next to the window and I was quite jealous of the little locker he had there and the shelf to lean on. I cant complain about anything. KL-Perth - back on the A330 and we noticed the difference with space might not be much smaller but it certainly felt more cramped. First thing I noticed was how dirty it was looked like a previous passenger had spilt something down the seat opposite me on the aisle and it hadn't been cleaned the carpet was also very worn down the aisle and there were a few unsmiling hostesses and our buzzer didn't get answered however it was a smooth flight with a great landing into Perth which is known for its turbulence on landing. All in all we enjoyed every flight service was great especially on 3 of the flights and not a sausage roll in sight. I would fly them again if I could sit up top and the price was right but Singapore Airlines is still my preferred airline - they do beat Malaysia in all areas. On another note my daughter left her ipad in the pocket of her seat when we landed in Perth and it was handed in and we picked it up the next day - so relieved.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew KUL-LHR and return. Clean sleek and simple. Flight was on time and I felt comfortable. For this trip I had also flown BA to Prague and it was such a disappointment. Only thing I would suggest to MAS is to upgrade its inflight meals.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,MH - 128 Melbourne to KL - New A330 Aircraft was very clean and new Inflight entertainment was very good staff were not very attentive at all. Chicken sausage roll I found to be excellent however everyone else in the travel group hated it! Breakfast dishes were both terrible. MH 791 - Phuket to KL - New 737-800 Flight was excellent Chicken Lasagne was one of the best I have eaten cabin crew were good. Best flight of the trip! MH - 149 KL to Melbourne - Old 777-200 (1997 to be exact) however the comfiest plane I have been on! Headrest had an excellent range of movement to create a nice pillow the IFE screen was old and hard to see but not needed as I slept the whole way.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,6,6 flights in total London-KL (A380 upper deck) return KL-Kuching return and KL-Langkawi return. The London-KL flight wasn't too bad cabin crew were efficient but the food didn't taste too great but edible. Inflight entertainment was quite good. The internal flights were only about an hour and actually the food served was better than the long haul flights. The flight from KL-London was delayed by 3 hours - I wouldn't have minded so much but the flight departed around 3am and all the passengers were tired and cranky including us. At KL the ground staff at the transfer desk were not at all sympathetic. They said that the delay was due to waiting for passengers from a flight from Perth and as there were so many people connecting to this flight they had to wait for them. They gave us some meal vouchers and I asked them if I could use them anywhere our departure sector they told me yes except for Harrods and another restaurant. We went to a 24hr cafe and they declined my voucher! On both the long haul flights there were babies crying throughout the flight which did not make the trip too pleasant. Overall i would fly Malaysia Airlines again as the price was not too bad for the product they provide however if I had the choice I would probably pay a bit extra to fly with Singapore Airlines as the level of service was a lot better.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,We recently flew from KL to Brisbane on MH134. We have flown Malaysian several times both in economy and in business. Overall quite happy with the experience. The food is good although the gluten free options available to my partner are very limited and need improvement. The chef on call service available to business and first class passengers finally seems to be up and running. The service from cabin staff is excellent and very attentive. One negative is the delayed departures from Kl. This was the second flight we have taken from Kl where the flight was significantly delayed.. Malaysian airlines need to improve on this. Also the inflight entertainment choices are only average. We will probably fly Malaysian again although it will depend on price comparison with other airlines.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,no,2,Mumbai to Perth with a stopover at KUL. By far the worst experience I've had. The flight in Mumbai was delayed by over 2 hours due to late arrival of incoming flight. Finally staff started boarding and let passengers into the gates. However everyone was stopped from boarding and were kept waiting at the aerobridge for more than 1.5 hours! There was little explanation with some staff talking amongst themselves about a technical problem. No one was allowed back into the terminal to use the toilets. Had to run at KL with hardly 10 mins to catch the connecting flight. Their seats are by far the most uncomfortable business class seats I've seen. The angular seats leave you with a terrible back ache. Never again.
,,,First Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,2,no,5,London Heathrow - Kuala Lumpur 12 April on MH 003. The Malaysian airlines first class is not as impressive in comparison to other first class A380's out there on the market. It lacked style and good cabin ambience. It felt like MAS simply had to put a first class in for the sake of it and didn't really think through the idea. I've thought that MAS was the leading carrier in south east asia and hope that it will redesign its first class cabin. It such a shame with an amazing aircraft like the A380 that the first class product is simply mediocre.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew from Perth to Paris on Friday 11th April. A fantastic experience. Could not complain on a single element. The food in economy was plentiful and extremely tasty and well presented with a lovely drink service too. Snacks and refreshments offered during the 13 hour flight KL to Paris. In flight entertainment was adequate not the best I've had but certainly enough choice. Flew KL to Paris on a new A380. Plenty of leg room (I'm 6ft 2) but I did have the bonus of the small upstairs economy cabin. All up highly recommend and a bargain for the price you pay!
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,I have travelled frequently with MAS between London and KL for the past 4 years. Throughout this time I have also travelled the same route with Singapore Airlines but had generally chosen MAS as they fly direct. The general standard over the past 4 years on this flight has been consistently anything but pleasant. The standard of food is what you would generally expect in an economy cabin albeit served differently. The cabin staff are unwilling to serve anything alcoholic prior to departure I have tested this on every occasion I have flown. The seats fail to recline fully every time I point this out to the cabin staff ends with the same unsuccessful trial and error approach to rectification despite knowing that this is how they have been designed. On my last sojourn I wished to sit next to a colleague. The flight was fully booked but despite this the check in staff provided me with a boarding pass that was next to my colleague. Shortly after boarding another passenger approach with a boarding pass which had also been issued for the same seat. The flights are consistently delayed. My last 3 flights have been delayed by 3 10 and 2 hours consecutively. As MAS are the only carrier to fly direct from London to KL the cost of the flight is considerably more expensive more than flying with other airlines that are not able to fly direct. My last journey was the one that finally broke me in the future I will choose to fly via an indirect route as I can't tolerate the consistent level of service provided by MAS any longer.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,LHR-KUL return on A380. Checked in was fast and hassle free especially in Kuala Lumpur. Was very surprised at the service in Economy Class. I travelled long hauls about 10x a year with various airlines (mostly Etihad). Crew were very efficient serving meals within 40 minutes of take off in a full cabin! However surprised by lack of choice. Plastic cutlery which is not very premium like. Plenty of drinks and crew answers call very fast indeed. Despite a busy flight the lavatories were cleaned frequently. The most by any airlines I've flown with so far. The crew were hard working and professional smiling and they interacted well with passengers. Its the small details that makes this crew the best I've flown with. Some might not like it but at least doesn't feel robotic. TV screens were big and selection of movies were good enough. Headsets were ok. Definitely the highlight is the crew not even the A380 size could beat it. If only the prices were more affordable and the Frequent Flyer programme were better I'd be using this at least 3x a year!
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew A330-300 Brisbane to KL and then A380 KL to London return. Second trip in less than 12 months flying Malaysia and once again could not fault the cabin crew and level of service. Seats on A330 angled/flat but managed to get some sleep and A380 seat pretty much flat and ok comfort wise. Only real complaint is that less than 12 months could not believe how the standard of meals had dropped. Ordered via chef on call and worked out ok but most meals I just picked at as were terrible. Very disappointed as were restaurant standard on last flight 11 months ago.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,"LHR-KUL-BKK and return. MAS A380 is an excellent product whilst the seats are not individual 2-2-2 formation they are comfortable and great when travelling with a colleague/partner. Flight attendants very friendly service excellent chef-on-call meals worked fine and wasn't too bad for plane food. Seats comfortable for sitting/relaxing and sleeping. would recommend rows 78 or 9 on the upper deck for a more private cabin. KUL-BKK on a very new 737-800. Again all excellent. All flights bang on time in both departure and arrival. Before we booked the flight we done a lot of research and at GPB 1739 return this really is a great product for the price and really knocks the socks other airlines with there individual business class ""cabins"". MAS is circa £1000 cheaper and I can safely say i would have no hesitation in booking with them again. Great product for a great price."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,2,no,2,DPS-KUL B777 Economy class. Flight delayed 30 minutes and no information on the delay. Cabin interior looked very tired. Food was really awful and service was slow. Cabin crew looked unhappy and surly. Please avoid the airline unless the fare is extremely low.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,I flew Malaysia Airlines sub MasWings from LBU-SDK via BKI on 31st March 2014. Check in at LBU was longer than normal as the staff member couldn't seem to get my booking for my BKI-SDK flight and I had to give him my booking details. MH3938 from LBU-BKI left on time and landed early. MH3104 from BKI-SDK left and landed on time. My baggage was out under 10 mins. The only let down was we were given a pack of peanut and no IE. Drinks came with some options. Overall good job from me.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,MH711 March 8 2014. Flew from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta recently. Flight was okay overall but it was not without its unpleasant moments. One of the lavatories at the back of the plane was out. As a result quite a large line formed after the food service. While I normally do not use the front lavatories as I know those are for Business or First class I assumed given the circumstances it was justified. What followed was a very ugly scene with the flight attendant who accused me of lying about the lavatory being out of order. We argued for quite some time as well as while she called to confirm. Only then would she let me use the restroom. I didn't appreciate being treated like a small child. I think it is highly unlikely that the lavatory broke mid-flight which means Malaysia Airlines undertook the flight knowing it was a toilet short of what it needed on a full flight.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,My wife and I travelled from Heathrow to Auckland and back with MA in business class. Firstly the food was excellent (my wife had a steak which she confirmed was better than any she had eaten in a New Zealand restaurant). Food and snacks just kept on coming! With the exception of the KL - Auck leg (777-200) the planes were in good condition and most comfortable. Unfortunately the 777-200 doesn't have fully flat beds and for us it was uncomfortable as one seemed to slip to the bottom of the seat as soon as one fell asleep (as mentioned by many others here). The A380 is great! We liked the lounge at KL and at Auckland although the Heathrow lounge is not quite as good. Massages were available in the lounge at KL but we felt they were a tad too expensive so didn't avail ourselves of the opportunity. I would definitely use MA again.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,3,AMS-KUL-SIN and KUL-AMS. Really disappointed would sum up my feelings. It was my first experience of MH we usually fly SQ for our trips to the Far East. Dirty old looking plane that looked like it hadn't had a deep clean in years. Very old entertainment system which seemed to go faulty throughout the flight to the annoyance of passengers and indifference of crew. Outbound the crew seemed completely disinterested disappearing for hours after serving lunch much more friendly and professional crew on return trip but same stale hard product filthy toilets dirty worn out seats (arm rest came apart and seat would not remain upright). Food and beverages decidedly average with no choice on two of the four meals we had. Would only fly again as a very last resort.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,3,no,2,MH003 and 135 on 10th Feb. Returned 13th March on MH134 and MH004. Flight from Heathrow to Brisbane. Poor quality food. Staff reluctant to offer extra beverages especially on the outward leg from Heathrow to KL.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Having completed 4 long haul flights I found MH to offer good value for money all flights operated on time the food and wine was of an acceptable standard the entertainment has greatly improved especially on the A380 they need to upgrade the B777 to the A380 level. Cabin crew were excellent. We travelled MH003/11 Feb LHR-KUL MH141/12 Feb KUL-SYD and MH130/16 Mar AKL-KUL MH004/18 Mar KUL-LHR. We took advantage of an upgrade offer on the AKL-KUL flight for a small fee We noted that the food service was poor for business class eg only 1 dessert choice and no cheese selection.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,My last flight with MH was October 2013 from Melbourne to Istanbul and back. Cabin crew were brilliant all done with a smile and the food was good. Would definitely travel with Malaysian again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,5,yes,8,I flew with MAS sub MASWINGS from Sandakan to Labuan via Kota Kinabalu on 24 March 2014. My 1st flight MH 3094 was delayed and they put me on the next available flight MH 3037. I was able to catch my connecting flight on time. Both flights were on ATR 72.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I travelled from LHR-PER stopped over in KL on my return. Travelled on A380 the seats food service and comfort were incredible. The inflight entertainment had a good variety of films. Cabin crew were courteous and friendly. I only have praise for Malaysia Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,PER-KUL-AMS in January. The cabin crew were rude no smiles and not friendly at all. It was as though us passengers were a major inconvenience for them. Like so many negative reviews about Malaysian Airlines the seatbelt sign stayed on almost the entire flight despite smooth flying. Passengers were ignoring the seatbelt sign and would leave their seats and the cabin crew ignored it. We booked 2 seats together yet when we checked in we were separated for some unknown reason. The meal was awful. That was my last flight with Malaysian Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,2,no,2,My wife and I travelled on flight MH 120 to Kota Kinabalu ex Perth Western Australia 13th March 2014 and returned on March 23 2014 on MH 121. Both these flights did not serve tea or coffee with the excuse that there was a safety reason. The crew was nowhere to be seen when departing the aircraft in Perth (except for the captain who said goodbye). We have travelled all over Asia with a number of airlines and we have never had this type of service.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew SYD-KUL-SYD on the new A330. Way out cabin crew were fairly disinterested and it was difficult to get their attention but on the way back some of the best service I have had I didn't need to ask for anything. Seats were quite spacious and fairly comfortable. Good choice of films on IFE. As others have said the chicken pastry is awful. Would overall recommend.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,DPS-KUL return. Outbound on a 737 - even though it's only a 3.5 hour flight it's unusual for major airlines not to have individual IFE (even Qantas has it on DRW-SYD!). Return on a 777 that was much more pleasant - in fact just having 9-across on a 777 is a reason to choose Malaysian (or Singapore) over someone like Emirates and their cattle trucks. Otherwise it's the Malaysian I remember from a few years ago - reasonable service facilities and organisation. Food has really gone downhill - one of the meals tasted good while the other seemed uncooked but both were very small and simple.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,2,no,4,SYD-KUL-HYD and return in economy. Compared to the competition the level of service was not up to the mark. General attitude of staff was not friendly. Though both the aircraft's were pretty new the quality of service only meant that the overall value was still lacklustre. Food was OK and the choices were very limited. Staff tended to be between neutral to rude. I stood up to stretch my legs on the flight when the seatbelt sign was off and was told by a crew member in a 'commanding tone' to go back to my seat and sit down. It took at least 5 presses on the flight attendant button and 15 mins of waiting for them to serve a glass of water.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,We flew to KL from Adelaide on an A330 - nice and clean. Seats not very comfortable though - inseat entertainment very good. Service was fantastic - never had to ask for anything. Meals were a bit pathetic for a nearly 8 hour flight. Please get rid of those awful cardboard like chicken/veg rolls they are disgusting and not the sort of thing I really felt like for breakfast. Overall a good experience better that Qantas but nowhere near the standard of Air New Zealand.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,KUL-SBW-KUL B737-800. I flew last few month with MAS the service was excellent. The cabin crew were nice and the domestic flight had inflight entertainment. The inflight meal where I had a special request was ok but still a lot of room to improve. I will fly with MAS again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew economy class on an A330-300 from Kuala Lumpur to Perth. The aeroplane was very clean staff were very good and friendly the seats in economy class was quite comfortable but they should give more space. The toilet was very small. The meals provided was in few choices and good. The inflight entertainment was good too there was a lot of movies music shows and dramas. Overall it was good.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,no,3,Flight between SYD-KUL-SYD were on new A330-300s. Excellent service food was great on both sectors. My only negative comments are about seats. They were the worst seats I have sat in as for sleeping just forget it. The A330 business class seat is a disgrace on MH I found it extremely uncomfortable never again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew with family to New Zealand from Heathrow into Kuala Lumpur and then onto Auckland. Return journey was Auckland to Kuala Lumpur and then to Schipol. Flights were on time allowing ample time for making connecting flights. Staff were very friendly and helpful and worked tirelessly on these long haul flights As with a lot of airlines economy class seating is not the most comfortable but you get what you pay for. The food was very good and the vegetarian option which I had was varied throughout the journeys. Couldn't fault the inflight entertainment which provided excellent selections of current movies and old favourite TV programmes. All in all a very pleasant experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,3,yes,9,Flew to KL from London on 19th Feb 14 on A380. Collapsed when stood up too quickly hitting my head hard on the ground (I've flow hundreds of times and this was a first so beware sitting for many hours then standing up too fast). Crew were outstanding finding a row of seats for me to lie down on. providing an ice pack for the bruising and regular checks to make sure I was ok. Even moved us to the front of the plane for a fast exit. Well done MAS - faultless service.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,2,no,7,Flew business class on an A330 from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur. I just have to say the aeroplane was very clean staff were very good my only negative comments are about seats. They were the worst seats I have sat in as for sleeping forget it. The toilet was very small and by the way this flight was not cheap. I would never fly with this airline in business class again. Economy short flights yes.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,KUL-DXB-KUL. Airport check in staff were good check in was quick. Flight en route to DXB was 30 mins delayed but arrived on time. Flight back to KUL was on time and arrived 30 minutes early. Outbound stewardesses did not smile at all and did not showing much interest in customer and comfort - disorganized team. Otherwise return flight FA's were attentive. Food for lunch was so-so and sandwich was awful. IFE was good and functioned well. All in all sad to say nothing special about MH and it was average.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,1,no,4,I am a frequent flyer. Having flown 6 sectors with Malaysian over Christmas and New Year I have enough experience to make a judgement. The cabin crew are generally inefficient and disinterested. The food is mediocre (breakfast during an 8 hour flight consists of a soggy chicken pasty and no hot drinks). Despite relatively calm flights on all 6 sectors I was offered tea just once due to the seatbelt signs being illuminated for most of the flights on all 6 sectors (which the majority of passengers ignored but the cabin crew ignored their non compliance). No safety demonstration given on 2 flights. They failed to honour a bulk-head seat reservation that they charged me extra for due to a change of aircraft and instead gave it to someone else.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,,,2,no,5,Flight from Kuala Lumpur to Seoul (MH 0066) on 15 Feb 2014 and Seoul to Kuala Lumpur (MH 0067). MH 0066 flight was delayed 3 hours because of a problem with the cargo we were sat on the plane waiting. MH0067 - The cabin crew were not very interested or friendly during service.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,"MH148 MH1. MEL-KUL-LHR 5 Feb. Flight crew and aircraft excellent. Some of the complaints on here are truly childish. Things like ""cabin was filthy"" ""no chicken curry"" ""no window seat"" you arrived safely in comfort that's the important thing folks. Complaints about cabin crew maybe reflects your attitude to them and the way you treat them."
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flight from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur. My first flight with this carrier was very positive. The entertainment system was great for a four hour flight and the food was very delicious. Looking forward to flying with Malaysia again.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,I have flown hundreds of time on various airlines and have never felt the inclination to leave a bad review until now. We flew from Melbourne to Hanoi with Malaysia just a few days ago and it was an experience not to be savoured. The staff were very unhelpful when I asked if there were any rows of seats available after take off I was promptly told that by the flight attendant that she didn't know and that I should walk to the rear of the plane and check for myself this was despite the fact she had just walked the aisle several times prior. Generally the staff were very unfriendly and unhelpful. Then the food arrived it was the worst dinner I have seen on a plane - needless to say we skipped dinner. All in all I would not fly with this airline again as I know what great service can be found on others like Emirates Etihad or Qatar.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,4,no,5,4 flights on MH in Business Class. MH 726 Jakarta to KL: The 2 female flight attendants serving were friendly and managed to address passengers by name. Although upon boarding neither were smiling. and indeed they look most unhappy. The forward toilet was dirty. I was also surprised that my cutlery had not been properly cleaned. The issue of MH's Nasi Lemak has received a lot of media coverage and yet the product on the flight from Jakarta to KL was not complete - it was only rice with prawns in a sauce with an egg. MH 129 KL to Melbourne: Boarding was efficient crew friendly and generally service was good. However the purser did not seem to do anything except look unhappy and did not interact with more than a couple of passengers. Surprised to be told that champagne could not be served while the aircraft was on the ground! The selection of newspapers and magazines needs to be less myopic. Similarly a better selection of world business and general interest magazines would be appreciated. MH 146 Melbourne to KL: Flight was much less enjoyable and probably only saved by the efforts of the female flight attendant in business class who made up for the poor service from the two other males and flight service director. She was the only person who addressed me by name. No menus available. The two male flight attendants went about their jobs with the minimum of interaction with customers service was very off-hand. The chef-on-call dish of beef was very tough. Most times when I went to use the toilets at the rear of the business class cabin they were occupied. As there were only 10 passengers in business class and they were all in their seats it suggests that the flight attendants allowed economy passengers to use the business class toilets. MH 723 KL to Jakarta: Not much to complain about although the flight attendant did not address passengers by name.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,SYD-PEN-SYD (via KUL) in Economy. SYD-KUL-SYD on new A330-300s. Check-in at SYD was fast and the agent was really friendly. Fast-track through immigration and security provided because of elite status. Priority boarding for status passengers honoured. Seated in bulkhead rows on both flights where legroom was plentiful. Onboard catering was reasonable and of a decent portion but nothing outstanding. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful with the exception of one particular female attendant on the SYD-KUL leg who was a bit abrupt with other passengers. IFE was AVOD with a reasonable selection of movies and TV shows. Seat itself was much more comfortable than I was expecting and recline was also quite generous which made it comfortable enough to get a decent amount of sleep on the overnight flight back home. Both flights on time. KUL-PEN-KUL was on very old B737-400s. These planes will thankfully be gone by the end of this year. Priority boarding on the domestic flights for status passengers honoured. Both flights slightly delayed. Peanuts and juice offered on these flights. Cabin crew for these flights were friendly helpful and enthusiastic. Overall I was very satisfied with my experience on all flights and for the price paid it was great value for money.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,3,no,3,KL to Brisbane on MH135 on A330. Check-in was efficient and the flight left on time. During the 8 hour flight we only had one meal. It was announced that there was a choice of fish pasta or chicken curry. My wife and I were both looking forward to the chicken curry. When the trolley arrived the hostess told us that they had run out of chicken curry. When she saw the disappointed look on our faces she told us it was the pasta or we go without. We both chose the pasta which turned out to be bland and awful. The cabin crew just couldn't be bothered serving passengers. We barely saw them during the entire 8 hour flight. The entertainment was average. Also I had never been on a flight where announcements were made so frequently. They were made twice in English and Malay. If you were trying to sleep or use the in-flight entertainment these constant announcements were annoying. I will not fly Malaysian Airlines again unless the price is extremely cheap.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,BKK-KUL-HKG 23rd and 24th Feb first flight on a 737-800. I've used MH a few times before and always enjoyed the flight check in quick they use the Thai lounge in BKK which is just ok. Boarding quick and on time departure the aircraft was clean and fairly new I must say it was very comfortable. Food was ok and cabin crew did a good job - very friendly. KUL-HKG checked in at KL Central I made a mistake with online booking date ticket desk managed to change the mistake quickly for a charge of about £20.00. MH KL lounge is fine with a decent selection of food although I always find it very busy. Flight operated on a 777-200 I had to accept the last seat 4E in the centre middle but it turned out to be fine! I like the seats on this aircraft find them very comfortable. I used the same aircraft the other year for a long haul from LAX to TPE crew on this flight were very friendly food was just ok I managed an hours sleep before landing on time.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,I flew Business class last Dec from KL to Perth (return) 3 Adults and 1 infant. I must say I was very disappointed with the service. Service was slow our food was extremely salty thus inedible. They did not give me the baby food that I had pre ordered. I am now having trouble with my seating arrangements and customer service has been very slow to rectify this problem.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,4,MH 171 KTM-KUL 21 Feb. The cabin crew were not very interested in service and completely disappeared after the meal was served. I could hear the chatter and laughs from the galley and also saw them using tablets in full view of the passengers. Unprofessional.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,SYD-LHR-SYD (via KUL) in Business Class. Flight between SYD and KUL were on new A330-300s and flights between KUL and LHR were on the A380s. All flights on time. Cabin crew on all flights were very friendly courteous and helpful without being robotic. Check-in at SYD very smooth and quick with a very friendly agent. Angled flat-bed seats on the A330-300 is behind industry standard but they were comfortable enough to allow sleep but storage space is severely limited. Flat-bed seats on the A380 are much more comfortable with a lot more storage space for personal items but still not an industry-leading product. Forward mini-cabin on A380 feels very private and quiet. On-board catering reasonably good on all flights with the satay being consistently top-notch. Check-in at LHR also quick with friendly agents. All seat requests honoured as well as Chef-on-call meal orders. A very good product overall let down only by the hard product on the A330-300 but it was excellent value for money. Taking everything into consideration Malaysia Airlines will usually be my first choice to Europe.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,3,no,4,MH002 SGN-KUL-LHR on 737-800 and on A380 for the London leg. Good service from Ho Chi Minh. Nice food and nice plane (I'm used to Ryanair's version of the 737-800). Disappointing service on the long-haul to London. Cabin attendants failed to clean up a full glass of red wine which was spilled all over the exit door in front (I was in 74A which is a window seat without another seat in front. Incidentally this seat isn't worth paying extra for unless you are over 6 foot tall - the tray table and console are poor). Passenger in 73 left wine on the flimsy tray table (he had similar bulk-head style tray-table as me) which then got propelled across cabin due to turbulence. Took several attempts to get steward to clean it up. Will be avoiding Malaysia Airlines in future.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,3,Leaving Frankfurt 19th Feb arriving 20th Feb. MH 5. I have just returned from New York via Frankfurt with 2 different airlines of which one was Malaysia. I really have to say that it now feels like a different airline. In short I feel that the cutting cost is obvious. I feel the spirit of the crew is not there.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,4,We flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur and back from Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur and from there to Amsterdam on 18 Feb 2014. The flight Amsterdam - Kuala Lumpur had decent service and friendly staff. However the return journey from Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur was a disappointment. Staff were bland and ignored your wishes. Even worse was the journey between Kuala Lumpur and Amsterdam. The food was distributed quickly the lights did not work which meant we could not read our book. We had different expectations of this airline.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,yes,8,"KL - Langkawi - KL - Phuket. Three flights on average 1 hour each on my tour of the Far East. The first two flights were on an ageing 737-200 and the last on a newish 737-800. Was surprised that the airline was dry on all but the last flight. Old business class on the 737-200 - which was very tatty. The newish 737-800 was very comfortable. FAs on all flights were friendly and efficient. My wife ate the food on all flights and said it was ""okay"". The lounge at KL was very average and again no booze. MA was for the purpose we booked them - okay. Would only use them again if I had to."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,Flew KL to Melbourne late last Saturday night. Had been offered and received a Boarding Pass for this leg of the trip the previous day in Yangon. At that time I'd been asked if I wanted a window seat to which I'd replied that I did. When I got on the flight I found myself squashed in the middle of the row two people each side. The seat didn't recline and the in-flight entertainment didn't work for most of the journey. This was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever been on and definitely would not recommend Malaysia Airlines to anyone.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Flew KL to Denpasar 9th Feb. Rude check in clerk altered our pre booked seating allocation separating my family of 4 - I had booked these seats 6 months in advance. Cabin crew equally unhelpful. They left the seat belt light on for the entire trip. When I approached the business class cabin crew to use the lavatory urgently I was told to go back to my economy seat and wait. For a supposed full service airline there is no service.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,,1,no,3,MEL-LHR via KL return. Very disappointed with the Biz class seats on the legs to and from Melbourne to KL. The seat only had 3 settings and it had to be the hardest seat I have sat on. The cabin was filthy. The food was very disappointing. Overall this Biz class was certainly not worth the money. They need to review the aircraft they use on MEL to KUL leg - this is substandard. On a positive note the A380 (KL to London) Biz seats were very comfortable and the staff very friendly!
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,2,no,2,Flew KUL-MEL A330. First class lounge in KUL was terrible. Service OK but A La Cart breakfast horrible. Food on board was worse. Inedible 'spicy chicken' limp salad and cream cheese instead of proper cheese. Meal before landing was even worse. Undercooked pastry with unidentifiable mushroom filling. That was it. 3 bites and it was gone. MAS used to be an unbelievable product. Its Air Asia flatbeds or SQ or EK from now on.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Excellent service food was great. New seating and aircraft for the MEL-KUL leg was great the way personal space is utilised is brilliant. The 777 aircraft on the KUL-FRA route was very tired and dated the fleet definitely needs retrofitting and IFE viewing quality on these aircraft is poor. Nonetheless service was great and would happily fly with MAS again.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,6,I flew business class from KUL to NRT. From the (just renovated) lounge to the service quality of the cabin crew I would say that the experience was average. The newly renovated lounge atmosphere was simply chaotic and noisy food variety on offer was very limited. Noodles from the noodle bar barely edible. Shower facilities was nothing to write about. The service delivery was just mediocre. There was no drink rounds after the meal service the cabin crew were busy chatting away in the galley. I was expecting more from the cabin crew. Food quality are at best economy standard. Fortunately the experience was saved by the comfortable seat and generous leg space of Boeing 777. I would not recommend anyone to fly MH unless the price is cheap.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Travelled economy class on MH003 11 Feb LHR-KUL seat 80H and MH141 12 Feb KUL-SYD seat 26C. Both flights the crew were very good the seat and entertainment selection is far superior on the A380. I would recommend this airline as they offer a good product and value for money. The areas they could improve is the quality of the food especially the inflight snack on the LHR-KUL sector.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,7th Jan. Late flight Brisbane to Paris via K/L. A great airline. Excellent service from beautifully groomed flight attendants. The vegetarian food was the best I have ever had on an airline. There was plenty of good service with drinks. Very helpful and gracious staff. Put up in a fabulous hotel in Kuala/L. in between flights.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Brisbane to Kuala Lumpur return on A330-300 flight on time and flight attendants were helpful and friendly plane was clean and looked fairly new. Would not hesitate in recommending Malaysia Airlines for travel.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Travelled A380 KL to HK. Seat 56C economy class. This flight appeared to be only a third full. I noticed some people changed seats to have a length to themselves. The cabin was clean and spacious. The flight crew all impeccable with presentation and attitude. Security was tight at KL which I'm not complaining about at all. Plenty of leg room and very comfortable. I have travelled on various other A380 aircraft from different carriers and I found Malaysia to be of the same standard in every aspect. Food was fine I quite enjoyed it and drinks were plentiful.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,4,Travel from Sydney-KL MH142 and KL-Sydney. Everything was just average the food being served was horrible! I will not consider using this airline in the future.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,Travelled economy class from KL to Melbourne (MH147) on 6 Jan 14. Service was below average. Food was awful. Toilets were dirty.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,19th Jan 2014 SYD to KL A330-300. Beautiful aircraft I was seated in 21E. Flight time was 21.55pm departure and timely. Cabin crew were pleasant and attentive. Food was acceptable and crew worked all night on flight attending to seat calls. IFE very good selection. We had quite a bit of turbulence and flight deck crew kept us in the loop. All in all very pleased with Malaysia Airlines. Will fly again.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,Travelled A380 from LHR to KUL on 17/1 in 1st Class. Surprisingly although interior is less luxurious than SQ or EK but seat and ambience is cosy and inviting. Crew are as usually very attentive. Food is just average. Flight entertainment hardware system is not bad but need to improve on movies and TV programs list available particularly to those with interest in golf cars etc. none available. Perhaps need to provide wet towels more often as interior is too dry after long hours.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,My wife and I flew from Manila to Kuala Lumpur on January 30 2014. The check-in process is very antiquated. Long lines are not managed at all. Sure baggage allowance is generous. but in-flight service is atrocious. Food was terrible. Attitude of the staff was indifferent - they just did not care. We were glad when the flight was over.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Took MH1 flight from LHR-KUL and had an aisle seat in the economy class on the upper deck. Management of the queue at the gate was done in an organized and orderly manner and the staff were more than helpful. Since it was economy I didn't expect much because honestly one can only get that much of comfort in an economy class. There was an empty seat beside me so that gave me a good extra space. The in-flight entertainment had a good variety of movies music podcasts and e-books and the meals were great. The cabin crew displayed genuine friendliness and professionalism. My request for a cup of water was also immediately attended to. Overall I'd say the whole flight experience was great.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,5,We travelled Business Class from Sydney to Sri Lanka via Kuala Lumpur and back. The trip going to Sri Lanka was good. However on the return flight on the Colombo-KL sector they ran out of main course options. There were only 12 adults in Business Class and yet this happened. This is poor form for a business class service proposition. On the KL - Sydney sector they ran out of the amenities packs - when I requested a pack the hostess informed me that for some reason they had only loaded 50% of the required packs. Again they also ran out of the brunch options! Despite this the journey was comfortable and the staff very professional and pleasant. The trick might be to pre order your meal? Not sure.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,MH 126 PER to KUL in A330. Relatively new aircraft that was the only positive point. Boarding staff at the terminal were rude. The MH cabin crews were very indifferent and disinterested. I asked for a snack prior to take off but was not given anything no excuses given (did the same with Qantas and was given plenty). Meal was served with two main choices terribly bland. That was the only thing served throughout the entire 5 hours flight. Staff did not do their beverages round. Bad taste for IFE. All in all I think this would be my last trip with the MH. I am not impressed at all!
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,no,2,LHR to KL on A380 in business class then KL to Melbourne in business class. 3 hour delay at Heathrow not sure why as nobody seemed to know. Onboard seats ok and service was fines with plenty food and drinks the bad point being on arrival at KL no cases appeared. I only hope our cases come back with us on the return journey.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,Flew Melbourne to London return. Experience inferior to that 4 years ago. Paid extra for seat choice. Change of aircraft type meant chosen aisle seat became middle of 3. Service very impersonal. Would prefer quality food not quantity.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,yes,6,Flew business class January 2014 it was a special price. We usually fly Qantas or Singapore. No comparison in terms of inflight entertainment and seat comfort I found the staff of Malaysian hit and mostly miss. On our KL To Mumbai the staff were so disinterested it was almost amusing. I rarely eat the food my companions commented it was reasonable and all agreed. Inflight entertainment outdated and seat recline was good flat position was uncomfortable if you can get the special price it's worth it otherwise I would not be happy paying full price for this level of service. On time was always good. Flew Sydney to KL then KL to Mumbai Colombo to KL then KL to Sydney.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,MH767 SGN-KUL and MH020 KUL-CDG. The flight to Kuala Lumpur on a 737-800 was about 1hr 50 mins and the level of food service was extremely lavish for the length of the flight - very impressive. Unlike many airlines like BA where seats in both classes have the same seat pitch and are 3 adjustable seats either side of the aisle their business class comprises a permanent 2x2 layout with extra legroom. The flight to CDG was on an A380 Superjumbo. It was the quietest smoothest flight I have ever experienced. The seat food service and comfort were incredible. I arrived after some sleep feeling fresh and ready for another day. Malaysia Airlines are at the top of their game - I made a good choice.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,,,3,no,5,London to Australia via KL and return journey. Food was bland and the crew surly and rushed. Have had much better service with other airlines. Thumbs down.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,Melbourne to Paris return in Business. First time in Business on Malaysia. Previous experiences with airline had been mixed. Overall their Business product doesn't have the polish of Emirates or Singapore but is a satisfactory alternative given the price. 777 MEL-KUL A380 KUL-CDG-KUL and then A330 KUL-MEL. 777 is aged but found it very comfortable (more so than the much newer A330). A380 was spacious and seat was good. A330 seemed more cramped than either 777 or A380 and lacked privacy. All flights had good service. Food varied from good to excellent and there was always plenty of it. IFE was a weak spot with not much of any interest to me. Lounges too were mediocre even in KLIA which surprised me being home base. However despite all this given that the cost of the ticket was substantially less than any other carrier and comparable to China Southern it represents good value and would happily fly them again.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Flew business on A380 from KUL to LHR and return. Wasn't impressed with their business class offerings compared to EK Qantas or SQ. Comparable to the old biz class seats from their 777 and 747 which reclines at an angle. The saving grace for this airline is the exceptional crew. Genuine hospitality and very warm personnel. The highlight of this trip has be about how bad the food was. Was served satay which was excellent as usual but they now serve a menu done by Chef Zubir of Masterchef Malaysia. Huge disappointment. Beef ribs were inedible as it was tough changed to the cod which was surprisingly too sweet. Such a terrible experience for the price I paid and will certainly be avoiding MH in the future because the tremendous drop in quality.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Flew business class Perth (Australia) to Paris (France) in Dec 2013 and back in Jan 2014. Terrible experience both ways. Malaysia Airlines delayed flights to London Frankfurt and Paris for a handful of passengers delayed arriving in from Jakarta/Singapore (the stories differed) and showed no care that hundreds were inconvenienced when they should have instead re-booked those few late passengers. No-one took responsibility to help with onward travel plans that were now destroyed. Meals not great (not enough food to ensure your choice was met). Movies poor choice. On return trip a wailing child in the small economy section behind business class meant I could not sleep. It wailed for at least 9 hours. I paid for business class for the supposed comfort and experience. Let me tell you it is not worth it. Even had a crew member tut at me when I wasn't immediately ready with my breakfast choice (never mind she appeared out of nowhere with no warning that they were collecting breakfast choices). Lounges very poor - terrible toilet facilities and food just not up to scratch. I am extremely disappointed.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,KL to Sydney in business class on a new A330 airbus. Cabin crew were very attentive great in flight service drinks plentiful and food very good. I have no issues at all with the seat comfort and size. I am over 6 feet tall and I find the seat adequate for my needs. I continue to be very impressed by what great value for money Malaysia deliver in business class. I will be flying with them again no hesitation!
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Adelaide to KL on a A330 airbus in business class. Another great flight! I have only praise for the fantastic experience I continue to enjoy when flying Malaysia airlines. The food in particular on this flight was of a very high standard and worthy of mention.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,3,no,2,Flying KUL-CGK route MH very disappointing. Still using an old B737-800 aircraft. Cabin interior looks old and boring. The seat cannot be recline. The meal was very simple only rice curry fish and boiled vegetable which had no taste. The service was very slow. Passenger beside me order a nescafe one hour before landing. However up until landing the plane was still not served. Staff apologized and offered the salted nuts snack. No entertainment on board this was an international route and a 2 hour flight.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,KL to London on A380 in business class. This was sadly the last of my 4 flights on my Malaysia/Australia holiday. I started by holiday on an A380 in business from London to KL and what a great way to finish! I can honestly say that out of all the airlines that I have flown with in business class Malaysia beats the competition hands down. The A380 experience in business class is just fantastic. None of my 4 flights disappointed.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Travelled on MH1 LHR-KUL 3 Jan as part of an American Airlines ticket originating in West Palm Beach via Chicago and London. The seat comfort on the A380 lower deck is as spacious as it is on the upper deck. The wide seats and the legroom made the journey most pleasant. The meals were sumptuous and the service is beyond expectation. Crew were definitely top notch. I have never had a comfortable long haul flight in economy in over 20 years when legroom started shrinking.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,5,no,3,MH17 Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur 3 January 2014 Business class on 777. Seat was outdated and uncomfortable. Cabin crew were not helpful and attentive. Catering was really bad and disappointing. Garlic bread was inedible and hard as a rock. Meals were ordered through Chef-on-Call but was given different meals. Cabin crew replied 'maybe they thought rice and potatoes were the same' when I asked about the meal. IFE was not updated and still showing last month movies and TV programs. Definitely not a 5-star airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Kuala Lumpur - Bangkok on Dec 30th. After reading the mixed reviews of this airline I was somewhat sceptical of flying with them. Old tatty Boeing plane from beginning of the 90's so worn out and tired cabin. Seats and tables were broken to the point where the entire seat row wouldn't recline. Food was actually inedible which is bizarre for a 5 star rated airline even air Asia can offer tasty dishes. First time on premium airline I had to return the food. FA's were efficient and courteous in service. There was absolutely no point in paying more flying with MH on this route. Will not be flying further with them.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Travelled on MH1 LHR-KUL 3 Jan as part of an American Airlines ticket originating in West Palm Beach via Chicago and London. The seat comfort on the A380 lower deck is as spacious as it is on the upper deck. The wide seats and the legroom made the journey most pleasant. The meals were sumptuous and the service is beyond expectation. Crew were definitely top notch. I have never had a comfortable long haul flight in economy in over 20 years when legroom started shrinking.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,no,5,Kuala Lumpur to Perth in business. The KLIA lounge was really poor and thought the on board product would impress me. Obviously I was wrong no clear indication of priority boarding (so I queued for a long time before getting into the plane). Cabin was clean no doubt. However there was no personal storage compartment at all in this 'new business class seat'. Nowhere to put my ipad book headset etc. Asked the staff she said just put them on your seat? Seat was hard and didn't seem to support lumbar. Had to put a pillow under my neck to make it bearable. I tried so many configurations and I couldn't lie comfortably to sleep so I stayed up! I'm quite tall (179cm) and the angled lie flat seat was too short for me. I kept sliding down then hit the foot rest and exerted pressure on my legs. No amenity bags of any kind. Seat pitch was good but really tight seat width! Poor seat. In saying that the cabin crews were professional efficient and friendly. Satay was great. Though I didn't understand why did they put the dessert on the table even before main was served? Substandard IFE selection couldn't find anything to watch. I noticed they only had ONE kids movie! Really?! Its poor product cannot be fully complimented by their great cabin crews. MH really needs to think about their product offering to stay competitive. It was overall ok but not great or even good and Certainly not 5-star!
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,yes,5,Travel very frequently using domestic route KUL-BKI. I'm not a fan of airline food they are all bland especially when you are travelling domestic economy. But this particular trends get my attention. Back in 2011 the food was very good: 2 selections of Malaysian dishes (chicken or fish) with dessert (normally Kit Kat and fruit slices). Then in 2012-2013 the fruit slices were gone. My latest trip on 6-8 Jan 2014 we were given only the main dishes no dessert / appetizer. Looks like they are not even trying to improve the main dishes and lack of creativity. Not sure if this is the cost cutting measure they are trying to pull but it is not worth the money you are paying for full service carrier. And the cabin crew for domestic flight is OK (since there's no other FSC operating on that route). The Enrich miles program is good though love it when they made Miles promotion last December. But I've seen better from the other carriers.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,4,yes,5,PER-AMS-PER in business. Malaysia airlines feels like a cut price airline rather than 5 star. Fare competitive and significantly less than other carriers. Lounges substandard especially in KL. No alcoholic drinks pre takeoff. 777 quite old and seats angled although reasonably comfortable. Service variable: professional on outward and staff called you by name. Unpolished and unfriendly on way back. Food terrible; brunch of vegetable fritatta with chicken sausage truly revolting and almost the only meal I haven't been able to eat in my life! Most carriers would consider this meal too substandard to serve in any class let alone business. Malaysia is ok if you are paying a discounted fare but avoid it otherwise.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,MH21 1 Dec 2013 Paris-KL. MH131 2 Dec 2013 KL-Auckland. My flight from Paris to KL was the best experience I have had on a plane. The plane was clean and new looking the food was great the staff were brilliant. When I jumped on my second MA flight from KL to Auckland it didn't compare at all to my first flight: the plane interior was shabby and the service was half of that of the Paris-KL service. Regardless of the second experience I still rate Malaysian Airlines as a brilliant economy-service airline.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,5,Took return flights to Australia via KL. Don't understand how MA qualify for 5 star rating. Outbound flights 17 Oct were both night flights from Heathrow and KL MH001 and MH123. First time travelling Business Class and didn't come up to expectations. Crew were noticeable by their absence and surly when present. Hospitality from the crew was minimal and not a smile in sight. Quality and choice of the food was disappointing lacking imagination. Return flights from Melbourne 04 Dec via KL. Both daytime flights MH148 and MH004 Crew were much better they seemed to want to deliver a good personable service making both return flights more enjoyable. Unfortunately the food again lacked imagination and therefore disappointing. To summarise standards of the crews on aircraft are inconsistent so its pot luck whether you have an enjoyable flight or not and food was consistently poor.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,no,6,HKG to KUL business class on A380. The business class product on this short flight was disappointing. The service was mediocre and food poor. My chair could not recline and luckily the seat next to me was empty and could be used. The upper deck business cabin lacks privacy and even though the seats are lie flat it was not comfortable. The IFE is adequate but pales in comparison to Emirates or Cathay. Headsets were given out 30 mins after take off and collected back 30 mins before landing! In Cathay the headsets are already attached at the seat and can be used throughout the flight. MAS has a long way to go to catching up with its competitors and it does not feel like a 5 star airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,4,yes,5,Recently travelled to Bangkok from Kuala Lumpur. KUL-BKK was codeshare with Thai Airways so I had a chance to compare with Malaysia Airlines. BKK-KUL was operated on a B737-800. The seat pitch of this particular B737-800 was only 30' which was extremely tight! Like many reviews here it was way too tight even for a 2 hours flight. I am 178cm and I found some difficulties to sit comfortably on that seat for even 1 hour! Cant imagine how could they use this configuration as in LCC. They really need to do something on this! Cabin crews were slightly inorganic but efficient and generally responded well to requests though at times without a smile! The meal service was somehow pathetic: a small noodles with a small kitkat bar and a bite-size banana cake and all were quite tasteless. IFE option was substantially less compared to their Medium-Long haul flights: only a few movies and TV series. In comparison Thai Airways was far more comfortable as the seat pitch was at 34' and it offered a full meal service with a smile too! What a shame that I feel MH could do so much more!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,LHR - Jakarta on A380. I booked on MH as I'd read about the kid-free zone on the upper deck economy class cabin. This is not the case at all. In fact there seemed to be more babies and toddlers in this cabin than elsewhere on the aircraft! Overall the flight was fine which is probably about as much as you can hope for in Y class. Crew were efficient food was adequate although I'd have preferred sandwiches and a piece of fruit in the snack pack rather than peanuts and cookies. The IFE is reasonable but not as good as other 5* airlines. Similarly there were no little extras such as hot towels menus or amenity kits. Overall it didn't feel particularly 5 stars.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,1,HKG-KUL on 1/1/14 on the last MAS flight of the day. 737-800 refit has an extremely tight seat pitch configuration and this really affected comfort on the flight. The cabin crew did a really good job but when someone reclines it makes you feel claustrophobic so you need to stand up for a while then there is a problem. For anyone who wants to fly this airline between Hong Kong and KL I would recommend going for one of the earlier services on the A330-300 or the A380 where the seat configuration is more suitable. The 737s should be reserved for flights under 2hrs. Normally I would recommend this airline for long haul but for regional services I have been extremely disappointed.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,yes,7,LHR-BKK-LHR. First the good. Flights were on time and bags arrived quickly and their cabin crew are great. The A380 was extremely comfortable particularly their flat bed. However we were a bit underwhelmed with the quality/choice of the food and drink on the intercontinental sectors (KUL-BKK-KUL was quite the opposite). Also although we flew on 4 January they AVOD system still only had December's programmes available. Don't know if this affected all MH flights or only our A380. Pretty poor though.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,Adelaide-Kuala Lumpur-Beijing. Happy with the Business Class product offered by Malaysia Airlines but if this airline wants to compete with the new player on the block in Adelaide Air Asia then clean the fuselages of your aeroplanes! A clean white Air Asia A330 (yes in all white colour) pulling up alongside Malaysia's sooty white fuselage is not a good look. Also noticed a dirty A330 at KL so ours was not a one off. Also hoping Business Class lounge at KL will be re-opened soon. One small gripe about food service lunch out of Adelaide was served at 11.30am after a 10 am departure. Was too soon. Two years ago a light breakfast was served with lunch later in the flight. Maybe a cost cutting exercise?
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,5,yes,6,KUL-DPS on B777-200ER Business Class. The 16-year old plane is overly-dated together with its interior. Don't get me wrong the interior was nice and clean but you would know that the plane is from the last century. The good part is that the seat was less sophisticated than the newer planes meaning the leg-room is extremely spacious. Cabin crews are polite and nice but the food needs to be improved. Look forward to Malaysia Airlines replacing all of its B777-200 with A330-300 over the next 2 years. In the mean time Malaysia Airlines will be milking these workhorse planes prior to retirement meaning their Business Class tickets on B777-200 will competitively priced in the market.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,3,no,6,"Flew from London Heathrow to Sydney on 21st December 2013. Have flown with them several times previously and was always happy with the service. On this particular occasion I was disappointed. Both flights (LHR-KUL and KUL- SYD) were pretty full. In-flight service was interrupted several times by turbulence. I fly MH because of the 34"" seat pitch in Economy but on these two flights I felt like the space had been reduced somewhat. The food was awful out of four meals served only one was edible. Would I fly with them again? Possibly if there was a sale on airfares."
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,1,no,3,"Kuala Lumpur - Ho Chi Minh. My family and I took a 2 hour flight to Ho Chi Minh for our Christmas vacation on the latest Boeing 737-800 plane. However the flight was not pleasant at all. The plane had poor ventilation and it was an afternoon flight and as the sun shone through the cabin it made the cabin very stuffy and warm. Meal on board had 2 varieties for Economy Class a chicken and a fish. The stewardess attitude does not even reflect what MAS to claim ""Best Cabin Crew"" or ""Malaysian Hospitality"". She barely smiled. Disappointed."
,,,First Class,,,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,3,no,2,MH72 KUL-HKG. Was looking forward to flying the A380 in First as I prefer Asian carriers for travel. Airport check-in was fast and I was greatly relieved as there were huge lines for Business and Economy. The First Class Lounge is closed for refurb and the Business Lounge needs a refurb too. Boarding was easy. First has a separate entrance directly into the cabin. There are 8 seats and nothing special. The crew were very pleasant and the Dom Perignon champagne was great. The A380 already looked tired. I walked through the whole plane and was not impressed. The FC Galley is located directly behind the cabin which separates it from Economy. I don't know what they were thinking in this design. Luckily it was a short flight so all the clanging and banging didn't bother me. Had this been a long flight I would have been very upset. The menu was fairly minimal for the short brunch flight. I picked the lamb dish which wasn't bad but strange there was no salad offer. Dessert was an unopened carton of Haagan Daz with a plastic spoon. Next time I'll stick with Cathay or Japan Airlines.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,,,3,no,4,"CDG-KUL-DPS and return end November mid December. Out on their A380 to KL and then a B777 on to Bali back on a 737 to KL and then A380 again home to France. Having flown business and even first class on other airlines of 4 and 5 star rating I cannot understand how MH have kept their 5 star rating particularly when it comes to ""food and beverages"". Food out more or less inedible their signature dish was OK but lukewarm main course burnt cheese course didn't appear and the desert was like eating cardboard (another signature dish). Food back sadly was the same although we were hoping for something better out of KL. The flights were on time and the cabin crew did their job no lost luggage. One of the toilets was out of use for the 13 hour flight back from KL to Paris but that happens. It was the best deal at that time from CDG to DPS but won't be flying with them again."
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,3,no,3,I have been using MAS to get in and out of Yangon in the last few months (10 sectors so far). I switched to them because they have good business fares that beat anything Silk Air or SIA have. It makes it worth the extra 44 minutes into KLIA out of Changi. Unfortunately in the last 3 trips I have seen 3 cancellations 5 delays and was at one point directed to 4 different gates over 5 hours for a flight from KLIA to Changi. Last trip out of Yangon was two hours late and I missed my connection in KLIA then got downgraded to economy and waited for two hours for the flight. So to make a long story short I am back flying Silk Air. It might be twice the price but they get you there on time and planning connections is possible. I like the MAS cabin crew and the product but the on time performance just keeps getting worse and KLIA is a train wreck.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,2,yes,5,KUL-CGK previously had wide body flight at least once a day. Now all served using 737-8 which is small and crowded. Food desperately needs improvement as it is tasteless. Paying for the most expensive flight for this route when other bigger plane like KLM is just half the price of MAS with better inside facility but food and steward/ess are lousy.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,BNE-KUL-HKT 20th December. Timing of the Brisbane to Kuala Lumpur flight is such that you just want to get on the plane have a drink and try and sleep so not having a big meal served for me made perfect sense. Breakfast was more important and it was great without hot meal which I did not fancy. Good legroom in economy on the A330-300 smooth take-off and landings and friendly cabin service make MAS one of my favourite choices up to Kuala Lumpur. Onward flight to Phuket was pretty cramped but over quickly so my ratings are for Australia to Malaysia only.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Brisbane to KL 15 November 2013 and returned on 23 November 2013. Travelled to Penang on 20th November and left Penang for KL and then to Brisbane on 23 November. Malaysia Airlines is one of the worst to fly with. The service is poor and on the trip there was no dinner given to passengers. No drinks were offered and when I asked for water it was ignored. On the way back we got no food except for a snack and then the meal was served just an hour before the plane landed at Brisbane Airport. I wont be flying them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I have been working in Brunei for the last 2.5 years so I am a frequent flier. My flight route takes me from ABZ to Miri via LHR and KL. The A380 airbus is an excellent plane it is roomy new and fresh. The cabin staff are a wonderful bunch who are always willing to help. I am extremely happy with all aspects Malaysia airlines have to offer from the airport itself to the lounges and most of all the wonderful Malay people. My baggage has never gone missing as things are very well organised. I have now reached platinum status and will continue to fly with MA for the foreseeable future.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,KUL-CDG 13 Dec on the A380 Upper Deck with family. Excellent and impeccable service provided by crew. Meals were sumptuous especially the quiche before landing.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,MH1 London to KL 11th Dec 2013 on A380. Fantastic experience for the moment I arrived at check in until I disembarked at KL. I missed my original flight (MH3) due to fog at London and was re-booked onto MH1. Lounge staff made the 8 hour wait a pleasure! The crew on the flight were excellent as was the food and service. (I was addressed by name frequently). The drinks just kept coming. The food was outstanding the best business food I have had large portions and each component cooked separately and assembled on the plate not all heated together on the same plate and served. They had taken time with the food and it showed. Very comfortable and roomy seats I am 6 feet 1 inch tall and had no issues at all even managed 6 hours sleep no problem with the bed comfort. If you are looking for a quality business product at an affordable price look no further.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Disappointed with the services. Travelled from Phuket to Kuala Lumpur on MH787. The meal that I had pre-ordered was not provided. I ordered a seafood meal and got the vegetarian meal the flight attendant said there was nothing but pasta left - tasted horrible. When I asked for orange juice the flight attendant said all she had left was apple juice. No apologies just take it or leave it. When I requested headphones I was told the flight was too short! So I watched a silent movie for 1.5 hours. However on the flight I took from Kuala Lumpur to Phuket headphones were given to all passengers without requesting them. I don't expect this kind of service from a 5 star airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,Flew from LAX-NRT-KUL-BLR. The service was really good the cabin crew were very courteous. Seating was quite comfortable. Food was great - enjoyed it but the airline fleet was a bit old. The Inflight screens were very old on 777-200LR from LAX to NRT the windows were scratched from KUL-BLR no personal screens on 737-800. Overall the airline fleet was old.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,PEK-KUL on a cold and sunny late November morning in a B777-200. Flight not fully booked business class with roughly 60% occupancy. Plane left Beijing/Peking with a few minutes delay and had good tailwinds arriving in KL ahead of schedule. Seat comfort ok did not perform a thorough test of all technical options. The flight time of almost 6 hours gave the crew enough time to unwind all the famous service features of Malaysian and their personal charm as well: Food (brunch) superb and in generous rations - did not get my favourite choice due to limited stock but the alternative was really ok too. Beverage selection almost at the level of intercontinental first class but being a morning departure at 9am I restricted myself just the champagne and the white wine. The crew addressed the passengers by name. One hour before landing they offered their well known Satay service - this time lamb and chicken - and underlined their excellent service reputation. AVOD ok more options than I could ever use - I had to concentrate on F&B. Choice of newspapers and magazines limited compared to top European competitors.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,7,"Flight MH 006 KUL-FRA on a B777-200ER was delayed (just as all other MH flights bound for Europe this very night) by about 90 min thus the plane left shortly before 1.30am made up almost an hour en-route and arrived 20 minutes late in FRA. Information policy on these and other delays was mediocre airport announcements given in English were almost incomprehensible (not an MH fault). After boarding there was only a brief apology for the delay no details given. The plane seemed fully booked did not see any vacant seat in front. Welcome drinks offered were non-alcoholic chilled and delicious. With the first beverage service at about 2.15am I tried to have a glass of champagne - got it and it was lukewarm like a cup of tea after 10 minutes. Tried to switch to the white Burgundy and later to the Mosella Riesling - all the same completely unacceptable. They tried to get me a cool glass of wine but had no ice cubes or dry ice (as other airlines use) and so there was no way. During the Satay service I was thus forced to switch to their red wine choices first took a glass of tasty Crozes Hermitage when I had almost finished the glass one too eager hostess filled this glass up with a standard Bordeaux - at almost 3 am I was not in the mood anymore to ask for a new service. This spoiled the whole meal service of course. The generous and high quality supper absolutely matched the expectations you have when you sit in a better class of a five star airline. My wife not drinking any alcohol was therefore extremely content with the service level offered. Seat quality fully ok not full flat seating but comfortable - had some good hours of sleep across Asia. AVOD was ok as well but the screen offered only limited resolution ""of times long gone by"". This should be addressed and resolved immediately. Breakfast in the morning was again of outstanding quality and variety able to feed hungry lions - really superb. I would have given a 9 or even 10 without the problems mentioned (so does my wife) but this flight showed that there is something to improve in the control processes."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Horrendous experience flying from London via Kuala Lumpur to Yangon. Flight MH3 was delayed by over 22 hours from 10.50 on 8/11/13 to 09.00 on 9/11/13 following a technical issue causing it to return to Kuala Lumpur. There was no attempt at warning anyone who was already checked in not to leave home very early to get to the airport even when the travel agent had over 25 people travelling. Unfortunately it then got worse. Returning to the airport on 9/11/13 I was unable to check in because no onward flights from Kuala Lumpur to Yangon were booked or available even though the previous day we had been reassured it would all be done and the travel agent had also been reassured. For the next 4 hours I had to queue at Customer Services hoping I wouldn't lose another day of my holiday. All they really seemed to want is for me to cancel the flight and go away. Eventually I travelled on Thai Airways and Bangkok Airways to Yangon who were great but the planes was full because of Malaysia Airlines. My luggage even managed to keep up. I tried to complain at Kuala Lumpur airport on my return journey but even the Duty Manager was not interested. The last few times I travelled with Malaysia Airlines they were really good but I won't bother again not after this experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I always try to travel Malaysia Airlines to Australia and I travel a couple of times a year. Last trip was fantastic with the new plane but the main benefit is their brilliant customer service if something goes wrong. I've had to change my flight return several times with other airlines and nothing has beaten the sympathetic and efficient service of Malaysia Airlines. I always travel economy.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,"CDG-KUL-CDG. I recently flew from CDG-KUL-CDG. I flew on the latest A380. The aircraft was new and spotless. The check-in was smooth the departure was on time. The flight crew were excellent. The inflight meals were tasty and adequate. I loved the breakfast which was shrimp and rice it was delicious. The cabin crew were friendly and kept smiling with professionalism. The IFE system was superb lots of variety and excellent touch-screen monitor. The seat was very comfortable and I had a wonderful sleep with enough legroom (I'm 6'2""). Overall I was very much satisfied with this airline and I wouldn't hesitate to fly them again."
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,2,no,2,SYD-KUL-LGK-KUL-SYD: Firstly the long haul flights. SYD-KUL flight was on an aged B777-200 with small television screens and old broken seats. KUL-SYD flight was on a fairly new A330-300. The return flight landed 30 minutes late primarily due to the fact that it took the ground crew an hour to board the plane. On both flights the cabin crew were rude surly and inefficient. The food was generally appalling especially the sausage roll served two hours before landing and poorly planned with wine served mid morning and tea served in the afternoon. Drink runs were lacking on the both flights especially the return flight where I had to suggest that the cabin crew make one and even then they missed several rows of seats. The KUL-LGK-KUL flights were both serviced by extremely old B737-400. The fact that MAS still operates these planes is a disgrace. The interior was extremely dated the seats were broken and the air conditioner works poorly on the ground. The return flight landed 45 minutes late in KUL due to problems with the air conditioner. The cabin crew were younger and generally more pleasant on these flights. Overall MAS is inconsistent the cabins are dirty and I am baffled how it achieved the 5 star airline status.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,We can not fault their services at all. The flight to Thailand and then to Phuket were as smooth as the travel back to Australia. They catered for my husband who requested that if there was a possibility of getting a seat with more leg room could they let him know and they did. My boys requested for drinks and nibbles and got them pronto. Will definitely be flying Malaysia again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,,3,yes,5,JHB (Johor Bahru Malaysia) - KUL - KIX (KansaiJapan) on 18 Nov. Firstly JHB-KUL included service beverages and refreshments. But the flight from KUL-KIX was delayed 3 hours. Because the flight was full some passengers could upgrade from economy to business class for free and they just bought their tickets below RM 900 (JB-KUL-KIX). The provided breakfast was ok. Friendly crew on the flight a smooth landing at Kansai Airport.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,5,yes,7,Flew last month with their leased b737-800 KUL-KCH. Cabin well kept. Not great like their new sky interior. Seat comfortable on this route. Cabin crew service was excellent. Friendly full of smiles helpful and professional.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,LHR-KUL-LHR. Booked this flight at a very reasonable price. The check-in was smooth ground staff really helpful as I lost my way to the gate. Cabin clean bright and new. Seats are comfortable after reclining it legroom was more than enough. Food served was tasty and comparable with other airlines such as Emirates Singapore Airlines and Qatar. IFE was installed with good selection of movies I could whatever I wanted. Throughout the flight the Cabin Crews were efficient and always smiling. Same service coming back too. Malaysia Airlines is really a great airline will not hesitate to fly them again.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,London to Kuala Lumpur 26/11/13 on A380. Flew business class to KL from Heathrow the plane was spotless upon boarding many pleasantries from the well presented cabin crew very helpful and obliging. Great food as well. Only a slight nag if you are taller than 5ft 10 then the flat bed is too short between the head board and the back of the seat in front ie you cant stretch out on your back to sleep. Other than that great experience and I am flying back in a few days on the 23.55 back to LHR - I hope it will be the same experience apart from the bed.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,no,6,Flew SIN-KUL-BNE return in business class. 737-800 for Singapore-KL and A330-300 for KL-Brisbane. 737 nice new planes and only a 45 min flight - service efficient but naturally basic. KL-BNE was day flight. Took off at 10am and the first meal service was 2 sandwiches and some fruit. There was then no other food served until 2 hours from Brisbane. What food was served was of a good quality but why it wasn't the other way around in terms of meals I really couldn't understand. Considering it is a reasonably new product I was very disappointed by the seat on the A330. It is narrow hard and doesn't got flat which on the night flight back from Brisbane makes a huge difference I think MAS are good and the value for money was very good but this is not a 5 star airline not even close. Compared to Qatar/Cathay etc they are miles behind.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,Flew NRT-KUL on the Boeing 777-200. It was a midnight flight on a clean spacious and comfortable seat. Slept very well the food was above average. The IFE was great as latest movies was installed. Crew was offering water through the whole flight. Overall Malaysia Airline's service really suits the 5-star awards.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Although I do undertake around 10 long-haul trips per year this trip from Kuala Lumpur to Amsterdam was my first leg with Malaysian Airlines. It was a bit of a disappointment as I had been looking forward to a new experience. I felt the cabin service was not of the quality expected and experienced with most other airlines. There was no eye contact and no smiles. There was an air of impatience too if a request for say a choice of main course required a second look at the menu. I just felt my server just wanted the chore of serving passengers to be completed as soon as possible. Having said that the flight was conducted professionally with pre-take off and landing checks in the cabin being completed diligently. I hesitate to recommend but this was of course a first time experience perhaps future trips would be better.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,5,We flew out of Perth November 5th on a late afternoon flight to KL and then on to Narita late evening. Dinner served an hour or so after takeoff. Then came an announcement that due to turbulence hot beverage service would be terminated seat belt sign went on and crew disappeared. Turbulence was minimal and we wondered what the fuss was about. During the early evening lights were dimmed and crew conspicuous by their absence and were not really seen until close to KL. Passengers observed going to galley and having to ask for water. The flight on to Narita followed the same pattern turbulence lights dimmed and little crew service. We had not flown with Malaysia for a long time and wondered if this was their normal standard of service and would it be the same again for our return journey. We departed Narita on the 19th late evening and our first observations were that we must be flying with a different airline! Service was great and crew pleasant and attentive at all times. Yes the announcement about turbulence was made and the seat belt sign came on but this did not faze the crew. The same excellent service was given on the KL to Perth sector.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5,yes,10,KUL-JHB with old 737-400. IFE was not installed but the seat is very large and comfortable. The flight attendant was hospitable and very polite. Refreshment was good during this short flight. Recommend to everyone for this 5-star service.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,KUL-BKK-KUL. Overall Malaysia airlines provided the best service on my flight. Nice crews good entertainment comfortable seats new aircraft and etc. The only imperfection was the food not tasty and a low class menu. Anyway I'll still fly with MH again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,SYD-KUL-KIX and back. All flights full. Excellent service lots and lots of food snacks cabin crew always offering drinks. IFE was good. Seats had lots of legroom and recline. Seats also very comfortable. Cabin crew very friendly however only one female cabin crew on first flight SYD to KUL who was in business class very surprising. Overall a pleasant experience. KLIA is a great airport to stopover at. Highly recommend Malaysia Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,I decided to go with Malaysia Airlines instead of Jetstar because you get full service meals drinks entertainment etc but it was a horrible old plane food inedible costing me around $1000 from Melbourne to Phnom Penh. Rude staff uncomfortable seating (economy) poor selection of entertainment. Coming back to Melbourne I was seated at the back right next to the toilets smelt horrible. Never again.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,7,MAS operates old B777 on FRA to KL with no full flat bed and seat layout is 2x3x2. Service is perfect food and wine excellent. They deserve more attention and a full flat bed in Business class.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,KL to Hanoi on B737-800. MAS are making significant efforts to compete. Their service is outstanding quality of food and wine very good. Seat comfort on the short haul flights is similar to other airlines in 2x2 configuration aircraft quite new. MAS provides prices which are almost always lower than Thai or CX not to mention SIA.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,4,no,3,"Hong Kong to KL to Adelaide a bad day for Malaysia Airlines. Scheduled departure 2:40pm but major delay to aircraft arriving. Departure estimated to be 4:30pm but eventually closer to 6:00pm. Captain cited technical issues but no other explanation. Flight OK up until half hour out of KL. Entered holding pattern due to ""traffic conditions"" at KLIA. We were not too concerned as we had experienced something similar flying in from Adelaide a few days earlier but by now we had eaten up our 4 hour transit to catch a connection home. After 3 or 4 circuitsthe co-pilot announced some ""unexpected news"" that we were diverting to Penang due to the fuel situation. We proceeded to Penang with a later assurance that we had plenty of fuel to get there. In my experience most airlines have problems from time to time with weather equipment and other factors out of their control but it is how they handle the situation and their paying customers that is a true measure of their quality. This situation unfortunately highlighted some deficiencies with Malaysian Airlines systems and processes. We got plenty of apologies but not much more. On landing at Penang we were given very little information about what would happen. We got the usual announcements about not moving until the seat belt light goes out but nothing about what would happen next. Passengers gathered their possessions and stood up expecting to disembark but silence. Eventually after about half an hour the pilot announced that the flight crew had exceeded their allowed flying time and another crew would need to be flown up from KL to fly the aircraft back and this would be about 12:30am ( we landed at about 9:30pm). So there we sat for 3 hours. The cabin crew were conspicuous by their absence and it was hard to identify anyone in charge. Very little attempt was made to make an effort to look after the comfort of the passengers and almost no information or updates were passed on until the replacement crew arrived around midnight. Of course the headphones had been collected before landing so we could not pass the time watching a movie. It was possible to go and get a drink from the galley if you were able to get past the groups of agitated passengers. Eventually we left around 1am and arrived at 2am at KL. On arrival we were given vouchers for hotel and taxi and boarding passes for a flight to Adelaide the following evening and pushed out of the airport without our luggage. I suppose we should be grateful that Malaysian Airlines found accommodation for us but it was in a village called Sepang about half an hour from the airport and while rated 3 stars I think this would be rather optimistic. I could not help thinking that this was a pretty cheap effort and this was reinforced by the expression on the face of one of the ground staff who asked us where we had been accommodated. In the end we arrived home 24hours late and minus one bag. This experience raised many questions about Malaysia Airlines' commitment to passenger satisfaction and comfort their cabin crew organisation the suitability of KLIA as a hub their fueling policies and procedures and their management in general. It is hard to imagine a circumstance where I would consider travelling with them again."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,4,yes,6,KUL to SYD - flight delayed because baggage can't be loaded problem was not MAS but airport facilities in KL. Kept informed by Captain whom decided to leave without some bags rather than indefinite delay - fair enough. Very full flight and extraordinary number of small babies - all of whom wailed on take off and landing. Cramped and noisy flight. Difficult seating arrangements for families especially those with small children and babies. Cabin crew civil but not usual friendly service. Filthy toilets but some what understandable given the very full flight and origin of some passengers. I do wish they'd managed more cleaning of the toilets but the state of the cabin on landing is horrendous. My bag didn't arrive on the same flight and was delivered the next day. I imagine this was just awful for many people but I coped ok till the next day. All this is within reason and managed as best as possible. My big complaint is the food. The second 'snack' of the sausage roll really needs to be changed. How many people have to complain before the airline does something about this. Why be known as the airline that you have to bring your own food before you fly? Change the sausage roll it truly deserves to be dropped. It is horrendous and it's the first and last thing I think of when flying MAS economy.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,2,no,1,Adelaide-KL-Phuket return. Firstly they ran late for every flight. No drinks regularly offered you had to ask constantly for water cups of tea and coffee served with powdered milk. The food is disgusting dried up pastry sausage roll. The meals were awful and half the food was left off my husbands tray. Our final journey KL to Adelaide I just wanted to cry I was so uncomfortable in my seat.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,IST-KUL-BNE in late October. We fly annually to Europe with MAS. The service only seems to get better. The cabin crew were uniformly helpful and pleasant. Food and beverage service very good. The only area needing improvement is their lounge at KL which is getting a bit tired and at times very crowded. Also the lounge used at Istanbul being the Millenium Lounge is an embarrassment. Any of the other lounges would be a better choice by MAS. We will continue to fly Malaysia Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,3,Over the years Malaysia Airlines is going bad. The service is one of the worst I have ever had. Heard a lot of people say the cabin crew treat Asians differently if compared to Europeans. I guess where you come from affects their service towards you. Everything in Malaysia Airlines is downgraded the comfort the services the food etc.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LHR-KUL-SYD in Business class. LHR-KUL on the A380. Check-in agent at LHR very friendly and advised of fast-track through security and location of lounge. First class lounge (due to OneWorld Emerald status) very nice with great views of the tarmac and having a good selection of food at the buffet stand. A-la-carte menu was of excellent quality. The staff at the lounge were very helpful friendly and accommodating making the experience a complete pleasure. Priority boarding not quite what it should be as there is a boarding gate for business class passengers and economy passengers on the upper deck who board together and a separate boarding gate for first class passengers and economy passengers on the lower deck. Despite this boarding was relatively quick orderly and efficient. Non-alcoholic pre- departure drinks offered. Flight was delayed due to a crew member being injured prior to departure and they had to wait for a replacement crew to arrive. Seat was very comfortable in both the sitting and flat positions. There was also plenty of storage space for personal items. Good selection of IFE with a reasonable amount of latest releases. Cabin crew were excellent on this sector. They were very friendly and helpful throughout the flight. Pre-ordered meal through their Chef-on-call service was honoured. Quality of meals on this sector was quite good. Flight arrived late into KUL but some time was made up in the air. However it meant that the connection for the flight to SYD was still a bit tight. KUL-SYD was on a new A330-300. This flight was held back to ensure that connecting passengers and their luggage made it onto the flight which was much appreciated. Cabin crew again were great on this flight. My pre- ordered meal was honoured and it was excellent. This was probably the best steak I've ever had in the air! The satay of course was excellent. IFE similar to what was on offer on the A380 flight from LHR to KUL. The seat is comfortable in the sitting position but not so much in the angled flat position. Storage space for personal items is very poor on these seats. Flight arrived an hour late into SYD. Check-in luggage did make it through but did not come out first. However I was just glad that the luggage made it to SYD. Overall a great experience and one that I will continue to use due to the consistency of service standards and good value for money.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,,5,no,7,Travelled London to Melbourne and return via Kuala Lumpur on A380 and A330. What was otherwise a pleasant journey was marred by poor quality of food served on all 4 legs.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,MEL-KUL-PNH/BKK-KUL-MEL. Everything was just ok not fantastic with this so-called 5 star airline. The most disappointing was the catering - very average. How could they serve us a below-par sausage roll for a main meal. I noted they are cutting corner with food. Why? I don't know. The best was 30 kg luggage allowance and that's all. Will fly with them again if the price is right (cheap) but have to bring my own food along.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,6,SYD-KUL-CGK-KUL-PEK PVG-KUL-SYD in Business. I have to say the service improved a lot with MH this time. Not every leg was great but I have to say most of legs are better than I expected and better than my last experience with MH. I discovered I could use QF first lounge in SYD as a Emerald member great experience as always. service between SYD KUL SYD are better than medium haul such as KUL-PEK and PVG-KUL. KUL-CGK-KUL legs are okay but nothing special. For 2 hours flights it is okay. No toiletry bags was distributed for 6 hours flight from KUL to PEK. PVG-KUL leg was not great one of staff in business class was really unprofessional. I ordered chef on demand when I booked my ticket but seem they mixed up my booking. Never mind the staff member was really unprofessional could not care less it is airline mixed up the meals. The flight could not land in KL due to the bad weather. We have to land in Penang and waited for two more hours. First lounge in KL is good but so dated. I think MH is going to do some renovation. Seats are not great you can only have 3 positions and not designed for lounging only for sit and sleep. It was a much better trip than my previous trip with MH. I hope MH could keep it up as I am going to travel again in couple of weeks.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,My wife and I travelled from London to KL on MH3. 10.50am on 29th Oct 2013. I would like to comment about the food. The fruits were either too hard or too soft. It would be better to serve only ripe fruits as the rest is inedible. Chose fruits that travel well and put them together. The watermelon was over-ripe and the kiwi fruit was rock hard. Also the satay beef was too dry. This is the second time I have noticed this in Business class recently.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,KUL-CDG. Experienced a wonderful time on board the MAS A380. FA's were extremely attentive friendly nonetheless. The reclined seat was comfortable. IFE was OK with a variety of international and local films. Worth every penny flying with MAS. Highly recommended to all.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,3,no,7,Flew Malaysia Airlines 4 times in the last month. The flight departing Kuala Lumpur to Sydney at 22.50 provided no evening meal but a snack only. This turned out to be an inedible mushroom sausage roll. The alternative (non vegetarian) was not available. This is clearly inadequate for a 5 star airline particularly as we had been on a connecting flight with a 3 hour transit at KL and the breakfast serving would not be for 5 hours. Malaysia certainly need to lift their catering for long haul flights.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Flight MH001 - LHR-KL. In a word excellent. IFE food comfort and service cannot be faulted. Clean spacious A380 professional cabin crew. Flight MH1164 - KL-PEN. Good efficient short-haul connection.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,"Firstly we arrived at Melbourne Airport with a stack of ski gear right up to our luggage limit. One of us was over one under - one spot on. The lady just asked for passports and said ""they're being strict on the luggage tonight just shuffle some stuff between the bags and I'll weigh them again"". We got the same at Narita on the way home (even when we were running a little late because of a train ticket mix up on the way). Food was good (except for those disgusting chicken sausage roll things we got for the ""light snack"") and the vegetarian options are a little crap. Seats were comfortable with wings that allowed you to get some shut eye on the full flights. Leg room was ok (but I'm 6'3"") so I'm used to being uncomfortable sitting anywhere. Drinks came around every hour to keep everyone hydrated. The entertainment system was fine staff were pleasant."
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,LAX-NRT-KL-DPS and return. Where did this gem of an airline come from. Usually take JAL or Cathy Pacific - but the ticket price was worth a chance. Unbelievable Satay and meals. Gate staff in NRT were a bit frigid but all others were spot on. FA both male and female were wonderful and took the time to talk with the passengers about themselves. Unfortunately they had to apologise for the seats and knew that they were not the greatest - but at least they were honest. Video movie etc on a par with the other carriers. KL lounge was beautiful - unlike LAX - but the shared lounge in NRT had little to no food - but they went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. Top shelf service based on the value of the ticket. Can hardly wait to fly them again.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,I had 4 flights with Malaysia last month Sydney to Istanbul via KL and return. I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews here but I have to say that I was delighted with everything. The person next to me on the IST - KUL leg left some belongings in the lounge and told the onboard staff who sent someone to retrieve them! Service was excellent and wonderful value for money. I'm not tall and didn't find the angled seats a problem. The only problem on this flight was having to turn off all electronic devices even those in flight mode which was a bit annoying as I only had a Kindle and a tablet to read as something was causing interference in the cockpit.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,KUL-Heathrow. Great airline. The plane was clean and the staff were friendly. There was an excellent choice of films documentary comedy etc. The food was great for airline food even a smoked salmon side salad. I would fly with this company again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,,,3,no,2,KUL-HKG-KUL Economy Class on A380. Full flight both ways. Boarding at KUL was chaotic due to change of departure gate at the very last minute which also resulted in late departure from KUL. Assigned seat was taken by another passenger and was informed by the passenger that the stewardess told her to seat there. Had to wait for almost 10 minutes while the cabin crew rearranging the seating according to the seat number stated on the boarding pass. Meals were good on both sector. IFE crashed 3 times and the supervisor only managed to fix the problem one-hour before touchdown at HKG. Cabin crew were not interested in their job.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,KL - Denpasar - KL using rewards ticket. Both flights on time bags out quickly decent quality food and drink very friendly cabin crew. Very good experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,Travelled COK-KUL-MEL MH129 Oct 2013. The 737-800 on the COK-KUL sector was congested but the 777 on the KUL-MEL sector was okay. Inflight service was perhaps the worst we have encountered. The catering was most noticeable as meals were insufficient and no choice of drinks. Malaysia Airlines is cost cutting even on tea and coffee. I suppose you get what you pay for. Will never travel Malaysia Airlines again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,no,5,LAX-NRT-LAX Economy. I purchased the ticket while they were on special offer the fare was very reasonable. LAR-NRT: Check in staff were not friendly aircraft was old but the seat was comfortable. Entertainment system crashed twice and the sound and screen quality was bad. Inflight service was okay and the food was average. NRT-LAX: Check in very slow. Poor entertainment service and the flight attendant who delivered our meals (dinner and breakfast) was disrespectful. I wouldn't recommend this airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,What an absolutely non-customer service focused Airline. Never again will I fly with Malaysian Airlines. It was the first and last time. Normally I fly with Singapore or Emirates but had seen some reviews saying that Malaysian was good. How wrong could you be. 19 hours delayed bag lost. When I missed our connection due to delays not one person from Malaysian made any effort to help over 20 people also delayed with me. I arrived Terminal 1 Heathrow was told to go to the tranist area in terminal 4 where I was turned away by security. I then had to return to Terminal 1. I then queued for an hour at least before I was told to go landside for assistance. This then took four hours before I was rebooked. I was then given some pittance value food vouchers that were only eligible in a terminal I was not departing from. Then even though the staff had over 9 hours before I departed on my rebooked flight (with Etihad) I was told on departure my bags would not make it. My single stop trip had also been turned into a 2 stop trip which added another 6-8 hours. No help whatsoever when they lost my bag just left at an airport in Australia with no clothes. Pay a little extra and travel with Singapore Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,no,3,Travelled on the new 787 plane LHR to KL and sat in the upper deck seat no: 33H an aisle seat in a row of 2. Was impressed with the cabin which is small (about 10 rows) and has a seat configuration of 2-4-2 unlike the lower deck which has rows of 3-5-3 in economy. Service was very good and food reasonable with frequent snacks on offer. Boarding in this cabin is also smoother than in the lower deck as you board using the same door as business class. Plenty of films/TV shows etc to watch including recent films as well as classics. Absolutely no complaints at all once I was on board. However Malaysian Airlines customer service is the worst I have come across and was so incompetent/rude on the several occasions that I dealt with them that I will never travel with them again. In London before my flight they would not allow me access to my flight details on the internet and refused to reserve me a seat: in Bali I was unable to contact the office either by phone or in person to change the date of my flight to KL and was forced to fly with another airline although I had paid for a flight with Malaysian Airlines and in Kuala Lumpur I spent 5 hours in their office trying to ensure my flight back to the UK would not be cancelled. A woman seating next to me in the main MA office had been there 2 days waiting to speak to a customer service adviser.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Return trip from Brisbane to Bangkok. First time on the 330 on the Brisbane to KL leg. Had read other reviews which were critical of the seating comfort on the 330 but I found the comfort more than acceptable. Cabin crew very attentive and food excellent. Had booked a meal using Chef on Call and was served the meal for breakfast. Flight to BKK was on a 737-800. Was an older plane with no IFE but cabin crew were good. Flight on the return from BKK to KL was on a newer 737-800 with IFE. Only complaint for the return flight to BNE is that was more than 2.5 hours into the flight before I was able to get my first drink and that was after asking for it. After that no problems having wine etc topped up. Food was very good and the Lobster Thermidor was better than that on SQ.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,no,3,In July 2013 my husband and flew to Sri Lanka from Melbourne for a 3 week holiday. The flight was good from Melbourne to Malaysia short turn around then on to Colombo. The return was hoped to go as smoothly but not to be. I have two issues with the airline both about treatment to passengers. Firstly flying from Colombo to Malaysia we were subjected to extremely loud promotional material about the airline for over 30 minutes. It left us with fingers in our ears and quite annoyed as it was very early morning. Many people were clearly discomforted by it and a request by another passenger to turn it down was ignored. That alone would lead me to not fly again. I made the mistake of ordering a vegetarian meal on the flight over and had the most bland and unimaginative food possible. My husband enjoyed his food but noted it was considerably poorer quality on the flight back to Australia. I will avoid this airline from now on and next flight was booked with Singapore Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,We travelled from Hong Kong to Adelaide on 21-22/10/2013 and the leg from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur on the A380 was easily the best flight in 15 years of travelling on Asian airlines that I have encountered. Seating had plenty of leg room (something missing on the A330-300 from Kuala Lumpur to Adelaide) and the cabin service was unbelievably good. The staff actually looked to be enjoying their job. Will certainly be flying Malaysia Airlines again.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,3,SIN-KUL-AKL. I don't think they deserve to be classified as s 5 star airlines I traveled with Thai Airways from Singapore to Auckland and their plane was much newer better food and flight attendants were friendlier. I boarded a very old Boeing 737 from Singapore to KUL with connecting flight from KL to Auckland. The aircraft from Singapore to KL was old with many of the seat arm rests torn off. Some staff were not friendly we were served a dried pastry overcooked and almost inedible and the inflight entertainment took a long time to work after take off. A real disappointment.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,PER-KUL-LHR. After reading the reviews on here I was a bit sceptical about flying but was very pleased. The food was excellent the crew were very efficient and pleasant could not fault any of this. The seat comfort was ok once the optimum position was found. The pillow and duvet were fine considering how much cheaper they are than EK or QR it did not lack in quality in comparison with the ticket price.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,4,LHR-KUL-BNE. Thankfully only one way. Having flown Singapore Airlines Emirates Kingfisher Air Asia Malaysian Airlines were a real disappoint. Most disappointing was the customer service which was badly lacking. Very strict on luggage limits. Poor food service taking a long time after take off to serve no regular checks on passengers for drinks or food and generally unfriendly. Perhaps the cabin crew were having a bad day but given the choice of competitors we won't be flying this airline again.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,no,4,IST to KUL in business October 2013. Flight delayed 7 hours due to technical problem on the ageing 777-200. We were bussed to a nearby hotel but hotel and especially food provided was of low quality. Once we did take off the plane was showing its age although I found seat pitch generous and slept ok on the angled lie flat seat. No champagne before take off and no satay which they brag so much about. The older all male crew were efficient but not warm or attentive. IFE pretty poor compared to BA Emirates etc. Amenity bag small but adequate. Their A380 may be better but overall the experience fell a long way short of market leaders.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,,,3,yes,6,KUL-MEL 6 Oct MH 129. Been travelling Malaysia Airlines regularly over 20 years now have noticed their inflight catering and staff attitude (some of them) is getting worse and rather appalling. They need to start treating all Economy passengers much better. Recent flights got served a snack from / to Australia flights. Dried pastry overcooked and almost inedible lucky to get a second drink if you needed one. Very disappointing. They could take a tip from Air Asia Staff.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,KCH-KUL-HKG-YVR. MH2597 (KCH-KUL) overnight in KL then MH072 (KUL-HKG) before transferring to CX 838 (HKG-YVR). The planes used on both MH sectors were pretty new with a 737-800 and A380-800 used on the first and second sector respectively. Both flights left on time and the flights were smooth with no problems encountered. The 737-800 interiors were brand new and comfortable enough for a 90 minute flight. Cabin crew were efficient and friendly. The A380 interiors were showing a bit of wear and tear some of the carpets in the high-traffic areas near the washrooms were a bit worn out. Cabin crew on this flight were also efficient and worked well as a team. A relatively short flight (just under 4 hours) so didn't bother with the entertainment system. Seating on both flights were comfortable enough and the food was hot and tasty but nothing special. Would be nice if they brought pineapple juice back like they used to have about 15 years ago. The orange and apple juice options are getting a bit boring.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,9/10/2013. BKK-KUL. On their new B737-800. Love the interior design. Sky-interior and leather seat. Good legroom for 2 hours flight. Staff service was amazing. Full of smile friendly and cheerful. Food not much to say. Just delicious. Inflight entertainment provided on this route. Highly recommended.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,4,no,6,MEL-KUL in business. Disappointing flight with very little attention from crew who had the annoying habit of talking to you with their heads turned away. It meant that they had to begrudgingly repeat what they'd said much to the frustration of all. How they won worlds best cabin crew is inconceivable. Angled lie flat seat comfort ok. Drinks haphazard. Pillows a joke - so thin you'd get more support using the blanket. Meals surprising - a feta cheese pie and orange juice for dinner! More in keeping with a budget carrier.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,AMS-KUL-MEL. A pleasant flight operated by a B777 on the AMS-KUL sector (MH17). The flight attendants in business class were impressive: well-organised and very responsive. Plenty of room between the seats. On the other hand the KUL-MEL sector (MH129) was operated by an A330 with the seats being smaller and the pitch noticeably tighter. Very prompt service of the sandwich refreshment shortly after take off much appreciated by those (probably the majority) who had transferred from in-bound flights and who were anxious to relax. Service of the main meal before arriving in MEL was significantly slower!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,KUL-HKG-KUL in economy. A squeaky-clean A380. Boarding orderly departures on time; arrivals ahead of schedule. Good newspaper selection. Comfortable seats. Food much nicer than on B737s that MAS flies regionally. Crew very pleasant attentive chatty generous with drinks fluent in English/Malay/Mandarin. Haagen-Dazs ice cream was served. Overall a great flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Below average airline for the price they charge. The much cheaper Air Asia was better in service. Some seats wouldn't push back absolutely no in-flight entertainment (in KUL-HYD sector) and average food. Had a bad experience with the staff not wanting to check-in a hand baggage at the gate a request that most airlines would accommodate.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,Heathrow-Kuala Lumpur-Sydney. After boarding at Heathrow the entire A380 stayed on the tarmac for 4 hours due to a failure to lodge the flight authorisation form with Heathrow. This delay means that after a 13hr flight to KL we missed our connecting to Sydney. No one on the plane was able to assist passengers that needed connecting flight and upon arrival at KL no one helped with the transfer counter either. Ground staff were incredibly rude unhelpful and tried to refuse us food vouchers. They simply handed us a computer printout and told us to go to Cathy Pacific counter for a boarding pass. Turns out they stuck us on a flight from KL to Hong Kong then to Sydney. That flight was full and we were sent back to line up again with Malaysia Airlines. This happened twice more and it was 4 hours standing at the transfer counter before we were put on a flight to Singapore then Sydney. When we arrived in Sydney 12 hours later than the original flight our checked in bags were missing. Turns out our bags were still in KL. No apology.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,SIN-KUL-BKK-KUL-SIN. All 4 flights on fairly new 737-800's I pre booked seats 5F and 5A on all flights checked in at SIN very late only 40 min before departure but the great staff and the ever efficient Changi Airport made this a non issue. SIN-KUL flight only around 50 min with a snack served I used the Malaysian lounge in KL and it is very comfortable the food served was of good standard too. Flight to BKK around 2hrs with a meal served arrived on time. Return check in quick used the Thai lounge in satellite E which is fine once again flight to KUL lasted just over 2 hours a choice of meals which were good quality; back in KUL had around 1 hour before connecting back to SIN a great trip enjoyed the service on new aircraft look forward to using MH again.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,SYD-KUL-LHR in Business class. SYD-KUL on new A330-300. Very friendly check-in with fast-track through immigration and security. Used Qantas First Lounge as a OneWorld Emerald member which was just fantastic. Priority boarding provided and was in an organised fashion. No alcoholic beverages for pre-departure drinks. Flight departed on time. Seat was comfortable in the sitting and recline positions but are angled flat. This was not a problem as it was a day flight. IFE was AVOD but a little limited on latest releases. On-board catering was disappointing on this flight. Cabin crew friendly courteous and helpful. Flight arrived early into KUL. Lounge in KUL was reasonably good but the catering was disappointing. Shower facilities are getting tired but they did the job. KUL- LHR on A380. No priority screening or boarding for this flight. Again no alcoholic beverages prior to departure. Flight departed a little early. Seat was very comfortable in the sitting position and turns into a flat-bed which was also very comfortable and allowed me to get almost 7 hours sleep on the 12.5 hour flight. The kink in the leg- rest part of the seat which was previously a bit of a problem appears to have been fixed and straightened. The lavatories on these planes a very spacious. IFE much better on this flight with a lot more latest releases. Catering overall was also disappointing on this flight except for the excellent satay. The cabin crew on this flight were fantastic and it made the whole experience a pleasure. We arrived a little early. This was not my final destination but priority baggage was quickly delivered. A solid business class product overall but catering needs to improve. Excellent value for money.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew Business from London to Perth and thought the overall experience was good. The seats were better than I expected after reading this forum and the service staff on my flight were all polite and helpful. Food was excellent. The only main negative point was that the inflight entertainment was rubbish compared to what you get on other airlines. A real disappointment especially when flying long haul.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,4,Melbourne to Delhi on Oct 1 and while MEL-KUL leg was okay - even though we were woken up a few hours before arrival into KL and offered a breakfast of rice and prawn (the option was frittata had run out). The second KUL- DEL was the worst flight I have been on. We were sitting in a 737 which had only 2 toilets for the 120+ passengers flight felt like a domestic short haul flight but ended up being a torturous long haul. I understand that there was a delay due to unforeseen circumstances. The crew were far too young and far too involved in their own chatter at the back of the plane people had to go up to ask for water and biscuits. Flight was bumpy so the seatbelt light was on and no tea or coffee could be served. I asked for Sprite and it had run out. When the seatbelt sign went off we had to ring the call bell to ask for tea and coffee. It was a very unpleasant experience - and one that has me convinced that something has gone downhill in this supposedly five star airline it was the first time I had flown Malaysia and there won't be a second. I had tried to web check in exactly 48 hours before on my return and found most seats blocked.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,KUL-ADL MEL-KUL Business class. MAS Adelaide check-in for return trip failed to provide the fast-track immigration pass needed in Melbourne and was rudely ejected from fast-track queue despite showing business class boarding pass. Queued over 30mins in slow lane. Seats when fully reclined are very uncomfortable. On return flight only one particularly rude FA insisted that small bag in foot well be stowed for takeoff and landing. Never seen this before. MAS impossible to get hold of by phone despite promised callback service.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew First Class KL to LHR on the A380. Aircraft was new and only 8 seats in First Class so felt like a rock star. Seat was fantastic and huge TV screen. IFE was fantastic. Flight attendants great - very friendly and attentive but not overly familiar. Food and beverage was business class standard - limited choices of wines (FAs couldn't really explain about the wines other than red or white) food choices were not what I would have expected from first class. Overall first class cabin with business class service.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,Flew business class from Sydney to KL. Aircraft was new and very clean check in was smooth FAs were friendly and attentive and well above average. Meals were good though not great wine selection OK. IFE was great.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,My wife and I flew Business Class Perth to Kuala Lumpur A330 then A380 to London 2nd July 2013 then back to Perth by the reverse route 28th September 2013. 10 out of 10 to MAS because all 4 flights were excellent. We were so well looked after by the very friendly and efficient cabin crew who could not have done more to make our journey as pleasant as possible. As a retired Airline Captain I have travelled the world for many years and I can thoroughly recommend MAS.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,Flew KUL-MEL on their new A330. Nice and modern cabin. Good selection of inflight entertainment except for the annoying ads at the start of every movie/show. However the cabin crew were appalling! They seemed uninterested and made their passengers felt like they are a burden.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,3,Travelled from Bangalore to Singapore and Singapore to Delhi last week (both ways stopped at KL). I must say that quality has gone down very much compared to 2008-9. The staff is not at all caring. The food was very oily. The staff is more concerned about finishing their tasks and are not really concerned about customer. Empathy is totally missing.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,BNE-KUL-LHR on 18/9/2013. BNE to KUL on an A320. KUL to LHR on A380. Flights were on time or earlier. Crew on both flights were excellent. We have flown this route frequently with MAS and have found their service and comfort good. Food was excellent on both flights. Lounge at KUL is getting a bit tired in the area of the showers but does the job.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,1,no,4,Flew Adelaide to London and back again in Aug/Sep 2013 business class. The A330 from Adelaide to KL has to be the most uncomfortable seating experience I have ever had and as far as converting into a bed and getting any sleep that is quite impossible. The A380 KL to London is comfortable but Malaysia Airlines has chosen the most basic of fit outs and this shows (I flew Emirates recently on the A380 in business class so can make a direct comparison). As always staff polite and helpful and food good but the planes let the airline down badly. Will not be using them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew SYD to MLE via KL. SYD-KL was in A330-300 then 737-800 to Male. Airbus had very comfy seats good food and service and very good individual inflight entertainment. 737 had typically uncomfortable seats fairly good food but had a few small flat screens for all to watch. Terrible movie featured. Downloaded some movies on the IPhone for the return trip so I didn't have to endure that again. Price was good though. Had a 15 hour layover in KL the way there and 2.5hrs the way back. Was really happy with the 15 hours visit to KL and had a fantastic time shopping and sightseeing there. Got a beautiful hotel room for $100 US which gave us two 2-hour sleeps to refresh us. Service good on all legs. Very hard to sleep through the night in Economy seats. Would happily fly MAS again but would likely prioritise AirAsia as you can get a Flatbed in Premium class for the same fare as Economy in MAS and most other full-service airlines.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,no,3,SYD-KUL-LHR return. Malaysia aren't that bad - they are just not as good as the competition. The A380 leg between KL and Heathrow is ok if not as good as rivals but the Business class seats on offer between KL and Australia are extremely poor. The Service is friendly and efficient but every flight I have taken with them has ether had problems with lavatories broken seats (other passengers) or problems of one sort or another. Also on a two hour delay with connecting flights to London there was no info provided about if the connecting flight was being held or not. Now that Qantas had upgraded it's offerings Malaysian is definitely the poor cousin if flying between Australia and Europe.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,LHR-PEN via KUL and return. A380 is a super quiet plane. Sat on upper deck at the rear of the plane. On the way out the crew were excellent. On return not quite as outstanding. The food and beverages were ok although lacking on return trip. Seat fairly comfortable. Brilliant to be able to watch the take off and landing from camera positioned on tail of the aircraft. Over all quite comfortable with adequate leg room. I would fly MAS again. It was nice to see the mood lighting enjoyed by Business class passengers gradually getting brighter but in economy they whacked up the bright white lighting which was not very pleasant. I can't understand why this feature is not available throughout the cabins especially on such a new aircraft.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,no,3,SYD-KUL-LHR return. Malaysia aren't that bad - they are just not as good as the competition. The A380 leg between KL and Heathrow is ok if not as good as rivals but the Business class seats on offer between KL and Australia are extremely poor. The Service is friendly and efficient but every flight I have taken with them has ether had problems with lavatories broken seats (other passengers) or problems of one sort or another. Also on a two hour delay with connecting flights to London there was no info provided about if the connecting flight was being held or not. Now that Qantas had upgraded it's offerings Malaysian is definitely the poor cousin if flying between Australia and Europe.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,LHR-KUL-HKG in Business Class. Two wonderful flights with great customer service. The business class seats in the A380 (LHR-KUL) are spacious and comfortable. MH offers a nice variety of meal selections. The food was tasty. The second flight was on an B737-800. I was in first row. The seats are comfortable and the food was also tasty. The crew on this flight was fantastic.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,KUL-CDG on A380. The aircraft is nice and entertainment system was sufficient for the long flight. But the crews were terrible. Poor services throughout the flight not attentive to the needs of passengers and when requesting anything seemed reluctant to provide anything. No smiles from the crew. Definitely not a 5 star airlines with this kind of poor service.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,7,"Our family flew from Australia to Malaysia and took several short hops up and down to Singapore on MAS before flying back to Australia. The cabin crew invariably made us feel welcome with our young children and were extremely helpful all along the way. Mostly new B 737-800s and A 330-300s with decent inflight entertainment options too. But the standard of catering on the long haul sector has dropped dramatically over the years. On the outbound overnight flight we were offered a disappointing mushroom or chicken roll for supper and the same dish appeared as ""breakfast"" on the flight back. There may be some savings to be had in cutting back catering but I think MAS has gone too far when compared to the competition."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,5,Finished 5 domestic sectors with MAS over the last two months (KUL-SDK-KUL SBW-KUL-SBW-KUL) on old B734 and new B738 MAS is certainly not a 5-star airline anymore. Having flown with so many other airlines in the past their services were not better than most of them. The male cabin crew were mostly rude and unhelpful. Was this what you should expect from an airline who once claimed to have 'World Best Cabin Crew'. They are an OK airline but definitely not a 5-star airline.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,We have just completed the first leg of our holiday travelling on the A330-300 aircraft from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur then the A380 to Paris. We sat in the second row. I had read previous reviews which had criticised the seat comfort of the A330 so it was with some trepidation that I felt how firm the seat was. However my fears proved to be unfounded. The seat is able to be adjusted in multiple ways. The staff on this leg were outstanding. The second leg was in the A380 we had booked seats in the smaller front business section and these were very comfortable. We both were able to get a number of hours sleep. Again the staff were friendly and helpful. The only negative was my meal on this flight which was overcooked. We are sure our return journey will also be enjoyable.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,3,no,5,Flew MEL to BKK with a 2 month old A330 and a new 737. The standout was the new aircraft. The A330 was so comfortable modern and beautiful! The seats were extremely comfortable for economy. However everything else was pretty poor most of all the cabin crew. They were horrific! I never thought that cabin crew could be so rude to the point that it made passengers feel uncomfortable. The only reason I would fly with this airline is because of the new aircraft and its beautiful hub (KUL) is always a pleasure to transit through. Everything else was atrocious! If you want service do not fly MAS!
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Flight from Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne 8/9/13. Plane a little dated but I can cope with this bad service however is a different story. Just after meals were served I got quite a bad blood nose after which I fainted. My traveling companion recognised the need for me to lay flat and recoup. He quickly took our untouched meals to the stone faced stewardess to enable me to lay flat and asked for assistance she showed no concern for me whatsoever. When asked for some extra tissues she threw a couple of handtowels my way. We complained to the head steward who apologised and offered us our meals back which we declined. Having flown over with British Airways who were professional on every level it was very clear to me that there was an enormous difference between these similarly fared airlines. I will never fly Malaysian Airlines again.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,4,PER-KUL-BOM in Economy Class on September 13th. PER-KUL was on an A330-300 and KUL-BOM on the super congested 737-800. The only meal served on the PER-KUL leg was breakfast at 5am (choice of quiche with sausage or rice with shrimp sambal) since the flight had taken off at 1.30am. Perhaps it was automatically assumed that people would've had a nice heavy dinner before boarding the plane. Whilst the food served on the KUL-BOM leg was good (Roti and chicken curry) it was a bit disappointing to know that none of the FA's spoke Hindi which pretty much made it very hard for a few passengers who could not speak or understand English. Overall I think MH's quality seems to have dropped a bit.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,13 September. BKK-KUL-LHR on 737-800 and A380. Return trip was considerable better. I sat at 1A on the 737 and although the food was bland the cabin crew managed to top up my glass several times. The KUL lounge was full and seemed relatively pointless given that there were more comfortable seats outside. It was hard to get a drink. After finally getting onto the A380 we had to wait an hour after some confusion over the cargo which meant we missed our slot. The pre-ordered food was great and I had finally worked out that the flat-bed seat of most comfortable when it not quite flat. One of the stewards told me they had recently been modified but was not quite sure how. I managed several hours sleep and awoke to a pleasant breakfast. The cabin crew were polite and efficient; the aircraft was spotless and the toilets big enough for a small party were kept spotless. A far more positive experience than the outward journey.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,7,This airline really should be downgraded from it's current 5 star ranking. I flew them all over Asia out of their KL hub for several weeks. I was shocked to receive an e-mail from them notifying me of a major schedule change and cancellation of one leg from my trip just a few days before leaving! Customer service was mediocre over the phone. No compensation given for this huge hassle which caused a very long layover at KLIA. Food was offered even on short flights but it did not taste very good and wasn't presented well. The service onboard was pretty good and attendants were generally very helpful. Malaysia Airlines is better than most U.S. carriers but it is not in the same league as Singapore Airlines or ANA. I had very high expectations and I was let down.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,LAX-KUL-HKT round trip. B777 from LAX was great service food and AVOD. Seats are angle flat and first generation. Bit narrow but comfortable enough for 5 hours sleep on long transpacific legs. B737 service to Phuket was also very good and no problems with crew or plane.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,4,no,4,"KUL-ADL 8th September. Morning departure from ADL. Check-in was efficient and well handled by ground staff. Boarding was very well managed by ground staff in Adelaide. Once on board the plane things were different. Cabin crew were just plain disinterested had poor English skills and again there was minimal interaction. Tray tables were dirty video screen was smudged and talk about a sticky in flight magazine pages were stuck together! The food was mediocre this time and before landing a flight attendant went around barking ""seat belts seat belts""! This is a 5 star airline? I think not."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,no,4,Flew from Sydney to London and back 4/9/13 - 9/9/13. A330 and A380. Have to say disappointed in comparison to Emirates and Singapore. Seats seemed small even on A380. Biggest gripe was that it was freezing - on all legs. I did ask why it was so cold and was told I could have an extra blanket. Staff were ok nothing remarkable. No eye shades and I was so sore because of the seats. Entertainment was average. Food ok. It was alright but I'll never book with them again as it was too cold and uncomfortable.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Flew business class Istanbul-Kuala Lumpur in an aged Boeing 777. The seats are not lay flat but angled very hard for me to get any sleep. Service and menu was disappointing. This airline needs to move with the times on long haul the competition is doing a much better job and offering a better product.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,3,LHR-KUL A380. Great check in given exit row seats for long legs. Customer service was non existent like we were an inconvenience. Prodded my wife in the shoulder to get her to put her seat upright. Very little verbal anything and bad English when used. For a flight with 90% westerners I would have expected better. KUL-Phuket on Boeing 737 a shocker. Cabin was filthy spent half the flight planning how I would clean it. Will never fly with this carrier again.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,3,yes,2,7 September. LHR-KUL-BKK on A380 and 737-800. Having flown on a Singapore Airlines A380 on several occasions I was keen to see whether the experience with Malaysia was comparable. I had managed to get a seat in the smaller front cabin. Check-in was efficient. The LHR lounge was pleasant with good service champagne on tap and a great view. Boarding was smooth with a priority line for business passengers. I was fortunate in having an empty seat next to me. The cabin crew were efficient and pleasant. I had pre-ordered my food with Chef-on-Call and the quality was excellent. There were however three problems. The A380 seat although flatbed was simply not comfortable - it seemed as it was raised in the middle slightly and it was not easy to sleep on. Secondly having reserved a seat at the front of business on the 737 I was moved to the back with no explanation given. And thirdly they failed to transfer my bag at KUL and it would be following on a later flight. I will need a lot of convincing to book with Malaysia Airways again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Jakarta (CGK) to Amsterdam (AMS) via Kuala Lumpur (KUL). It was a long flight. The flight attendants were really nice friendly and helpful. They served delicious food. I really enjoyed the flight. MH offers great in-flight entertainment with plenty of films music and TV channels.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,3,So we're a couple travelling Brisbane to London via Kuala Lumpur currently seated in the Air Malaysia lounge in KL. The first leg is complete and failed to impress. Not only did the breakfast egg option run out before seat row 6 but the coffee was horrendous and twice had sugar added when it was specifically not requested. Although I am trying to be optimistic about the upcoming 13hr leg we have just confirmed that the attendant that checked us in 11hrs ago put us across the aisle from one another! Perfect considering my fiancé is a nervous flyer.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,6,I travel with them at least once a month either in Business or Economy class. Their inflight service attitude is normally above standard and while airline meals are what they are MH catering is tasty and ok for regional flights. What I want to comment on is the appearance of the cabin: on many recent flights I took within the region especially on B737s the cleanliness left a lot to be desired. Any aircraft I boarded had either dirty finger or palm-prints on the overhead lockers. The way they looked it appeared to be from aircraft mechanics as they were oil/grease based prints. Nobody bothered to clean them up. Additionally the aircon vents and even overhead monitors that drop down from the ceilings on B737s all had a huge accumulation of fluff attached to them. It all gives the interior of the planes a shabby look and not representative of a 5 star airline. What prompted me to write this review was a recent domestic flight on Vietnam Airlines where the planes were spotlessly clean and looked all new even when they were not. Malaysia Airlines get it together and clean your planes properly. It is a disgrace for a 5 star airline to be so careless about hygiene.
