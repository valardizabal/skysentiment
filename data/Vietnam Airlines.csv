✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Ho Chi Minh City to Sydney,August 2024,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,9," Was flying with Vietnam Airlines from SGN to SYD on Premium Economy. Flight was on time with good ground services offered by amazing staff who assisted us to see a doctor since one of us was not feeling well. Cabin crew staff who was in charge of Premium Economy was extremely thoughtful and attentive. F&B was amazing, 10/10 for both meals. Inflight entertainment was good as Vietnam Airlines has just recently updated their movie list. Seat was comfortable, though mine could not recline due to a technical issue."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Frankfurt,June 2024,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,2.0,2,no,3,"  The Vietnam Airlines international flights from Australia (Sydney to Frankfurt and return) receives an above average 3.5 out of 5 star from me for the on-board flight experience which is OK for what is still a budget airline however if you think that you may need to possibly make changes to your booking then I have to really insist (in order to keep your sanity) that you proceed with another airline. I had made numerous, yes numerous, frustrating (for me) calls and emails to change flight details mostly without success. Put simply Vietnam Airlines will not make any changes on the phone without an email whereby they do no respond back to you on then you have to get on the phone again (waiting for up to 90 minutes) and start the process over and over again. I even approached the customer service counter at Ho Chi Minh airport for a simple change which took approximately 30 minutes."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh city,July 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,yes,10,  Good service. The flight was comfortable and delight. Both ground and cabin staff are considerate and thoughtful. Signed luggage is easy to get. VIP lounge is cool and has good food.
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Phu Quoc via Ho Chi Minh / Hanoi,July 2024,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3,no,5,"   My experience was just okay with them. International flight is good and provides a lot of amenities along with water bottle, cushion, blanket, earphones, good legroom space, food, etc. my only point of concern and dissatisfaction is that they don't mention what is the ingredient in their Vegetarian and Non-Veg meal. For Hindu Meal, they give non-veg in this which is uncertain for sure. Also, there was a delay in flight and for their short domestic flights in Vietnam, they don't provide meals. Once I landed back to Delhi my luggage was delayed for almost an hour. Overall experience with them was just okay and not so good but it can be better."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phnom Penh to Hanoi,June 2024,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I suppose to travel on june 10th to June 15th 2024 with my families of 4. Vietnam air had cancelled our flight without let us know on June 15th go back to Phnom Penh Cambodia. Because we didn’t used the flights on June the 10th On June 15th we were arrive to Hanoi airport , the Vietnam air customer service said we don’t have flight to come back to Phnom Penh because they canceled, I had asked how did you communicate with third party or travelers they have no an answer to me, even we asked to check if any a different times or day we can travel or refund money they said no, nothing they can help. These are at Vietnam customers service in Hanoi airport. We lost $1226.64 for whole trips and then we have to buy another flight to go back To Phnom Penh another $1200.00 total of $2300.00. We travel a lot in USA and Asia but never ever had very bad experiences plus huge lost, if anyone want to consider to fly with Vietnam Air I would not recommend at all. They didn’t seem really care about travelers, no friendly, doesn’t want to talked to us."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Phnom Penh to San Francisco via Hi Chi Minh City,June 2024,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Vietnam Airlines confirmed both of the flight legs (Phnom Penh to Saigon to San Francisco) were able to take a pet as AVIH by email. I reserved early and followed all requirements. Then Vietnam Airlines changed the aircraft the day of the flight and did not inform me. I arrived early, but was made to wait for checking in. Then less than one hour before take off, the representative informed me that the cat could only fly as checked luggage, and he would not assist in making any changes for this possibility. I missed both flights due to their error, poor communication, and terrible customer service. Please save you and your pet the stress. Avoid Vietnam Airlines!"
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to Hong Kong,May 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,5.0,4,yes,9,"  Positive Experience on Vietnam Airlines (VN592): Friendly and Attentive Staff: Both the check-in and cabin crew on VN592 were very attentive and ensured a smooth travel experience. Comfortable Economy Class: Despite being a shorter flight (around two hours), economy class passengers were served a proper lunch, exceeding expectations for a regional route. Pleasant Return Flight (VN593): Smooth Journey: The return flight from Hong Kong to Hanoi (VN593) was smooth and enjoyable."

Lotusmiles benefits were improved, revamped with less requirements on miles. Cabin crew really cared about passenger preferences and needs. Well done to Vietnam Airlines!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to Da Nang,May 2024,4.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,9,  I found Vietnam Airlines to be excellent in every respect. The ground staff and aircraft crew were professional and courteous. The flights (I flew round trip) were on time. Because of my height the flight attendant found me a better seat on one of the flights. A real human being responded to my questions via email and a prompt and courteous manner.
Not Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Paris CDG to Perth via Ho Chi Minh City,March 2024,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,5,no,1," Just wanted to share my experience with Vietnam Airlines. Flight was due to leave Paris Charles De Gaulle on friday at around 13:30, arrived at the airport around 10:00. There was a delay on the flight due to technical difficulties. Around 17:00 we got news that the technical issues would not be fixed and that the flight was postponed to saturday and we had to be present ourselves the next day at the check-in counter at 9:30. We received a hotel voucher, but did not receive our luggage back. The next day I was present at 9:30 for check-in, and there was an endless line of people there (only 3 check-in counters were opened for the delayed flight), luckily I had a business class ticket and could skip the line. I specifically asked if everything was allright for the connecting flight in Ho Chi Minh and the lady behind the counter called Vietnam Airlines and they said ""yes everything is allright put him on the plane we will hand over his boarding ticket for the flight to Perth in Ho Chi Minh City"". So I boarded the plane, thinking everything was going to go smoothly from there on. But when I arrived at Ho Chi Minh City I had to go the transfer desk, alongside 100 other people who had a connecting flight... Apparently they had done nothing for any of the passenger’s with connecting flights, and only 3 counters were open for taking care of all those urgent problems. Many people were stranded there (for the second day in a row), but since they assured me my flight was ok and my flight was only 9hrs later, I waited till all the urgent matters were attended to. Once 80% of the people were helped (or not) I asked how about my ticket to Perth, and then got the bad news, the flight of today was cancelled sir, we will give you a hotel voucher and you can catch the flight of tomorrow (32 hours later)... By this point I was boiling inside. I asked if there were no other flights they could arrange for me and they said no, we can give you a flight to Sydney or Brisbane instead of Perth (the other side of Australia...), but I politely declined. I went to the woman from Vietnam Airlines responsible for the transfer desk and asked if I could book another flight and if I could get my luggage. She said yes no problem, if you want to book another flight that's all right for us. I only arrived in Perth 2 days later, so 2 hotel nights I had prebooked were also lost in the meantime. On the way back to Paris I got told that since I did not cancel my flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Perth and I was in their system as a NO SHOW, they voided (cancelled) my tickets back from Perth to Paris! I told him that his colleague in Ho Chi Minh assured me that I could book another flight and that everything was all right. But after loosing my cool and shouting and cursing around for fifteen minutes, the responsible said there was nothing he could do for me and that I had to contact my sales agent 2 days later to see if there was anything he could do for me. Horrible service, how they did nothing for all those passengers stranded in Ho Chi Minh. They cancelled the flight on friday around 17:00, and we landed in Ho Chi Minh 32 hours later than that. They could have looked into everything up front so that people would have their tickets ready when they landed in Ho Chi Minh instead of leaving it up to 3 people behind the counter that were doing all they could to fix the problem at hand instantaneously. And then not giving me a ticket home while there was room on the planes!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi,April 2024,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Flights are good value for money. The check in was so easy, on board flight cabin crews and their leaders were was excellent and his team members were very caring. They speaks both English and Vietnamese and were so supportive. The on board food was excellent, fresh and lovely.  Love to travel again with this airlines. Highly recommend them. On board team is excellent."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Taipei via Ho Chi Minh City,March 2024,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,4.0,4,yes,5,"  The video system was working poorly for the entire right side of the plane if not the whole plane (I couldn't see) was not working properly. Over 12 hours I managed to watch one movie I had seen before with a lot of interruptions in quality ie suddenly stop. Various people complained and were moved to other seats but it seems to not have made a difference. The flight attendants were running up and down trying to sort this out for various people who spoke up while also trying to serve meals. This is not their fault and re-setting a few times did nothing. The meals were good, the Asian one more strongly spiced and not bland. They served a meal about an hour into boarding about 2.30 pm Paris time. Then later at unknown time a breakfast. It seemed that instant noodles were available at all times. Arrived on time. Smooth transition to departures although I had an 8 hour wait till my connection. If only the video was working."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to Paris,March 2024,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4,yes,9,"  I flew Paris to Hanoi in February 2024. We have spent 6 weeks traveling in Vietnam all trips with Vietnam airlines. I was impressed by the seating room and comfortable seats. But most importantly was the professionalism of all staff from ground to air. More than 8 trips never had one small issue, congratulations to all Vietnam airlines staff. The food served was also good quality. I will be traveling soon with Vietnam Airlines."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Seoul via Hanoi,April 2023,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,9,"  My first time trying this airline, it was red eye flight with a short transit time (1hr 10mins). I decided to go with this due to low fare at that time. The crews were lovely and helpful, they served hot meal even for the short part of KL to Hanoi and again Hanoi to Seoul. The landing and take off was extremely smooth to the point that i did not even realized we have touched the ground. There was no entertainment from KL to Hanoi as the plane was a little dated but with comfortable seats but the flight from Hanoi to Seoul was even better. The plane was brand new with good entertainment selection, it was a comfortable flight. Even with my returning flight Seoul - HCM - KL, it was as good as the one I went to Seoul. I am impressed with the services as they often offered drinks and snacks to us. Even with short transit time for both my trip (going and returning) the airport staff was accommodating and help us navigate quickly to the transit area by giving us some priorities. It would be better to have the new plane for the KL - Vietnam part but overall is still good."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh City.,March 2024,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,4.0,3,yes,7,"  Flight was just over an hour, so was difficult to get a lot wrong. Good leg room, served a sandwich and non alcoholic drink. I would have expected a jet bridge given it was an international flight and the cost of the ticket, but it was on a remote stand upon arrival in Ho Chi Minh City."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh to Singapore,March 2024,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,2,"  I booked to travel to Phu Quoc and 2 months after booking a preferred time, they start changing my departure time from 1 hour delayed to 7 hours delayed 3 days before travel date. Their explanation was that due to operation. I've tried contacting the airline with roaming charges while in Vietnam to ask for an earlier flight as I'm traveling with seniors and kids as well to visit the resort. They said they only have spots for 3 people for the earlier flight. I booked a 2pm flight and their available flight was 130pm. So they've decided to push my flight to a 9pm flight. I purposely didn't book a budget airline in Vietnam because of my worries of delays and issues with transfer while traveling with seniors and kids. All in all, I ended up canceling with a cancelation fee as well because they only waive cancelation fee if they change your flight for more then 12 hours 1 leg. Be careful when you book anything with Vietnam Airlines. I flew with them to Singapore and that flight had no entertainment and the food was horrid. Flight attendant spoke English fine at least. Seems to me they don't know how to sell tickets and open more routes if it's booked. Instead they book different times and push whoever not lucky."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Mumbai to Ho Chi Minh,February 2024,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1,no,4, The Business Class seats are amongst the worst I have sat it in. They recline about four inches and the arm rests are made of hard material Very uncomfortable for a five hour flight. The pricing was about 7-times economy fare which is very over priced because the only real additional value is priority check in and wider seats (2-2 instead of 3-3). Lounge at Ho Chi Minh airport was ok and the inflight service was pleasant enough although they don’t seem to understand English at all. The entertainment system also (on your mobile through WiFi) didn’t appear to have any English options. Unfortunately there don’t appear to be many other options for Mumbai-Saigon. A pity because I loved every part of my recent golf trip to Saigon and would go more often if the flight was more convenient & comfortable.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,DaNang to Jakarta via Ho Chi Minh City ,February 2024,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4,yes,8,"  It has comfortable and spacious seats, with halal certified food (Muslims don't need to worry or request for the special meals) that tastes good. The entertainment needs personal earphones and gadget to connect to the WiFi."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-9,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Hanoi to London Heathrow,February 2024,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,"  We flew from Siem Reap to Hanoi then on to Heathrow and had originally booked into economy class. As it was a night flight we decided that when we got to Hanoi we decided to upgrade to business which was done at a discounted rate. The staff at Hanoi once confirming that seats were available we were escorted through the airport getting to the head of many channels to ensure we got onto our flight. We then had under 2 hours to enjoy the benefits of the lounge. The lounge was acceptable with a decent choice of food and beverages but it could do with a noodle bar and a bar but as it was late, just after midnight this wasn't an issue as I wasn't in the mood for indulgence. Qatar Doha lounge and ANA's lounge at Haneda are better. Once seated on the 'plane the attentive FA presents you with a choice of drinks including a very nice champagne. They continued to be attentive throughout the flight and cannot be faulted. The flight itself was largely comfortable except for the 'join' between the backrest and the seat once converted into a bed. The topper helped but didn't remove the discomfort on my hip, I'm side sleeper. This forced me to sleep lower but this forced my feet into the narrow space. Once asleep this no longer became an issue and I slept better than in Qatar's QSuite. Food choice seemed very good but as said earlier I wasn't into food much at that time and only had a starter for my meal which was delicious. There seemed to be a glitch with my screen, I was in seat 7D, as every now and then the film would shoot straight to the credits and the screen wasn't very touch sensitive. When I mentioned this to the FA she did offer the option to change seats but I was settled and next to my wife so I declined. My wife had no such problems. However, the selection wasn't that great with few recent releases. This was the same for the music choice. Again, for the time of day not a major problem as I preferred to sleep but if I was travelling during daytime I would have been disappointed."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Hue via Hanoi,February 2024,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,4.0,4,yes,8,"  Bangkok via Hanoi to Hue in Vietnam February 2024. A321 aircrafts, both on time. Due to Lunar New Year, the flights were full, only business class had some seats left. Interline desk in BKK refused to issue my BP earlier than 3 hours early for departure. This issue did fortunately not bother the Skyteam lounge who accepted me with pleasure based on my ticket and status. The lounge is improving, now with champagne and a good, varied buffet. Could improve with a bar, a noodle station, and longer opening hours. My arriving luggage was delayed and had not yet arrived in BKK from my previous flights. As it was already checked in to Vietnam, the airline took fully charge to retrieve it for me. However, I had to depart BKK without my suitcase onboard. I made a PIR report in Hanoi and VN traced it for me in the following hours. They could transfer it to me a day later, as they had to wait for it to arrive in BKK first. They succeeded well, informed me well, and a day upon arrival in Hue it was delivered effectively and free of charges to my residence by motorcycle. Both flights had ten passengers of 16 seats available in business class. Seats were huge and comfortable. New Year dragon decorations in the aircrafts and in the Lotus lounge in Hanoi was a nice touch, well timed and well done. Welcome drinks (incl.champagne) on the 1st leg. Onboard, I was pampered well by the kind, respectful, and proactive staff: champagne, wine, four kind of beers and hot meals with three options. New type of icecoffe served as a new signature drink, “cloud coffee”. The FAs encouraged me to try out everything catered. They were proud to show me that VN business class catering has now improved significantly on this regional flights. Two FAs were assigned for business class alone; they were extremely attentive, polite, proactive, informative, fast, appeared very pleased, and were and truly pampering for each individual. I was addressed as Sir throughout. No individual IFE and no WiFi for these short flights. The domestic Lotus Lounge is huge and delivers a lot; it is a good asset for the airline. The domestic leg was fine as well - surprised to see that now also hot food/snacks are offered. I had pork satays with noodles and salad. In Hue airbridge debarking was pleasant. The luggage issue arisen from previous flights was handled well by VN, who traced it and delivered it at my doorstep the following morning."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787 & A350,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Paris via Ho Chi Minh,December 2023,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,5,yes,7," Thank you to wonderful crew on all flights to Paris and return to Perth. Your service was very good indeed as was most the food on offer. My wife did not like some but I did and kids thought ok too. Your inflight entertainment needs a bit of updating but in saying that there was enough, maybe add some more western movies and TV Your online booking service and app is not the best in the world. When I log in to my account I still have to re-enter booking reference and add my email. This is annoying as I already logged in so should be there anyway. It is not an easy system to use and can only guess older generation would struggle big time. Your counterparts such as Emirates and Qatar and Qantas have much more user friendly system. Price for families tickets were awesome. I will use you again and thanks again to you VA. "
Not Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Paris to Melbourne,August 2023,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,1.0,4,no,6,"  My wife and I flew Vietnam Airlines Business from Paris to Melbourne in August 2023. We were overall very pleased with the standard of the aircraft and level of service. It was not Singapore quality but quite satisfactory. Having obtain a Vietnam visa to leave the airport in Ho Chi Minh during a 14 hour stopover was a bit of a pain but that is not the airlines fault. Based on last years experience we decided to use Vietnam Airline again for return Business Class tickets from Melbourne to London. The first problem was the online booking. The site is quite tricky to negotiate and often you have to get all the way through before you are advised the flights don’t exist. When you do get to actually book the site will not accept your credit card. I contacted the “Helpdesk” which could not have been less helpful. Eventually I had to download the VA app. and do the booking through that. I then had another issue I need sorted. I rang the “Helpdesk” but despite perseverance was totally unable to follow the staff members English. She was also very curt and hung up while I was still endeavouring to follow what she was saying. I then emailed the several addresses on the VA website setting out my query in detail. Responses from VA took around 7 days and were universally dismissive. They did not address my concerns at all and the one line reply essentially amounted to , “we cannot and will not offer assistance”. Very unprofessional and frustrating. It appears once off the ground the airline shows some potential but on the ground it is still very much stuck in a communist mindset."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo Narita to Da Nang via Ho Chi Minh,December 2023,2.0,2.0,,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I had the misfortune of booking this airline for a family trip to Da Nang, Vietnam. The airline emailed on multiple occasions to adjust the flight time and seating ahead of the trip. 24hrs beforehand, it was not possible to complete online check-in despite getting multiple emails from Vietnam Air asking me to check-in online. On the day, queues at the flight check-in desk were out of control and it took two hours to check into the flight. The airline didn't open the check-in until 30mins after the scheduled departure time. The flight departed two hours behind schedule. Inside the plane, my daughter's screen didn't work. The coffee on board the flight was good and the service was OK too. After arriving two hours late, we missed our connection from Ho Chi Minh to Da Nang. An alternative booking was made for 3 hours later. Upon arriving in Da Nang we were informed that our bags had been left in Ho Chi Minh (this seemed to affect at least 20-30 people on this flight). We were promised their return by 11.30pm that night but didn't receive until 12.30am. The bags eventually arrived soaking wet."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Dalat via Ho Chi Minh City,December 2023,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,3.0,1,no,2,"  My family of 11 booked our flight to Vietnam in Dec 2023, flying via HCM to Dalat. Even before we set off, the airlines emailed us 3 times to inform of flight changes due to operational reasons. It not only caused us stress due to disruption to our tour schedule but also incurring international call cost to make alternative arrangements. There is also inconsistency in their procedures. When we call their customer service line, we were told that because our transition time is less than 100 minutes, we have to change to a later flight and asked us to email in our request. After I have sent in my request for change, I received a reply that said that their ground staff can help us with our transit even though our transit time is only 95 minutes. The only consolation was that the customer service of their air crews were good. Vietnam Airlines needs to improve their flight schedule planning in order to call themselves a 4 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Da Nang to Nha Trang,November 2023,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,3.0,1,no,1,"  Check in was a breeze but there after everything went down hill with lounges, service & journey. Our check-in was 05.30am for a 7.10am departure and we headed to the Lotus Domestic Lounge and it had a poor selection of food just Viet Soups and Noodles no real breakfast items of such just fruit and sweet rolls. We had coffee and thought we would get some form of breakfast offering in Business Class for a 7am departure, how wrong was we on board the crew looked tired and offered a juice and cold towel service not a bad start. I could smell something from the galley thinking maybe croissants or a meal. Once we took off we were offered Coffee or Tea then waited and waited and nothing. I left my seat to use the bathroom and the crew were huddled in the galley with the curtain closed eating hot food and looked shocked.  Never before have I taken a short business flight and not been offered a cookie or pretzel and the flight is scheduled at 1 hour 15 minutes so plenty of time to give some service , but sadly not to be Vietnam airlines we pay a premium for what? On descending they come from behind the curtain full from breakfast whilst us fools paying business class had our pants taken down. Awful flight from start to finish."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Shanghai to Singapore via Hanoi,November 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," I swear I will never take Vietnam Airlines again. This is the worst flight experience I ever had. I am travelling with this airline with connection time more than 12 hours. And I actually suffer to just wait outside the boarding gate during this period. No crew from Vietnam Airlines guiding. No food and beverages provided as promised. No transit tour provided as broadcast. How can this airline nominated as 4 star airline with such poor service. Before my flight, I actually contacted the airlines and was assure that the staff will take guide me through when I arrived Hanoi Airport. At the end, no one knows. I go to the airline connection flight counter, no one there. Go to LOTUS Lounge, said not entitled to. Felt I am paying for 4 star airlines and treated as in I am taking budget airlines. The flight VN531 was also very terrible. Is just a budget craft without inflight entertainment and small seat. Luckily I didn't upgrade to business class when checked in because the business class is actually just a curtain away from economy class. Trust me, I shocked when I onboard the flight just now. The flight supposed to fly at 3.25pm, but only move at 4pm. Supposed to arrived at 6.55pm, at the end arrived at 7.30pm. I wonder the flight duration took longer than estimated because the flight is old? Very huge turbine noise when the flight flying up. Anyway, I just felt blessed that I arrived safely. Conclusion, I paid for so called 4 star flight but ended with budget airlines service. Listen to me, I am writing now while overnight at Departure Gate of Hanoi Airport. Not worth for your trip with Vietnam Airlines."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DaNang to Ho Chi Minh City ,November 2023,4.0,4.0,,,,1.0,3,no,1,"   This review is for people considering flying with your pet with Vietnam Airlines. The only word, a nightmare from ticketing to all the check-in processes. Ground staffs at both SGN and DAD are both useless and heartless with no clear procedures, not owning any responsibility, having attitude toward travelers. I had my tickets issued, giving all the necessary information of my puppy to have her with me on board and got the validation of VNA, then VNA called back, just saying that she had to be checked in without further notice or explanation! Upon check-in process in Saigon, I showed all the docs as requested, then the check-in agent informed me that they need the approval of the captain of the flight… point that had never been communicated. The “supervisor” came to repeated the same words, not taking ownership or consideration of someone traveling with a pet, then who might be “refused” by the captain, under the pretext of safety for my pet! The whole thing went on and on with them saying that if you are not happy, call VNA. And they are VNA staff. On the way back, VNA staff at DAD airport asked me to show another paper which was not requested on the other flight. Then they said they need the approval of the captain again as we are not in rules! The whole procedures went on and on and they did not event clearly know their procedures. When I challenged them, they asked me to call VNA while I talked to the highest person at the VNA office there (or pretendedly). That agent dared lecturing me for my next flights’ knowledge when VNA staffs was not event cohesive on their own procedures! And for her, the fault is on SGN airport staffs’ side! The top of it was that one agent informed me that my pet will be sent out to the aircraft as an “oversized” luggage!!! Then again, the highest person of VNA at DAD airport had to show up again, and again it’s not her fault. I had to precise to them that the procedure is to have someone personally take my pet to the aircraft and then bring her from the aircraft to the terminal. Therefore, please consider before putting you into the troubles with the ground staff of VNA, as they are arrogant, heartless and non comprehensible and they are not event trained to have the same procedures and standards! Expect to have multiple explanations and you should know your points and rights if you don’t want your pet to be let behind because of a bunch of untrained staff. VNA cabin staff have improved tremendously and I am flying all the time with them, but ground staff, only one word, a nightmare. As a part of this whole experience, VNA should have 0/10 and they should own it to improve and to be truest what they pretend to be!"

I arrived at Changi airport at 12pm and there were already long queue in front of check-in counter (seem like longest one in the whole terminal). I have to wait for almost 1 hour to check in my baggage and get my boarding pass. I've never had to wait that long before, even if with cheap airlines."

The good things are: fast check-in and security at departure, fast deplaning and luggage pickup at arrival, outstanding cabin service. The bad things are: uncomfortable and overcrowded lounge at SGN, uncomfortable and overcrowded boarding experience at SGN, business class seats on the A321 aircraft ALWAYS have a broken headrest, you are locked in if the person ahead of you decides to recline and row 1 is usually reserved for VIP’s."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh City to Tokyo Narita,November 2023,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,2.0,2,no,4,"  Vietnam Airlines is just simply horrible. This is like a budget airline and their customer service is non-existent. I had an issue with their flight and needed their help. I chatted with a customer service agent online and she/he just ended the conversation abruptly after telling me that I needed to email customer care. They didn't even wait for me to say anything else just said ""bye"". Then I emailed customer service twice and that was 7-8 days ago and still no responses and I already took the flight. I will never fly with them again. The plane was not cleaned properly when I flew them and my food was horrendous. The croissant was dry and inedible. The chicken rice was gross. Flight attendants were lukewarm at best and they didn't even care to go around to make sure that all tray tables were up and seats were in an upright position. Avoid this airline at all costs."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SGN Ho Chi Minh City to CXR Nha Trang,November 2023,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5.0,5,yes,8, Very good flight. Excellent seat pitch. Departed on time and arrived 15 minutes early. During the flight a bottle of water was handed out. Only complaints were about the behaviour of the passengers. Many dragged so much into the cabin that overhead storage was overflowing. While waiting to disembark people got really pushy. The cabin crew did not intervene in any way. Apparently this kind of behaviour is the norm on flights in Vietnam.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Fukuoka via Ho Chin Minh,November 2023,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Summary, please avoid buying Vietnam Airlines if you have not done so. I will rate minus stars if there is such an option. We have flew Vietnam Airlines long ago and were happy. So we thought we can do it again and paid for 6 persons to fly November 2023 to Fukuoka via HCM. Our confirmed flights were then changed unilaterally by Vietnam Airlines and no information was provided to us. The flights that were changed by VA could never have happened as the flight timings overlap (SG to HCM and HCM to Hanoi). I wrote in on 19 August 2023 and was directed to online support on 24 August. This is where the nightmare service began. We have to settle for a change in flights, that cut short our original holiday and suffer some travel costs (accomodation, travel insurance) that are non-refundable. After almost 2.5 months of writing emails and waiting in good faith, Vietnam Airlines will not compensate us, nor extend any goodwill to make good the unnecessary costs. No manager has contacted me too. This episode has caused caused unnecessary stress to my family."

Everything is just middling. The only real issue I've had with them (flown many legs over the years) is the advertising is extreme. You're subjected to (the exact same) like 15min ads on every flight, and the captains have to give these minutes-long speeches at the start/end of each flight that include airline promotions. For shorter flights it feels like you're just in a tubular advertisement for most of it. That aside, no major issues to report and the planes are in fairly good shape and clean.  Flights are usually very cheap in-country too. Unlike a lot of US airlines, they actually serve meals on shorter flights. I had a 2hr flight with VA that had a meal, versus a 4hr fligth with AA that had none."

When we finally got to Paris, they had lost my luggage. It took them days to locate the luggage. Once they advised that they had found it, they said they would bring it to my hotel in Spain. It never turned up. I then called the airline and after being transferred to different departments numerous times, they admitted that they had lost my luggage again. After hours and hours on the phone, I found out my luggage had been passed by Vietnam airlines to 2 other airlines (Air France and Iberia) but was told that Vietnam airlines was still responsible for the luggage and was overseeing it. When trying to locate the luggage I was told by the other airlines that it wasn't their responsibility and to contact Vietnam airlines, they in turn blamed the other airlines. I was finally told by a lovely person at Iberia that Vietnam airlines had closed my case (I still hadn't received my luggage). She also advised that my luggage was in Lugo (she said she should be telling me this, but felt sorry for me) and I was told ""under no circumstances that I should go to the airport and try and claim my luggage, as I didn't have any email/ proof that the luggage was there"". As I had been without luggage for over a week and a half, against her advice, I then drove to the airport (hours away from where I was staying), lied and said I was told to come and pick it up, they then handed my my luggage. It is months later after numerous emails and phone calls back and for with Vietnam airlines, the compensation I have been offered it $80 USD for; lost luggage, petrol costs to try and go and claim my luggage, hours and hours lost on my holiday on the phone to the airline/s. They cant give me the money because I can not produce the first luggage tag that was on my bag. The worst airline I have ever flown with."

I found the quality of the plane, the cabin crew and the meals to be perfectly acceptable, in fact they are challenging some much more expensive airlines. My wife and I flew to Paris and will return for under half the price charged by our national airline, Qantas. The cabin was clean, my seat was a little cramped but still allowed me to get some sleep. Entertainment was quite good with many English speaking movies or subtitles. The cabin crew were attentive without being over bearing and the food and wines served were very good. I will certainly be using Vietnam Airlines again as an option to fly to Europe. We will be stopping over in Vietnam on the way back due to the need to fly into Hanoi and then out of Ho Chi Minn. However a small inconvenience considering the price and service we had. Interestingly I had an issue pre flight and I rang the airlines call centre in Vietnam. I received almost immediate service, an English speaking customer service officer who understood my query and fixed it, you can't get that from Qantas in our own country!"

The flight was cancelled, though they did send an e-mail to inform me, but it sent to my spam folder which I was not aware of. Furthermore there is no new itinerary provided as to which Terminal the new flight will depart! There was a 5 hrs delayed because of the change of flight and it delayed another hour before take-off. Here I would like to suggest that the Airline should send a SMS to my mobile phone as double assurance that the customer will receive the changes."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Hanoi ,September 2023,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5,yes,9," Great flight with friendly crew and good food. Check-in was a bit chaotic and due to unknown reasons we had to check our luggage at the odd-size counter. Boarding isn't up to the standards of other Skyteam members and they first let Economy passengers board before Premium and Business Class passengers. The plane itself is clean and well maintained. The seat pitch itself is good and whilst people complain its too narrow, that's the same with every Dreamliner. The only thing which is annoying about the seat is the remote control on top of your arm rest. You will hit accidently the buttons sometimes and is less comfortable to rest your arm on. I asked for an extra pillow to cover the armrest and the crew arranged this without any difficulty. The IFE is pretty basic, but worked well and had enough options (if you don't fly them regularly like me it's fine). You can use your own headphones (only wired) and would suggest to do so. Far better sound quality. We got hot towels after take off. Pre meal snack and drink, two dinner options and plenty of snacks available after dinner and before breakfast. Crew walked by with drinks throughout the flight and responded quickly if you called them. Restrooms were clean and they provide razors and toothbrushes (great add). We departed a bit delayed, but arrived at the scheduled time. Overall can't say anything bad about Vietnam Airlines. Great service and good value for money. On the way back we flew the Airbus 350-900, which is slightly more comfortable plane (no controllers in the armrest and the head rest was better). The service was of similar standards. Will definitely fly them again when I have the opportunity."

Had to report to Air France and was issued a list baggage claim. Contacted Vietnam Airlines and was told sorry for the inconvenience it is being looked into by our lost luggage section. After numerous emails was told it was found and will arrive next day. Five days later and many emails baggage arrived. We had to buy essential items, as well as missing out on day tours as we were told it was arriving and we needed to be home to accept it which didn’t happen. Five days of the start of our holiday was a nightmare and they showed no empathy. Finally luggage arrived and then I asked about compensation which after numerous emails was told we could get $80 US but needed a bank account in Europe. We live in Australia so why would we have a European bank account? Now we are trying to get our seats for return trip which although we booked on Vietnam Airlines site one of the legs Paris to Saigon is with Air France at business class have been told by Vietnam Airways we need to contact Air France and sort this out ourselves. What sort of airline does this? We paid for a service with Vietnam Airlines and now told we have to contact Air France and organise our seats? No customer service and extremely disappointed in they way we are being treated after paying a lot of money for very poor service and they have no interest in helping us!"

No complaints from me. I would fly Vietnam Airlines again for sure."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London to Sydney via Hanoi / Ho Chi Minh City,August 2023,,,,,,1.0,3,no,1,   Do not fly with Vietnam Airlines. I booked online on their website. When I arrived to catch my flight I was told I needed a Visa for stopping in Vietnam even though I was only in transit. This was not mentioned when I booked the flight and was not on any of my ticketing or correspondence. There were 5 people travelling London to Sydney on my flight who needed Visas. Apparently there is a similar number on every one of these flights. We were told we could get urgent Visas at a cost of US$275. We googled Vietnam Visas and 3 of the 5 of us went to scam sites (apparently there are several and this happens to airline customers all the time). We were unable to catch out flight. The replacement flights cost several thousand extra dollars as well as causing stress and anxiety of going through this process. Vietnam Airlines is well aware of this situation and does not advise customers that a Visa may be needed (until they try and board a plane) and does not prove any advice on how to get authorised Visas at the gate.

We flew with Vietnam airlines before even on a shorter distance their service was great, but I was disappointed they changed us to a less quality airline without notice. We sent vietnam airline an email about our concern and they sound like it's not their fault and the service we got was from  Pacific airline not from Vietnam airline. Be careful when booking with Vietnam Airlines, they can switch you to a different airline that is so bad that they don't even offer a complimentary water on a 3hrs flight."

On board service lovely and attentive - nice hot meal served and red and white wine as an alcohol choice. I wasn't too well on the flight and crew offered me hot lemon water and enquired about my welfare.

Unfortunately the seats in the plane were not comfortable for the long flight. Made for small people. Hardly space to eat or sleep. Especially for the arms, sharing the same armrest with your neighbor. Also not practical that the buttons of the lights and sound system are on the armrest, constantly pressing them in the night. The headphones are terrible, not fitting and bad sound quality. No option to use your own headphone via Bluetooth or cable. Dinner and breakfast on the plane was ok."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phu Quoc to Ho Chi Minh City,September 2023,1.0,5.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  What a terrible experience. Their customer service made me buy a new ticket! So, I have flown quite a bit over the past 10 years, so I have booked plenty of tickets. Several times I have been asked to use my initials instead of my full name when booking, because my full name doesn't fit on the boarding pass. As such, I have grown accustomed to using my initials 'FP' when booking my tickets, and have never had a problem with this whatsoever. However, when checking in with Vietnam Airlines, they told me this wasn't possible. I was sent to customer service. After a lengthy argument, they made me buy a new ticket or they wouldn't let me on the flight. Truly outrageous! I would have been fine with paying a small fee to change the name on the ticket (it was still 2 hours before the flight and I hadn't checked in any luggage). This airline has terrible customer service and would absolutely not recommend it. The weirdest part is that I flew with one of their competitors VietjetAir just a week before, using my initials, also a domestic flight in Vietnam, and there was no issue whatsoever."

Uncomfortable seats that had masking tape on the table and media stows due to wear and tear, leg rests were almost non existent and barely lifted my feet off the floor, were given only slippers no eye covers.

We had to cancel one holiday completely due to constant flight changes and a customer service team that is non-responsive and not at all understanding or let alone helpful. Another time I got stranded in Ho Chi Minh for more than a day with refusing to pay for reasonable accommodation, transport costs or compensation owed under EU law. While ticket prices are tempting, I would argue it's not worth the pain of dealing with constant flight changes (by days, not hours!) and delays."

Airport is a architectonic pearl, giving vision, space, and a feeling of wealth and prosperity. It (‘terminal 2’) was built in very short time. It is a huge mastodont, impressive, over-dimensioned, could handle 20-50 times more passengers. Actual passengers no. are only +/-1500/per day. Further, the International section is virtually dormant. I deem 3 employees per passenger, insane! Check-in in Hue was easy and overkill: 1. online, 2. machine, and 3. eventually manual at desk. Respected as SkyTeam elite traveller and earned XP to my Flying Blue Program with KLM/AF. New Song Huong (Perfume River, named after Hue’s main river) lounge is a nice boutique lounge, fair, diverse catering, panoramas, and does the job. Captain was a Danish national, Nicolas, we had an extensive chat at departure, as we share nationality. He was very informative onboard as we flew. My A321 aircraft had 16 seats in classical outfitted 2 x 2 huge, comfortable business class seats with 50% wider space as the layout in eco has two seats more per row. I was almost alone in business with only 2 young women behind me. Service impeccable, but food onboard is a joke/gimmick despite being served in VIP manner. Drinks, beers, and snacks available. Newspapers with choice (hardcopy) given to everybody, a rare gesture these days, haven’t seen in Europe for years. FAs gave me 110% attention, just lift my eyes to get any additional service. Conservative, old-fashioned, yes. But very valuable, cost friendly (125 USD), and the product is hugely appreciated. A relentless high standard retaining old values and comfort. Predeparture drinks offered. IFE on shared monitors was so, so. No WiFi, bit who cares on a 85 minutes flight. We left early and arrived 30 min. ahead time. I went straight into reserved bus, took off 15 seconds later. Luggage on belt as I arrived. All in all perfect, speedy, attended instantly, hardly lost a Minute from Check-In to leaving Hanoi Airport. They further do not demand luggage tags while exiting, speeding up everything. Given miles and tier-points instantly."

I was travelling with my wife from Melbourne to Vietnam and then to Frankfurt. A lot of people faced problem with screens which were not working at all and I was one of them. Asked cabin crew about it, they asked me to reset it which I did many times throughout my journey and it still didn't work. They asked me to change seat but just for one of us which I denied. It was a long 7:30-8 hours flight and without entertainment it's really difficult to pass the journey."

(VN31). After going through the security check, I realized that my jacket was still hanging on the other side, even before the custom check. I asked one of the security men what to do. He advised me to go to the gate, and talk there with somebody of the Staff of Vietnam Airlines. After waiting there for a while, a man arrived who took care of two older people in wheelchairs. I explained him the situation and asked him for help. Without further ado he took action and walked back with me to the security check. There he asked me to wait, went trough the security check, found my jacket within one minute and brought it back to me. Needles to say that made me very happy. I want to express my sincere gratitude to this man, of whom I don't know the name. He showed me what real service means, and did a good job for Vietnam Airlines. So in the future I will fly again with Vietnam Airlines, also because of this show of great service."

The lukewarm food (still served with tongs as if the plates were red hot) was the least of the problems. Landed two hours late.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Paris via Vietnam ,June 2023,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,1,no,1," Most terrible experience ever. The flight from Sydney to Paris involved two changes in Vietnam (via Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi). Two really bad things happened: 1) Suitcase lost (possibly in Vietnam) and there is absolutely no easy way to communicate with anyone to help you find it. I filed a report in Paris and received a reference number to track it through the worldtracer system. I arrived in Paris on the 17th of June and the good news was that the system showed the suitcase was found in Vietnam and was about to arrive in Paris on the 20th. It must have arrived in Paris but there seems to be no system at the airport to receive it? I was leaving Paris on the 23rd to other parts of Europe. It is now the 1st of July and no signs of the suitcase. After 100s of phone calls to phones that nobody picks up and many emails (a great way to spend your holiday), I got hold of the lost and found department of Vietnam Airlines who seem to know more or less of what I know through the worldtracer system. They can at least do some of the chasing and seem more effective than I on providing updates. I only got hold of these people after contacting the headquarters online email of Vietnam Airlines ([email protected]). The initial response from that email address was useless too because they recommended me checking their website which I of course already had done. In summary, I had to keep writing the same thing many times until I started talking to the lost and found people in France. I of course had to buy these days many clothes and other essential survival items. The lost and found person voluntarily offered 80 USD for compensation which I declined because by the time someone deposits this amount in my bank account, the bank will take most of it in fees. To cut a long story short: avoid it, especially if you have a trip with connection flights and their customer support is close to zero. 2) While leaving from Sydney, half of the plane (essentially everyone heading somewhere else other than Vietnam) was told that because we have to walk to a different terminal in Ho Chi Minh City, we will need a Visa. Yes, it was our responsibility to know that, but nobody knew and nobody would have bought that ticket if they knew. Emergency Visa was offered from the flightcentre at the airport...$500 Australian Dollars per person and overcrowded. I paid for 3 but because the 4th person of my family was Chinese, there was no option for emergency visa so we had to buy a new ticket for that person ($3300 Australian Dollars). Perhaps someone will read this post and avoid these costs in the future. The last, minor issue, was that we had to pick up the luggage at Ho Chi Minh City and check them back in for the connection flight. They were not transferred within the airport. Lesson learnt. "

I understand that this has to do with limitation of the airport facilities, but it does affect customer convenience. The new terminal, which I heard many good things about, was not opened at the time I was there. In flight experience was good overall, with excellent service and care from the crew and good food."

Cabin staff was nice and helpful as usual. This was an one-hour flight, so no food service, but each passenger got a bottle of water, not bad at all. There is no IFE, which was not a problem.

On this occasions we flew Ho Chi Minh - Hanoi - Da Nang - Ho Chi Minh. Each flight was pleasant, staff courteous and efficient and they departed as scheduled. As they were relatively short flights the inflight service was minimal however unlike Scoot who we flew to Ho Chi Minh with they kept the passenger hydrated. The aircraft may not be the most modern however the seats were comfortable, there was ample legroom and most importantly they were clean. Boarding was efficient and easy. Its unfortunate they dont operate from Perth, Western Australia as there would be no need to use any other carrier."

Lounge access is not granted to VNs domestic routes unless if arrived on international Skyteam, flight, preferably VN. Paid 20 USD for access to Lotus Lounge which is impressive, large, well-stocked, and truly worth it. Onboard, I got just water and a tissue. However, they have started to push a trolley around for small, additional catering sales. Did not observe in time and lost my chance. Flight almost on time; luggage was present at arrival. Surprised there was an airbridge, then came the big surprise to my day: went into a completely new, stunning, modern airport in Hue. This shocked me completely; it was not there half year ago. Stable, old-fashioned airline, punctual, and good in communication. Generous with luggage. Miles given quickly.

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh City,June 2023,3.0,3.0,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  During our two week stay in Vietnam we booked three flights weeks in advance. All flights were adjusted and changed within 48 hours of departure, one we weren’t even told about until we arrived for check in. Our final flight which was scheduled to get a connecting flight back to Australia was changed with less than 24 hours notice and put us at risk of being unable to get home. Customer service was impossible to reach on the phone and took hours to respond to multiple emails and Facebook messages ruining the last day of our trip. When we went to check in on this final flight we were told by the staff that we were not in their system even though we had an email confirmation, had chosen seats and had ticket numbers allocated to us in the app. I had to literally cry and beg so that the staff would acknowledge their mistake so that they would issue us with tickets for the flight we needed to be on to get home. I’ve been given no actual apology or compensation for the immense amount of stress they’ve caused over the last 2 weeks, just auto-generated responses from the customer service team."

Me and my wife original flight should be on 27/5/2023 11am VN6854 departure from Changi Airport T4, we reach airport on that day around 7.30am and we proceed to check in counter. Upon reach check in counter only that we found VN6854 flight cancel, we are very confuse and upset how come Vietnam Airline never inform us in advance at all. Upon calling Vietnam Airline Ho Chi Minh customer service hotline (vietnam airline do not have singapore customer service hotline) only we found out they change our flight to 27/5/2023 6:25pm VN654. Because the newly assign flight 7.5hour delay as per our original plan, we request to change flight to earlier flight because we are rushing back to Ho Chi Minh celebrate my father in law birthday. Total I made 7 call to vietnam airline customer just to check can me and my wife change to earlier flight, my calling cost to them definitely more than SGD$150. After so many call they inform us cannot change. Conclusion 1) They never apologise 2) They sent email inform me about the original flight cancel on 27/5/2023 8:24am 3) they never compensate for the mistake they make 4) me and my wife miss father in law birthday 5) Total we wait at Changi airport T4 more than 11 Hour, that super long day and tired. All this can be avoid if Vietnam Airline inform client in advance like 1-2week before our flight."

Checking in was ok, boarding the aircraft and disembarking the aircraft is an absolute nightmare, on board cabin layout is terrible, service below average, getting answers from staff members is non existent. Calling and emailing Vietnam airline office to claim missing miles is a horrible experience do not ever consider using LOTUS MILES, this is the worst frequent flyer program available. "

I really like the space on the A350 (cabin and toilets were really spacious) but what I disliked was the constant change of schedules (we had 4 flights and 3 of the schedule changed last minute which made our planning quite difficult). I would like to fly with them again but the schedule changes makes things a challenge and really needs to be addressed.

However from Ho Chi Minh to Sydney a different story. First the Aircond was not working well very hot, in the bathroom it was cooler. My entertainment screen was not working . I was told they re boot it that did not happen. I was told they shift us, then the Cabin Manager said the flight was full. They did give me a mini laptop but that didn’t work as well. So I gave up. You couldn’t sleep on the plane due to the heat. The food was horrible too. I am surprised they didn’t give passengers the toothpaste set like they did on the plane going over. Before we landed the Cabin Manager said we do better next time. Which didn’t help us at all on this flight. I put it down as the Cabin Manager was very young, and had no much experience Customer Service. This is not the standard of Vietnam Airlines very poor."

Seating in economy was fine. Inflight entertainment, although the interface was slow had a couple of films I’d not seen. The food was surprisingly good! Serviced with metal (not plastic) cutlery. Made the journey more enjoyable. One of the basins in the loos became blocked - staff addressed this as soon as they were aware. Cabin temperature was fine"
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Economy Class,Danang to Bangkok,March 2023,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,5,yes,8,"  Danang to Bangkok 9 March 2023 on a narrowbody A321 aircraft. On time. Good deal; less than 100 USD. SKYTEAM privileges were granted in full despite the ticket was shamelessly cheap. Thus, VN overrules competitors on this route, even my favourite well-pampering local airline Bangkok Airways which in this case lose out to VN on price, lounge, and luggage allowance. The LCC carriers are a no go on this route as they end up expensive and/or unreliable. Worse is that they don’t provide any luggage transfer in Bangkok, forcing pax to go landside and check it in again. Vietnam Airlines have almost never any delay nor cancellation on this route. Check in could not transfer my luggage to final destination, though at least to next destination (Doha with QR). Da Nang International (T2) is dominated by SE-Asian tourists and a lot number of small airlines. Larger aircrafts cant enter the airport as it is in the middle of the city. The Airport is completely renovated and a pleasure. Check-In fast and easy I was treated with a lot of respect due to SKYTEAM status, despite I was travelling on cheapest ticket possible. I could get my 23x2 kg checked it without any questions and I also had two hand-luggages. The Lotus Lounge, that Skyteam-airlines use, is extremely nice and well maintained; it is a huge, unexpected gem find in a small airport. The Lounge has very good food offerings; cold delicatesses, and at least 7 hot meals in buffet. Drink options are a bit below average and only cheaper, local products (2 cheap wines and 4 beer brands, all alike) are offered. Background music appreciated. The décor is of high standard; even smoking and business rooms exist. The lounge appears underutilised, I found only 5-10 other visitors during the 3 hours I spent there. The flight itself was stable and regular. Crew were courteous; food modest only a sandwich tray and drinks were offered. Without requesting it, I was given a seat in the first row after business class – that granted me wide leg space. Luggage transferred correctly as promised and tagged. Good value for money, reliable, and recommended."

Then somehow we end up with a different airline, Pacific Airlines. Seem like the combine both airlines together. Pacific Airlines was not up to my expectation with Vietnam airlines. They have some sticky tape stuck to the chair. It look like they use it to attach on-off other equipment. The flight was not enjoyable. To sum up, Vietnam Airlines combine our fly with other airlines without announcements before hand. Furthermore, Pacific Airlines was not up to our expectations with Vietnam airlines. Do not be fooled like us."

Call center and website deficiencies need work, however it redeems itself in the air. My first interaction for this trip which was the website to manage my booking to select my seat and special meal request did not work as it was a Delta ticket using miles, so I did not get the best first impression. Subsequently, I called the call center in Vietnam to order my special meal and was informed that no meals were provided for both legs of my flight. Fast forward to the flight, meals were served on both legs which left me vexed by the misinformation. Airport experience was standard, but the employees didn’t seem too well versed on the procedures as important ones such as making a boarding announcement and reassigning seats after ticket issuance seemed unfamiliar to the staff. I also did not enjoy the double security I had to undergo since my itinerary had a connecting flight and needed to swap terminals when transiting in Hanoi. On the flipside, the airline got some things right. Albeit being unable to order a special meal, the standard ones served were fantastic! There was even bubble tea sold for a modest $2 USD! The inflight crew did a fine job, not exceeding nor falling below expectations on this red eye flight and the entertainment had some good choices. Overall, not a bad airline, but they have some work to do with fine tuning staff training and fixing the poor website."

Never use this airline unless its a last resort they are totally useless. Also trying to talk to customer service in Ho Chi Minh airport is impossible as they just ignore foreigners and serve Vietnamese people first. Incredibly rude."

Luckily, I was aware of a 16 hour layover on return journey. Despite this, I enjoyed a day in Hanoi. The flight itself was quite pleasant, and the staff were very polite and were really helpful with my age (71) with very good food. However the nightmare began when I requested the posting of frequent flier miles. The first response was standard, we will reply within 5 days. Was advised of only 1000 miles, and requested documentation, sent within 24 hours, This went back and forth to the end result being told to send more documentation, I forwarded everything but my original boarding pass, difficult given that it was an electronic boarding pass to my phone. Three months/ 21 emails/ numerous Facebook messages later advised to call lotusmiles in Vietnam (unfortunately they could not assist as they did not speak English) but to send email.

If you're an Australian flying home get your transit visa. I can't emphasize that enough. Even if you think you don't need it. Unless you dig deep enough, you won't know when you need it. I had a double layover in Vietnam, and was unable to board without it. On my flight to Paris from Sydney through Ho Chi Minh, I didn't need it. And that flight, layover and all was extremely pleasant. Many family, colleagues & friends (even those who are Vietnamese), recommended not using them. And initially I thought they were incorrect, that I had a nice flight to Europe with them. I arrived at Paris CDG Airport to fly home 4 hours before my flight, but when I attempted to check-in I was asked for my transit visa. I didn't even apply for one, no one, neither the airline or my booking agent (Flight Network) informed me I needed one. My searches on Google weeks prior didn't inform me I needed one. I was on the phone to the Australian Embassy, DFAT, my travel insurance, no one could help me without 2 days notice to process my application. I was stranded 4 days before my brother's wedding. I called Vietnam Airlines, they wouldn't answer my call, after 10 minutes on hold, the call was automatically disconnected, the check-in staff couldn't help me. I couldn't even attempt to rebook my flight to a later date. They simply told me, it was my booking agent's fault not theirs. No refund, no credit, no rebooking. No one here showed any accountability or empathy. My first time solo travelling, it was midnight at home, no one could help me. I've never felt so abandoned and helpless. My travel insurance couldn't even confirm if they would cover this issue. The cheapest flight home that day cost me AU$4,200 and was horrible. I don't think it would be hard to add a single line to the booking website or the airline to tell Australian's flying home that they would need a transit Visa."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hi Chi Minh City to Frankfurt via Hanoi,January 2023,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2,no,2,"  I flew for the first time with Vietnam Airlines. From 31/12/2022 until 12/01/2023 I took 5 flights with them, 2 long distance Frankfurt HCMC and back and 3 domestic flights. The international flights were horrible. Very poor quality of food, I had no choice of food, they only gave me 1 small bottle of water for the whole flight. They never come to ask if you need anything to drink. The seats where very poor quality.  Staff not so friendly, probably due to high work pressure. For the domestic flights there were 2 delays out of my 3 flights a flight of nearly 2 hours HCMC- HAN delayed for 2 hours for a flight that takes only 2 hours. Very poor communication. I will never take this airline again for long distance flights. They say they want to achieve the 5 star rating. But In my opinion they not worth the 4 star.  Transfer in domestic airport very poorly organized. I travel with only hand luggage and online check in, still was forced to check in at the counter. Hanoi international departure was horrible. Your transfer does not exist and your prior Vietnam Airlines does not work. I understand now why you have so many delays. You can always rate an airline by its economy seats. Maybe not worth it to safe few €$100 for such a uncomfortable flights."

Everything felt fine: seat was standard, no fuss from staff, and flight attendants provided their routine service in an efficient manner albeit the full flight. I ordered the special low-fat meal and to my surprise, it was quite appetizing. I also appreciated the amenity kit as the case proved useful and durable throughout my travels unlike other ones I’ve gotten. My minor gripes had to do with the limited selection of movies and tv programs to choose from, minor delay in Bangkok with no proper communication and the absence of a foot rest. My big gripe has to do with how antiquated the website and online services are. Inputting details like FQTV and requesting special meals wasn't user-friendly. Overall, Vietnam Airlines provided reliable service, leaving me with no major hang ups and getting me to my destination soundly."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Sydney to Hanoi,December 2022,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," The ultimate trip from hell, courtesy of Vietnam Airlines. I will NEVER fly or recommend them again. Why? Due to “operational reasons”, my flight from SYD arrived 3 hours late and I would likely miss my connecting flight. VA informed me of this and asked me to email them. I did and suggested an easy alternative (depart SYD 2 days later instead of adding a 24h layover in Hanoi). They finally responded by email - and didn’t give me what I wanted. Instead, they intentionally added 24h layover. At Sydney airport, staff were not able to change this, not able to check my luggage through, not willing to upgrade me, not prepared to provide any information about what I would do in HAN for 24h or where I would be staying. Upon arrival in HAN, me and 7 other premium economy / economy passengers were made to wait for 2 hours before we were escorted to the WORST AND OLDEST hotel ever, Hotel Victory in Hanoi. That’s when the worst thing happened: We did not get individual rooms but were told to SHARE A ROOM WITH A COMPLETE STRANGER. Customer service is absolutely atrocious, the IFE sucks with no decent content, everything else about this airline is very average. But basically: If things go wrong, you’re absolutely on your own. NEVER EVER choose Vietnam Airlines!!!"
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Business Class,Bangkok to Hue via Saigon,December 2022,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,4.0,3,yes,7,"  Bangkok-Saigon-Hue close to New Year 2023. Both flights on A321. Both flights ½ hour delayed, which is acceptable on a last Friday prior to New Year. Check-in in Bangkok not very professional (could not communicate well, did not know African cities, could not retrieve info of my luggage from previous flights). However, in the end I got my business class privileges incl. fast track for security and enjoyed the Miracle, which is a 3rd party, quite disappointing lounge. Lounge provided in SGN (domestic) was the Le Saigonnais, which had good food and (only) soft drinks. Luggage arrived perfectly on both destinations; had to collect it and check it in again in Saigon due to the international arrival from Bangkok to the domestic next flight. On board I found a traditional, ample business class seating. FA-staff were courteous, caring, and very attentive. On both flights I had amble space with pleasant, wide, large seats in a 2 x 2 configuration (4 rows); less than half of the 16 seats were taken. Wet towels provided, likewise welcome drinks. As for food, I got the verbal choice (no menu) of hot and cold snacks and drinks, appropriate for short flights. Asked on both flights if I cared for more food and drinks. Table cloth, steel cutlery and proper glasses were provided. Champagne is not any longer served on regional flights, only wine. The white wine was completely undrinkable: a cheap French sauvignon which is unsellable in Europe, but VN seems pleased to have made a good deal by paying for garbage, feeding their passengers with substandard (toxic?) drinks. 2-4 Vietnamese beers were offered, also on the domestic leg. IFE is on shared monitors with VN inspired programme of agriculture, tourism, and culture. No sound, unless you use own headsets. Call bell answered with seconds. Overall, a consistent, classic, and roomy product."

All journeys were consistently good, with some features excellent. I booked direct with the company and got a competitive deal, cash sale no points used. Booking process fine, only issue was a necessary & understandable re routing to avoid Russia/Ukraine/Afghanistan airspace which meant a change to connecting domestic flight times. I was given a week's notice of this but had to call their customer service in Vietnam from the UK to rearrange, which was handled well but was an expensive international call. Airport check in all very good, Premium Economy has fast track check in with this airline, with staff polite and eager to help even coming through to security to find me and alter a very minor detail. Any inconvenience was created by official & tedious Vietnamese bureaucracy at their airports rather than the airline itself, with countless levels of repeated and unnecessary security checks by disinterested and brusk stuffed uniforms. Premium Economy seat comfort excellent: room to stretch out even for me at 6ft1in, enough width for proper personal space and a massive recline with leg rest. Not so good the headphones, not noise cancelling and pretty useless, I have poor hearing and even on max volume the surrounding aircraft noise was louder than the entertainment channels, making its use impossible. Also the cabin upholstery and fittings looked slightly worn & tired, with some people's seat features not working; I think a mild re-fit is needed. Food & drink (for an Economy + cabin) was very good, with pre flight juice offered, a prompt towels, drinks & snack service once in the air and a very good main meal served shortly afterwards. A second hot meal served before landing. Crew were ultra professional, friendly and attentive for the whole flight; continually visible & coming through to offer drinks and quick to respond to requests. I woke at one point to find a bottle of water had been left for me in my seat pocket by the crew whilst I was sleeping; I would say the crew were an outstanding feature of a generally very good performance throughout. Comparing the international & domestic flights over this tour, the service on the international legs was noticeably more polished than on the domestic routes not that they were bad at all. Take offs were all quite prompt, the worst one delayed by 40 minutes and two of the five pushing back right on the stroke of the scheduled time. Overall a very solid performance throughout, with airport & flight crew service and seat comfort scoring very highly indeed. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend and look forward to flying with them again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo to Paris via Hanoi,November 2022,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,3,"  If you are looking for an airlines that will change your flight to the following day without an explanation, look no further. From other reviews I am seeing online, it also looks like it is a common practice for this company. I booked a flight Tokyo - Hanoi - Paris. For my return (Paris > Hanoi > Tokyo - 18hours), they changed the Hanoi - Tokyo flight to 24 hours later. It appears normal for Vietnam Airlines to let me wait at the airport for that time. No explanations were made, nor any efforts to provide accommodation or any commercial gesture when I reached out to them. Their response? ""Dear Mr. We regret to inform you that due to Vietnam Airlines has informed you about schedule change before departure date so we won't compensate in this case."" When asking if they can assign me a seat with more legroom in the new flight they assigned me? ""We regret to inform that the extra legroom seat applies the fee so we can't support to assign for you via the email. Please kindly access our website Manager booking add ancillaries; seat selection to buy the seat"" When I tried to actually pay to upgrade to premium economy on my longer flight from Paris to Hanoi? ""Because your itinerary has a combination of prices between the 2 itineraries so you cannot upgrade for only flight Paris to HaNoi. If you want to upgrade, you need to upgrade all flights Paris - Ha Noi - Narita to Business class due to flight Ha Noi - Narita don't have premium eco."" At the bare minimum, they did not even offer to pay for a hotel room to avoid me spending one full day waiting at the airport. When trying to find another flight for this connection Hanoi-Tokyo, they suggested to take another flight to Ho Chi Minh, and then to Tokyo. Which would save about 6 hours. What they did not mention or check, is that there was a flight from Hanoi to Tokyo which arrived in Tokyo at the exact same time than what they were suggesting, thus saving this unnecessary additional flight. In short, if you use Vietnam Airlines, be prepared to be left figuring things out on your own when they unilaterally change things. Their best response will be that they covered themselves because they warned you enough time in advance, and if you need to make adjustments, pay for it yourself. "

Basic old fashioned head sets, not noise cancelling, surprises me on a 787. Seats are quite hard very noticeable on a 13 hour flight but do lie flat. Adequate space.

That stated a chain reaction that culminated in missing our connecting flight to Da Nang. The re-scheduled flight was also late amounting to 3 hours overall late. The Premium economy seat was was okay to start with but became more uncomfortable as the journey progressed. The foot rest would not stay up and so I had to wedge my shoe under it to keep it from falling onto my ankle. The recline was difficult to use and I found others struggling to get it to move. The earphones were terrible. The movie selection was also terrible and very limited. There was nothing I wanted to watch. The food was also a bit disappointment given Vietnams reputation for food. As I am into wine again a big let down, there was only one white and one red and of very dubious quality. The crew were good. All of these issues are easily solvable, it appears cost cutting and some poor management decisions have culminated at the customer end. Vietnam Airlines could be great as they have a great crew but they need to get their act together. My first A350 and a big disappointment"

Took hours to check all passengers in at Sydney Airport. No one was notified about a priority line for those who had already done online check-in, nor was there signage. We were told by the employee checking us in that we should have waited in that line. She was not a VN Airlines employee. For the whole flight, most people's in-flight entertainment was not working at all, or otherwise malfunctioning to the point that it could not be used. Staff were not able to offer an explanation other than to reset the screens over and over again - no apology or acknowledgment given. (This was also the same experience on my return flight, 7 days later). Leg room is reasonable for economy, but the seating was hard and uncomfortable. Webbing behind the seats that holds things is extremely tight and cannot fit anymore stuff in there - so the extras they give like a bag with slippers, blanket, pillow, bottle of water etc. you just have to figure out where to place. Some people's chairs leaned back way more than others, and it was very hard to get them to go back and forward."

COVID-19 brought passengers and airlines across the world to a standstill. While some airlines try to mitigate the situation for their passengers, Vietnam Airlines certainly didn't. My flight to Ho Chi Minh City on 30 Jun 2020 was canceled, and I was given two options. I could either take my money back or take a voucher from VN Airlines for 15% more. I chose the second option, as I'm sure I want to go back home with my partner (non-Viet) and I want to go with Vietnam Airlines. These couple of vouchers had an expiry duration of one year. Unfortunately, by the time they expired, the Vietnamese government still hadn't opened their border. We weren't given instructions on how to claim our money back, they simply told us that we're ""entitled to a refund"". Fine, we waited. No money came. We checked in with their Facebook online chat, which didn't help. So we thought maybe the vouchers still worked. Fast forward to June of this year. I contacted their Customer Service online, they told me they can't help me fly nor will they give me my money back. The reason: I didn't fill in a form to ask for my money back. How was I supposed to know that, when they didn't tell me the procedure? In the end, I wasted 3000 euro on two Premium Economy tickets. Vietnam Airlines, do better."

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Melbourne to Frankfurt via Ho Chi Minh,July 2022,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5.0,5,yes,8,"  Melbourne to Frankfurt via Ho Chi Minh and return via Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh (domestic flight). This was a very good fare bought at short notice. The online check-in did not work properly in either direction, but all our airport check-in experiences were friendly and efficient. Boarding was orderly, and the on-board service on all legs was welcoming and courteous. The seat was comfortable with useful storage areas, and the vegetarian food and drink were fine (best vegetarian food was on the leg out of Frankfurt). The various lounges we experienced were good, with the best being at the Hanoi domestic terminal. On the outward journey the transit through Ho Chi Minh was a bit chaotic, as it took a long time for the security officers to come and do the security scans and subsequently lead us to the lounge. The return journey included a domestic leg from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh to pick up the ongoing flight to Melbourne. Our emails to VNA, the Vietnamese consulate and Flight Centre (which sold the ticket) asking about visa requirements went unanswered. After we'd made many attempts to get this information, the VNA office in London finally replied and explained that Australians need a visa to take the domestic flight. My partner obtained an e-visa (as a UK citizen I didn't need one). When we arrived at Hanoi immigration was smooth, and after customs a VNA agent appeared from nowhere to take our luggage and direct us to the domestic terminal. The domestic to international transit in Ho Chi Minh was smooth, apart from immigration taking about 20 minutes to verify the entry visas issued in Hanoi. VNA shows its appreciation to Business Class passengers, with priority screening and boarding lanes that really work, and Business Class buses giving priority when bussing to the terminal is necessary. Overall, despite the transit glitches, it was a pleasant experience and very good value."

As Sky Priority, I was given fast track, VIP bus, and excess luggage, but denied lounge access as a gold card on Skyteam is insufficient apart from VN-airlines own FFP (Lotus). 15 Minutes delays on a busy afternoon is not bad. Onboard, no IFE, only a paper towel and water is served. Clean aircraft. Good flight announcements. Beautiful rainbow scenery on the way to Hue. Bus-gatings are anti-climax on an otherwise fine trip. In Hue, one is not even allowed to walk 40 meters from aircraft to arrivals, what a waste of bus-resources and people’s time. Luggage delivered perfectly. The 65 USD paid is worth it."

Get to the airport in HCMC after my first flight and explain I'd please like to spend the 2.5 hours wait in their lounge as my direct flight from Da Nang was replaced. I was told they don't do a direct flight from Da Nang and the booking confirmation I presented to them was my original booking! At this point there were four members of staff stood opposite me telling me the information I was giving them if incorrect. This obviously wasn't the case, and I showed them my original direct ticket. As SG isn't my final destination, the check in staff asked to see my tickets to my final destination, Thailand, then stated to me that I cannot fly there was I would need to be flying to Bangkok, not Phuket, under current regulations. I was almost laughing out of sheer disbelief, as I've entered Thailand three times already this year, and informed them they are reading out old regulations to me which changed at the start of April. They told me it's likely I'll miss my next flight due to the short changeover time left available to me, and gave me a waiver to sign declaring it's not their fault if I miss the flight - even though they are the reason I now have 45 minutes to exit the plane, clear immigration and check in for my final flight, instead of 90 minutes as per my original booking. I stood for almost 30 minutes at the check in counter in HCMC arguing with their staff about a very simple issue: their changing of my booking will cause me to miss a flight and cause me added expense. I'll try to remember not to fly with this airline again."

For them to finally refund the booking in voucher form so it took me 10+ emails and calls to get a refund for 1 passenger, and then another round of equal efforts for another passenger, until this point it has been 1 month and they still have not refunded me completely yet.

Once arrived at Hanoi Airport one staff of Vietnam airlines was waiting for us to inform us that one of our baggage has lost the id labels and they cannot transfer to the plane to fly to Incheon so we had to go to the luggage belt to get our suitcase. Once at the check in counter at Hanoi airport, they didn't know out of my 3 suitcases which one was the one without id tag. Also they did not want to allow me to fly, because as they said my visa will be rejected in Korea.

There was already an issue when we arrived, as travelers were being turned away in the line in front of us. The counters were cordoned off and there were Vietnam Airline staff, airport staff and police stationed at the entrance to that section. We learnt that Vietnam Airlines were refusing to board anyone who was not a Vietnam National, due to Covid-19. Despite having Australian passports a visa for Vietnam and a booked Vietnam Airlines flight to Sydney, we were not permitted to board. There was no-one stationed at the Vietnam Airlines Support counter either at anytime. We phoned, emailed, messaged our travel agent numerous times and also phoned Vietnam Airlines a dozen times without being able to speak to anybody. We had purchased business class tickets for our return to Australia. We were eventually able to secure economy tickets from another airline to fly home via Singapore. Since our return we have sent numerous emails. Our travel agent informs us that Vietnam Airlines have stated that they will not refund 'partially used tickets' and because we got ourselves to Europe, they don't have to refund us. They recorded all non-Vietnamese citizens as 'no-shows', despite the fact that we were not permitted to reach the check-in counters. It is three months on and we have been told we will not be able to receive any refund for our flights; despite the fact that is was their responsibility to board us or arrange alternative flights for us. The airlines are to their detriment, incredibly poor communicators; the irony of yelling at passengers whilst continuing to welcome us to travel again. Unfortunately, there is no chance we would use this airline again, nor would we recommend them."

I asked for a refund, and they want to refund me only MYR127. I refuse to accept that Covid19 is the reason because they only canceled part of my flight. If they can fly from KUL-SGN, and cancelled SGN-FRA without wanting to refund me, then it isn’t even Covid19. So I do not know why they won’t refund me what I have rights to. How could they just refund me such meagre amount? It is unacceptable. Also, they haven’t replied me after I tried to contact them many times. I have spent so much Skype credits to contact them but all was in vain.  They have nice in-flight comfort and all.

I normally am super positive and like to support the travel industry in as many ways possible, however my experience here has been nothing but terrible. The airline still holds $2600 of my money after acknowledging they would refund me. They are just delaying the process. Will not be recommending Vietnam Airlines to any of my clients travelling to Asia. They may have got $2600 out of me but they will lose so much more business moving forward due to the way they are handling their clients in times of crises.

I was never informed this by email or at check in that the flight service was changing, we were never given a choice to refund or offered any compensation. They did feed us, but the food was very very bad. Pasta salad, a main of (again) pasta, bread. No veg, no fruit. Breakfast was (you guessed it pasta), noodles with meat (there was no choice if you were vegetarian) and a terrible baby food type of custard which was absolutely disgusting, no coffee, no tea. The seats were incredibly uncomfortable also and the plane was completely full, but they had seats in business and first and did not bother to upgrade anyone - even if requested. Also, in the first instance they were not even going to let me board as they told me I could not transit through Australia and I did not have visa, I am from NZ and was allowed to do so, I finally called embassies in Vietnam, NZ and Australia after waiting more than an hour in Da Nang and then also Ho Chi Minh.

The greatest disappointment from Hanoi to Singapore was in an older A321 plane with 2-2 angled seats. This last sector of about 3 hours we could not rest well due to the old & poor Business Class seats. There was no amenities like eye shades, ear plugs nor slippers for Business class on this sector so you should keep your slippers from the earlier A350 flights.

Almost punctual, a minor delay of 20 Minutes was clearly announced in Airport and no further delays incurred. 2nd flight on time. IFE has become a bit better though showing from only small ceiling shared monitors. Earlier IFE was a disgrace by forcefully showing foolish “Hidden Video” episodes in plenum as for Kindergarten incumbents. Arrival and Departure were quick through airbridge gates (Saigon).

First time trying this 4 star airline and based on the prices it charged, it did not disappoint. First flight to Ho Chi Minh City was in a A350 with 1-2-1 lie flat staggered seats. The seats were visibly narrower than the Boeing 787’s reverse herringbone seats. Food was almost inedible but since the Changi Airport Terminal 4 lounge was quite good, we did not mind. Once in Ho Chi Minh City, the 3rd floor lounge was filled to the brim and we were brought to a first floor lounge. Food was below par except for spring rolls. Second sector in Boeing 787’s reverse herringbone 1-2-1 full flat seats (very similar to Finnair’s). Slept OK. All flights were on time and we even arrived in London 45 mins earlier than schedule. On each flight, there was 2-3 very attentive FA with the others being less helpful (more training needed). Did not take the supper but breakfasts was tasty, albeit too small portions. Toilets not as clean. Entertainment not as varied with only about 5 Chinese movies. Overall, recommended to give this airline a try. Keep on improving, Vietnam Airlines."

I was surprised by the high quality of the meal for a 2hr+ flight. Good entertainment was also available. If you fly Vietnam Airlines business class I recommend that you try to select a wide-body flight such as A350 or B787. My past experience with their A32x business class is way below this standard, although it might be worth the price just for the airport experience if you are departing from Hanoi or Saigon."

Excellent meals: So much tasty food. Diverse kinds of drinks, especially liquors; delicious cocktails. Very comfortable seat which could become flat-bed. Clean toilet. In-flight entertainment with lots of movies. Friendly, attentive and enthusiastic flight attendants. Small issue: Menu should state which food is spicy.

On our return flight to Sydney on the 14th October our plane from Da Nang was late and so we arrived with less than 45 mins to run from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2 to meet our international connection. I found it strange that there was no one from the airline to meet or at least guide us in the right running direction. No mention of how to get to to Terminal 2 in their inflight mag as well. We were on our own. Taking my seat I was met with a grunt and frown by our cabin supervisor, she directed us with a  finger point to where we should stow our luggage. As the dinner service went around they eventually ran out of food and I was offered noodles. So no food for me. "

It was my mistake not having a return ticket. Within the previous 24 month I flew 20+ time to Vietnam and never experienced this problem. But I want to complain about the very rude Vietnam Airlines Staff at the Taoyuan International Airport. I didn't reply to my questions regards changing the flight ticket to another flight or if the ticket was still valid after this particular now show. He didn't provide any service hotline (the airport doesn't have a VN Service counter), nor did he try to help to solve this issue. I told him how unfriendly he is and was asking for his real name in order to file a complain. He only said Spencer. Holding my phone in my hand he suddenly accused me of taking a picture of him and and screamed police. The police came and I was able to proof that I didn't take any picture. Meanwhile the flight was gone of course, I still didn't had any service phone number. Even the police just shook their heads. Absolutely unacceptable behaviour of a customer service agent. Quite satisfied with Vietnam Airlines during the last years, this will be a 0/10 rating, although it's not related to the actual flight experience. "

They dimmed out the windows after 15 mins of flying and opened them with 10 mins to landing. And this was a daytime flight dep at 10.15am. Why do that? Or why not advise of the airline’s policy when I pay for a window seat? Hence the lower score from me. The rest was quite good and plenty of leg room was good for long haul. Though cabin crew was young and inexperienced. VN has some ground to cover to catch up with leading Asian airlines.

Ground service depends which airport your in, with Melbourne its just average, with Ho chi minh it could be really slow or really fast. I think it is worth the money because when I looked it was about the 2nd cheapest airline and with my point of view that is were it should be. Seat was pretty comfortable for a domestic and 1-2 hour flight I wouldn't recommend for any longer flight. The food was okay but only had a very small choice. For my flight only fish and fried noodles but they had a large variety of drinks. The in-flight entertainment the screen was only touch screen and they only had wifi connectivity on the new aircraft."

First of all they were nearly all delayed. One was delayed for about 4-5 hours and we were left in Hanoi without any information. They said the plane had a technical fault and wouldn't even give us a time of takeoff. It was actually a bit scary as the flight information was removed from all the flight screens. Warm beer was served to us! Once we arrived in London, when I got home I found my luggage completely soaked and everything needed to be rewashed and afew items damaged. On my return leg I had a long layover in Hanoi so requested to have my luggage delivered there as I was concerned it would get soaked again. They ended up not being able to find our luggage in Hanoi. After a very nervious and long layover and many many calls throughout the long layover, they found our baggage at the airport. The only reason I am giving them a 2nd point is the service on the plane was acceptable. Apart from that, it was a very stressful voyage. My complaints to their complaints department fell on deaf ears and nothing was done about it. I would never fly with them again and advise to avoid."

Despite a (wrongly forecasted) heavy rain, the flight was early. Check-in took seconds, but one can only check in 120 minutes prior to flight. In larger cities you can check-in anytime on the same day, and so should it be as staff in Airport are available. A stupid cost saving measure. Online Check In is not possible. Had 37 kg luggage but was neither notified nor reminded that it was 7 kg over my allowance. They just silently accepted. Had big hand-luggage as well. Lounge provided, though very basic without any hot dishes. Food onboard were 3 very tiny, tired, cold, open sandwiches. Drink service and FAs were excellent. A Miss Giang took care of me with pleasure and passion. Gate bridge in Saigon appreciated. Luggage arrived on belt within 3-4 Minutes after we left the aircraft. Amazing. Good, punctual airline, dull colours onboard, nice, soft, huge classic business seats. Aircraft was leased from Cambodia Angkor Air with their inflight magazines onboard. IFE not connected."

On both days the flight was cancelled. Like all passengers we were subjected to incorrect or misinformation or just lies about when this flight VN 786 was going to leave. Now we are told that we have been booked on a flight to HO Chi Minh tomorrow with no confirmation of our on flight to Hanoi. This has been a public relations debacle for Vietnam Airlines their lack of honesty or even communication with passengers as to the likely outcome of the issue has been nothing short of horrible. No ground crew to properly explain and assist passengers you cant just leave to Qantas staff to take all the heat. The final insult was the presence of 6 uniformed police offices at the loading bay to assist with possible crowd control. So disappointing given very good flights last year.

Baggage handled well. Onboard, I was treated with respect and humble attitude by FAs. Had a pizza for dinner with some Halida beers (my local favorite). Only 8 seats in business class of which 6 was taken. Huge, classical business class seats were very good and soft. In conclusion, no issues, though no extravagancy. Fast track. Affordable ticket, some 130 USD return trip. 32 Minutes delayed departure (arrived 20 Min. late). Airbridge provided in Saigon gives an extra point, otherwise should only be 7/10."

I fly with Vietnam Airlines a lot, I am their Gold Level frequent flyer. I always like the staff consideration, the food and to some extend the comfort of the cabin. However, there are 2 things that they really need to improve. They use too many times the bus to bring the customer from gate to the airplane. I got a bad experience today. It is 35+ degree in Hanoi and they board us by bus. As the sky priority customer, I got to board first. There is a stairs to bring us from gate to the bus. The problem is that I have to wait under the heat for about 5 minute before the bus arrive. This should not be the way an airline should treat its customer. Entertainment on aircraft is quite poor on a 2 hour domestic flight for A321 aircraft."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Ho Chi Minh City to Sydney,August 2019,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,3,no,2,"  Trying unsuccessfully 3 times to do on-line check-in for my flight Ho Chi Minh City to Sydney, I called Vietnam Airlines. But my request must have confused the person answering the phone as I was put on hold for 8 minutes. My sim card balance expired. I then tried emailing the airline at 10am. When I returned to Australia I found that the reply had been received at 4.04pm, after I’d packed my laptop into my bag to head to the airport. Six hours for a reply? It told me that there was a problem with the VNA on-line check in. But there was no message on the VNA website to that effect. At the airport I went to Ticketing who told me the flight was almost full. For a special price of only AUD$180 I purchased an upgrade to premium economy. Boarding lounge 27 was full of intending passengers at the boarding time of 7.55 pm for the 8.15 departure and the Boeing 787-9 was waiting at the air bridge. Then at 8.20, ground staff told everyone to move to gate 22. After arriving there, we sat and waited with no explanation forthcoming. 20 minutes later, buses arrived to transport passengers to the aircraft which was parked a considerable distance from the terminal. Still no explanation. On board we saw the safety video with inaudible sound again. In fact, most of the cabin announcements were inaudible. No aircraft movement until 9.38 with take off at 9.47 – 92 minutes late. Still no explanation. The aircraft could not make up such a late departure so our landing slot at SYD was lost. We landed 0906, almost an hour late. Premium economy was good value at the special price. Better meals and service, large, reclining seat, a lot more leg room, but the same In Flight Entertainment which is poor when compared with other airlines. Not much on this flight scored any points for Vietnam Airlines. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Frankfurt via Ho Chi Minh City,July 2019,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1,no,2,"  Singapore to Frankfurt via Ho Chi Minh City. This is the worse airline by far that we have flown with. First they sent us a change of flight time 2 days before departure (Singapore - Frankfurt) by 2.5 hours earlier! We do not live in Singapore therefore we naturally had pre-booked weeks before a different flight into Singapore, arriving at approx. 3 hours before our original connecting flight with Vietnam Airlines. The gap then didn't allow for 2.5 hours of flight change time. Trying to contact Vietnam airlines by phone is a futile effort. They are worse if not as bad as bargain airlines where it's impossible to get a hold of anyone by phone. Their automated phone system tells you to press X for English but nothing happens. It goes in a loop in Vietnamese. I then had to be creative and called up Singapore airport and asked to be transferred to Vietnam Airlines check in counter. Still didn't get a hold of anyone. Singapore then suggested I contact them via FB chat. So I did...oh my gosh, let me tell you, if I can gouge my eyes out it would have been less painful. Their English is so poor they cannot understand my concern. They kept insisting (for over an hour) that the flight time didn't change even after I sent them screen shots after screen shots of email confirmation and email notification of change time. Why did you send me a notice of time change of flight if the time didn't change?! But they kept insisting they are right. At the end (after 2.5/3 hours of chatting) they realized they did change the time. And the answer for that was - we are sorry for the inconvenience.  That's it? No offer to cover the cost of our new flight booking in order to connect to their flight, clearly all their fault. Unbelievable! Anyway, as far as business class goes, this airline is poor. The seats, while typical business class cabin, are old, dirty and need new upholstery. There are hardly any nooks and crannies to put away your stuff. Flight attendants are friendly enough but they hardly spoke English. They need to train their staff better if they want to be a global airline. Lounges are sub-par. You get better foods at the restaurants in the airport and seating much cleaner outside the lounges (in Vietnam). Stains on their seats and chairs and tables not cleaned on a timely basis. Disgusting. Never again."

It seems a shame that Vietnam Airlines continues to shoot itself in the foot, instead of improving. My trip from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City was afflicted by the same problems as in past 6 years. The safety announcement prior to take off was almost inaudible and beyond comprehension. I brought this to the attention of the senior cabin attendant in economy who didn’t seem concerned. Even the video presentation had errors with the actor in the life-vest demonstration blowing across the inflation tubes, not into them. The food served about an hour after departure was okay, not special. Soon after the trays were cleared away we entered an area of quite strong turbulence. The seat belt sign was illuminated and an almost inaudible message alerted passengers, but then the sign stayed on for almost 3 hours after the turbulence had ceased. Naturally, passengers ignored the sign and went about the cabin and to the toilets with no concern from the cabin attendants. As has been the case for years, the in-flight entertainment leaves a lot to be desired, especially when compared to similar carriers. Choices are extremely limited, while the secondary control on the top of the seat armrest repeatedly changes the volume, turns your reading light on or calls the cabin attendant if your rest your arm on it. A serious design error approved by Vietnam Airlines. The pre-landing snack was a beef pie. Mine was cold, and I asked the senior attendant for a hot one. She said nothing, took the tray and disappeared. Soon after, the food server in the other aisle saw that I had no meal and gave me a hot pie. After another 5 minutes the senior came back with my original pie. Is this the best VNA can do with cabin service? Oh, and like every VNA flight I’ve taken in the past 6 years, the unsmiling cabin crew seem to regard their job as boring and a grudging effort. VNA has the potential to be among the top international carriers in the world, but it will take a total attitude turnaround of senior management to achieve this."

✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Business,Premium Economy,Hanoi to Paris,June 2019,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,4,yes,9," This is my third time flying between Hanoi and Paris with Vietnam Airlines using premium economy. Check-in was very fast thanks to Sky Priority (Premium Economy guests have Sky Priority benefit during check-in, boarding and baggage claim). The staff at the counter was really responsible. She instructed me all what I need to do as I need to transfer in Paris. Nothing to complain here. Clearing the border control and security check was slow as the airport was over-crowded, and no Sky Priority this time. The seat was very comfortable and convenient. Even though it could not be made like a flatbed, it was enough for me to sleep well. Legroom was very very generous, as this should not be a problem for this class. The seat was just 45cm wide, a little bit small. Two meals were served on this 12-hour flight. I chose to have a seafood meal, even though I do not have any problems with any kinds of food. In general, I was satisfied with both the quantity and the quality of the food. The things I love most is the huge diversity of drinks: Lots of soft drinks, juice, milk and even wines were offered. However, extra non-meal food was bad. As stated in the menu, instant noodles and sandwiches could be ordered at all time, but I failed to order sandwiches. As for in-flight entertainment, since I am Vietnamese, I really enjoy their programs, and I found that Vietnam Airlines really try their best to put the newest and hottest movies on their entertainment. However, another issue happened with the headphone. The in-flight headphones were very old, they have been used for quite lots of years. Also, in my seat, the headphone could not be strictly plugged into the socket, which was really annoying. Flight attendants are helpful and friendly, but I found that they were really tired. Announcements were well played, in three languages (Vietnamese, English and French). This time I think that they spoke really well. In general, I think Vietnam Airlines managed to satisfy all the requirements for a long-haul flight. They also succeeded to make it worth paying extra for Premium Economy. However, in order to be 5-star, they need to improve a lot on the facilities, food as well as in-flight entertainment."

This time, the check-in was very quick since I have Sky Priority pass. However, it took around 30 mins to clear the security check. This flight was delayed for 15 minutes (due to prior late arrival), but the announcement was clear. This did not bring me any troubles, and I have not seen any serious (at least 20 mins) delays from Vietnam Airlines even though SGN is over crowded. The on board services were excellent, Hot meal was offered as the flight was at noon. Attendants were very friendly, I asked for another hot meal and they accepted! Sadly, the public screen was used to show the inflight safety instruction, it would have been better if it shown the position of the aircraft during the whole flight.

We mentioned that we had bought two extra flights with the airline and managed to check in online for our flight back to London with no mention of a fee. The airline staff insisted we had to pay a fee or not fly so we said we’d pay. The rerouting fee was over £200 each! We had no choice but to pay an extra £400+ because we wanted to get home.

Going for a personal trip with Vietnam Airlines last week, I had good expectations because of there membership of the Skyteam alliance. However, from the booking onward, they continued to disappoint. First of all the customer service was not able to understand my straightforward question in English, and I eventually gave up.  The plane was a new A350, so that looked good and the seat was comfortable. However, the inflight entertainment is the worst I have seen in the last 10 years. Very limited amount of movies, but the worst of all is that they played Advertisements the almost the whole flight - you just cannot believe it. Also, while having your own screen, they put on a 'candid camera show' for all screens, for over half an hour. Absolutely terrible, this is so far below par. Cabin crew was friendly, but just incompetent. Poor English, ignoring call-signs throughout. Terrible experience on almost all levels and disappointing for Skyteam. Many improvements needed! Hope they do something about it, because they do have the potential with the new planes (that's why I give 2/10)! "

They cancelled my initial departure 4 weeks before I was to fly. However, that gave me clear notice and chance to rearrange their now proposed late Saturday night departure. I decided to prepone my entire trip to arrive 2 days earlier from abroad. They promptly changed free of charge and apologized deeply. I checked in online for the first time with VN. Physically, allowed to check-in 5 hours early. In SGN airport, everything functioned well: I was granted priority at all steps from check-in, security, and boarding. Their Lotus lounge in Saigon domestic is modernized, good and spacious but food and drinks are poor. Only 2 beers offered and local, cheap “redwine”. Onboard, the business cabin has classic, huge, well bolstered business class seats in 2 x 2 configuration (where economy has 3 x 3). No entertainment. Poor food, but nice, wide range of beers offered. Mileage given. 2 pieces of luggage were well handled, though 30 kg in business is a too small allowance. The weight of suitcases were well over maximum, but not a word against it! 2 pieces of luggage received as the first ones when landed in Hue. Gate changes and slight delay. Bus-gating in both ends really destroy any feeling of exclusivity. Business Class must wait longer as they are only provided 1 trip small bus which not leaves before all business class passengers have entered the bus. Thus, economy passengers wait less as they leave whenever a bus if full. Air bridge boarding and disembarking should apply instead of bus-rides! Twenty minutes delayed. Otherwise, the reliability and communication are fine and timely. Stressless and genuine airline!"

Unable to use kiosk at airport. Very long check-in queue which we had to join despite having no check-in bags. No online or kiosk check-in means no bag drop. Seven counters for all VN flights leaving that day.  The fare allowed seat selection at time of purchase, but almost all seats blocked off. Managed to get an emergency exit seat, however, it appears anyone can sit in the emergency exit rows, and the ones on the other side were occupied by passengers who piled bags and coats in the row. The cabin crew were unfriendly almost to the point of rudeness and allowed people to hang off seats, block the aisles, general chaos. Gate changed at last minute without announcement. Water dispensed once in a half-filled cup. Beer on the outbound flight at room temperature. This is not a cheap fare and it would have been pleasant to have anything to drink on a 3+ hour flight. No air bridges at all despite the air bridge being extended to within six feet of the plane. Rear stairs provided but no crew at door to admit passengers. Uncomfortable seats. I have flown this route on other airlines and VN are to be avoided in future. What an unpleasant experience."

First flight of the new year, first time on the A350, first time flying to Vietnam and the first time flying Vietnam Airlines. My plane was only a year old, and though I was flying economy, I was very impressed with the leg room and the larger than usual display screens. I had middle seat 35H. In addition having only 3 seats in the middle as opposed to my last overseas trip with Hawaiian Airlines having 4 in the middle, made a big difference not cramming in people. My biggest strengths were with the aircraft itself, very quiet and brand new, not so much the airline, although lunch was pretty decent. I had two main meal options and chose the stir fried beef with black pepper sauce and steamed rice or Malaysian stir fried chicken with kway teow noodles complimented with a dinner roll and delicious ginger bread cake. We pushed back on time and departed quickly too. The crew though weren't really friendly, which was a shame. Also there wasn't much of a movie selection onboard either.

Due to a severe tropical storm (which they must have known about, before we left Hanoi), we were forced to land for a refuelling stop at Cam Rang. On that flight, we were offered a drink of water and a snack. As the initial flight duration was extended, nothing further was offered. We took off again for HCM. We were told to prepare for landing, which seemed to take a very long time, only to be told that we were heading back to Can Ramh. The cabin crew continued to sit at the back of the aircraft, offering no food, or drink. Having left at 14.00, we landed at said airport at 10.30 pm! Once we left the aircraft, we were given no voucher for food, no real information and no offer of accommodation. Only when I became unwell, was I told that our flight had now been cancelled and would not leave until 7.00, the following morning. Eventually, someone turned up with blankets - no announcement - and a free for all ensued. The following morning saw me being told, by a friendly passenger, that my flight was being called and that I had to check-in again. Only then, did I discover that my luggage had been removed from the aircraft and had been held 'securely'. It was retrieved for me and I boarded my flight - still without the offer of food, or drink (although some bottles of water had been offered the previous evening, along with cold noodles). At no point was an apology offered. Despite me submitting a photo of my (replacement) boarding card and details of my flight from hell, I am still waiting for Vietnam Airlines to acknowledge that there has been an issue for which they need firstly to apologise and, secondly, to offer some form of compensation. In my opinion, Vietnam Airlines can, in no way, be considered four star!"

We have flown international (Paris - Hanoi) and domestic (4 domestic flights) with Vietnam Airlines. The Paris - Hanoi flight was fine and comfortable, lots of legroom, inflight entertainment, food and beverages. The domestic flights felt (A321) as if you were riding in a roller coaster. It seems as if the pilots don't care making strong descents, steep sideways turns etc. Every landing was hard. The staff are very friendly but also very young, inexperienced and speak poor English. The lack of communication and poor English doesn't really make you feel at home. We also had a short flight with Malaysian Airlines which was way more steady and stable. "

Singapore to Hanoi. Boarding was quick and efficient, as expected at Changi. Typical economy seats but more legroom than most airlines. Hot towels provided after take off, with a prompt bar service complete with a packet of nuts. There seems to be competition between airlines to reduce the size of tumblers provided. Meal service followed quickly, with a choice of two eastern meals. A nice touch was a photograph of the two meals offered for those not familiar with eastern food. Quality was good. Drinks were offered with the meal, and there was a wine top up run during the meal. This was my first experience of Vietnam Airlines, and I was generally impressed. It is worth noting that Vietnam have added a third toilet at the back of this stretched A320."

Using Optiontown, I could upgrade my ticket to business class at a very affordable price. Sadly, my flight departed early in the morning so there was no priority lane at the immigration area at the airport. I have flown with Vietnam Airlines for so many times, so I knew what to expect; nevertheless, this was the fist time I flew with them in business class on an A350. The aircraft was fresh and clean, but the staggered seat was not very great though compared to the herringbone ones on B787 or the newer A350. Menus for breakfast were distributed, but the breakfast itself didn't have many options. Meal quality was good enough. Throughout the flight, I could see the presence of cabin attendance quite frequently to check if passengers needed anything. In-flight entertainment was not very various and updated, as I had watched all the movies presented in the system a long time ago. Overall, it was a slightly better product than other airlines operating on the same route."

The A350-900 is the newest addition to Vietnam Airlines' fleet, however I prefer the seating arrangement on their 787-9. The seat was good and on par with premium airlines around the world. Catering is quite behind other top airlines in Asia, but I'm excited that they begin to offer local signature dishes. The ""hu tiu"" dish served on my flight was reasonably tasty. Cabin service was generally pleasant. The restroom by the business class section had no running water, so staff put a bucket of mineral water in the restroom for us to wash our hands. This is minor, but I'm surprised how this can happen on such new equipment."

Flight initially rescheduled 3 weeks earlier giving me stress to a vey narrow timed international connection onwards. However, it was a lucky day: we departed 20 min early from Hue and arrived 20 min early in SGN. Onboard, they now serve several soft drinks in economy – before only water was provided. Check-in took seconds. Additional luggage acceptred. They allowed me to take luggage onboard as I had narrow connection onwards (their fault!). Bus gating in both airports (embarking and disembarking) is not funny – an extremely humiliating cost-saving experience to endure to be stuffed  50 pax in a bus and then been drove around in blindness. They stuff their buses to maximum capacity and provide no information. Extremely humiliating. All the time that we gained in efficiency from origin and during flight was completely wasted in Saigon where we suffered endless taxiing, stops and unannounced waiting. I may take the train next time: much more dignity and priceworthy."

Legroom was nice. Equivalent to JetBlue in the USA. Entertainment was provided on the inflight ceiling video screens. To be honest, if Vietnam Airlines decided to retrofit the A321, it would be a great experience. Overall: 8/10.

They announced by email in the morning a delay of 1 hour, which was fine for me and somehow not surprising on a Saturday evening. Lotus lounge in Hanoi T1 is huge and very well arranged and catered. Enjoyed quick WiFi and had a shower in one of 3 neat shower-cabins. The flight was on the usual A321 with 4 rows of biz-class. We were 6 persons in that cabin and the caretaking was fine. Newspapers provided. As usual on domestic, the food makes no sense to me, but it is levelled out by the drinks offering inclusive of not less than 4 brands of beers.

I first traveled on this airline from Hanoi to Phnom Penh in 1984 and it was a shocker. But this year I have had 5 trips with this airline this year and as I could only find my ticket for one flight I will restrict my comments to this flight. Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh on one of Vietnam's A350-900, which is a great aircraft: better than the Boeing 787-9 although the latter is also good and Vietnam Airlines uses this aircraft as well. Smooth check-in, easy boarding and friendly cabin staff. Only downside was a pathetic snack that is not characteristic of Vietnam Airlines international flights. But the solution a Pho Bo at the airport before boarding and perhaps a Bia Saigon or Bia Hanoi. My only gripe is the difficulty in checking online for some sectors and fairly poor frequent flyer program."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh City to Sydney,May 2018,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,5,yes,8,"  A giant leap in 5 years It's been 5 years since I last flew with Vietnam Airlines and I was less than impressed back then. But a very good price and the convenience of direct flights had me back in a blue and gold Boeing 787 flying Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City and returning 8 days later. Others more talented have sung the praises of the 787 and its mostly true. There were noteworthy variations between the flight over and the return. It is these disparities that VNA needs to address if it is to progress in the airline rankings. Boarding in Sydney on a cool morning the cabin was uncomfortably hot and fully open air vents didn't help. Push back was almost 30 minutes after scheduled departure and take off almost 15 minutes later. An annoyance in my seat was the overhead reading light which continually turned on by itself. It wasn't until I began using the IFE that I discovered the remote control on the top of the seat armrest not only activated the light, but the crew call alert, and the stop/play/end on the IFE. If a passenger uses the armrest that has a control, they're going to have an eventful flight. The cabin crew call alert was heard every few minutes throughout the flight. It's set off accidentally so often, the crew ignore it. This design flaw requires rectification. Every pre-recorded cabin announcement was almost inaudible, as they have been on past VN flights. Announcements by the crew were audible and the flight deck announcements were too loud and a little distorted. Meals were quite good and tasty, and the cabin crew were more friendly than they have been in the past, although it seems there may be a rule that cabin crew are not allowed to smile. SGN back to SYD was quite a contrast. Boarding commenced 30 minute prior to departure and was well organised. Push back was close to scheduled departure and we were airborne without much delay. In-flight comfort kit was distributed along with a menu. Again, the armrest remote had the crew call alarm going off continually. Dinner was served about an hour after departure and was superb. I had the beef stroganoff which was delicious. Drink service was generous and the crew very attentive. Overall, the IFE choices are a marked improvement with fairly good choices of movies and TV programs - keeping in mind it is Vietnam Airlines and about 80% of passengers are Viets. Breakfast was also excellent and the crew very attentive. All cabin announcement could be clearly heard and understood and the toilets cleaned about every 30 minutes. The crew were far more ""passenger-focused"" on this flight and more friendly. There was quite a variance in the service standards between both flights and its these inconsistencies that VNA needs to rectify if they are to get the sought-after 5 star rating. In closing, the Vietnam Airlines product is a massive improvement in 5 years and one can only hope it continues. "

We were bused to the A350-900 which had operated the earlier Seoul-Hanoi flight  The crew were welcoming and attentive, the seat was comfortable. The flight took off about 15 mins late due to the delays in the processing of passengers at check in and security.. During the flight we were offered a small snack box which contained Vietnamese biscuits and a few savoury items a soft drink was offered shortly afterwards.No alcoholic drinks were available to economy class passengers on this flight. On long haul aircraft (A330,A350,B787) Vietnamese Airlines has a wide variety of new release movies ,TV shows and games on its IFE, however the they are not available on domestic flights. Instead a prank show was aired for all passengers during the flight he majority of passengers seemed to watch the moving map instead. The flight arrived 5 mins early into Ho Chi Minh City despite the late departure. The luggage arrived within 10 mins of the flight arriving at the gate."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Paris via Hanoi,April 2018,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1,no,1," Purchased an economy ticket Sydney-Paris return having flown with them on many trips, the last 2 trips really changed my mind to travel with them again. It took 36 hours travel time and 4 sectors Sydney-Saigon-Hanoi-Paris and 2 transfers Saigon and Hanoi where we were left to find our own way to the domestic airports where we had to get a visa to cross the road and no gate direction and the 2nd a shuttle where we weren’t told where to catch the bus. We were given meals that were lukewarm on their Dreamliners and no choice of food at all. One breakfast Hanoi-Paris full of Europeans a Chicken dish with vegetables, bottled water was lukewarm throughout the trip. On the return flight we have a stop over of 15 hours where we were denied the transit tour and not even provided meals."

Flight punctual and check-in in Hue Airport took only 2 minutes. Lounge in HUI functions but is the most uninspiring lounge I have been to. IFE on board is a torture of forced showing crazy gags. Only 2 rows in Business class which make the cabin feel very cramped, despite seats being huge. The lunch served was completely a joke with 3 cold, freezing micro-sandwiches on white, soaked bread. What an embarrasment to the Vietnamese cuisine. Drinks better, e.g. they offer 4 brands of beer onboard. Tedious bus-gating in both airports - separate bus for business class. Luggage quickly delivered."

They had announced me earlier about ½ hour postponed schedule which forced me to change my flight to the next day. After some mistakes on their side I got the flight I wanted free of extra charges, but had to stay-over a night in Saigon. Check-in took some time due to queue but the security at Domestic took 30 Minutes to pass. Flight full, on time. I brought instant coffee bags and they served me hot coffee – otherwise catering is limited to Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and still water. IFE onboard is a torture of forced showing (common ceiling screens) of stupid gags with hidden camera. Very embarrassing for a 4-star airline to associate itself with such 3rd rates broadcastings. Bus-gating is very annoying, they pack their gate-transfer buses like sardine cans, so there is no space even if standing. In HUI its even more ridiculous as the airport is always idle but you are not allowed to walk the 2-300 meter from the airplane to the Terminal despite there is no other security issues. You have again to endure this tedious, lengthy, humiliating sardine packing just to create local employment. To pack the bus with 70 people takes 15 Minutes, to unpack it takes 5 Minutes, The drive itself takes 25 seconds. "

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787,Business,Premium Economy,Ho Chi Minh to London,March 2018,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,2.0,3,yes,6,"  Our first time flying direct to Vietnam from London with Vietnam Airlines. In general, it was just about our average expectation. Only a remarkable aspect was the Economy Deluxe, a good product indeed, affordable and very full. It is not a great value for business class unless you want to be in the sky for 13 hours non stop flight. We paid for both outgoing and return flights in business class but had to downgrade to premium economy seats for our return leg as no seats available in business class. It was fine and we were happy. One thing I do not understand when checking in at TSN airport, a senior ground staff did not give us invitation card to the business class lounge. I did make query but she insisted this is Vietnam Airlines' policy. If she is correct the airline must review their policy as we feel it inappropriate. We have been flying to Vietnam over 200 times for the last 25 years with more than 10 major airlines and this is the only unexpected experience if we do not want to say odd. We did have another issue on checking-in but no need to mention here as we may give it another chance to see this 4* (rated by Skytrax) to become 5* airline. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh City to Hong Kong,March 2018,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,2, Very poor from start to finish. Priority boarding was a mess with no signage and no adherence to recognizing codeshare programs and premium programs from the crews. Bus to the plane both in Ho Chi Minh and Hong Kong. The busses were packed and way beyond what was comfortable and safe at both airports. Get your act together Vietnam Airlines do you value you the customer or you want to be a budget airline as this is the experience you provided. All other airlines using you as codeshare should be ashamed as your service was below what I will find in a budget airline. And no entertainment in seats.

Vietnam airlines re-confirmed by email that everything is in good order. When I checked in at the hotel, the hotel said they had no business with Vietnam Airlines and there was no room available. They moved me to another hotel which was very dirty.  The business class seat was mal-function. You cannot adjust the headrest. The food was so so. They served champagne, but it ran out. Recently, Vietnam Airlines has a new lounge which has no longer served instant PHO, which is a big improvement. However, their helpdesk is horrible. They avoided answering the issue over and over again by apologizing and asking the customer to be ""sympathized"". If you will book a holiday package which includes hotel with VNA, please re-consider."

Even cheap tickets are changeable for modest fees. Travelled 3 trips recently on their A321 SGN-HUI-SGN-HUI-SGN. Saigon check-in is a bit messy, always long queues at security. Bus-gating in overloaded busses is a hassle. No real service onboard but the airline is punctual and got reliable flights and has a very fast check-ins plus a generous luggage allowance – all this count strongly for VN. You even get mileage and their business class is affordable if you like to drink beers with snacks in huge, spacious seats. They are boring due to lack of colours and design - but punctual. The drinking water provision onboard is now extended to Cola and Sprite. Bring coffee bags and they’ll provide hot instant coffee/tea. Worse is the lengthy and remote gating in Saigon which makes me close to miss flight connections. Small delays covered up by stupid, nonsense excuses like “due to late arrival of aircraft”."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to Singapore,February 2018,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1," Flew Vietnam Airlines from Hanoi to Singapore. Appalling customer service following big (6.5 hour) delays. Really disappointed with the service and totally inadequate response to my complaint. Our flight was diverted to Kuala Lumpur - admittedly through no fault of the airline, but this was announced through a cursory, garbled message from the air steward with no reason given apart from 'the airport is busy'. No further information was provided or reassurance given to passengers until the flight landed, when we were informed of the air temperature, local time and welcomed to KL. And then told we should not leave our seats as they would refuel and let us know our new departure time. After nearly two hours on the tarmac (during which time the only information I could get was by text from a friend watching the news in Singapore), we were herded off the plane and into a waiting area (without toilets, food or drink - though we can queue to leave the lounge, through security to get to a toilet). After 2.5 hours we were given a little pot of orange juice and some cake. Nearly 3.5 hours on we still had no news and not a single member of staff was in sight, no further food, water, or anything else was available. After four hours there was finally a curt call for “business class, children”. From this I deduced that perhaps the flight would be departing and asked the lady making the announcement who said we would hopefully be leaving at 8pm (approximately 4.5 hours after our scheduled departure time). I suggested to her that it might be worth making an announcement to let others know this. Back aboard the plane, we were finally provided with a bottle of water each at 19.50 (4.5 hours after the situation began) and a small box of chips each. At 8.05 we were welcomed aboard, and finally, at 8.10, the plane started taxiing, but of course, once we landed things still weren’t ready and we did not disembark until 9.45, 6.5 hours after the problems began and with very little apology or attempt to help in any of that time."

So we did not make our first flight. The manager saved us spots on the next flight no charge. But when we got to Terminal 1 they did not have seats saved for us. The gentleman there asked us to come back, if he could not get us on the 6:30 flight he would get us on the 9:00 flight. A man of his word, he got us on the6:30 flight. To our booked rooms. Thank you so much for being kind and getting us on to the rest of our holiday. You all are first class. If you had not gone the extra mile, I’m not sure how the rest of the vacation would have went."

It has been a really long time since I flew with Vietnam Airlines although it’s my home country airline, I must say they have improved a lot. Their brand new 787's look very fresh and new. I really loved the way they served passengers casually. I was stunned with how they have a menu for econony passengers, I did not expect this at all. They did a great job with cleaning the cabin. The crew were active and always walked around the cabin doing checks. They did not sit in their seats and play with their phones like when I last flew with them. Overall I think it was a great flight, they have really improved."

You get a dedicated line, more baggage allowance and lounge pass plus express through security. However you board the same bus as economy and board together, and the bus trip was way past domestic, across active runways to a back parking lot for planes. You get a drink in a glass. That’s it,  not great value for business and not worth it. Fortunately it’s just a short flight."

Cabin staff were excellent, prompt and willing. Any request was dealt with within a minute or two. Made more difficult for the cabin crew as we were travelling with 5 children who were always wanting soft drinks etc. Champagne prior to takeoff as standard, as much as you like. Food and beverage plentiful and tasty, wine refilled during meal numerous times, decent range on menu too. Seat comfortable but not the best for sleeping (I'm 6'3""). IFE limited so I took MacBook and watched own movies etc. Special thanks to cabin crew as they were the best of all 4 sectors of our holiday (Sydney to Paris return). This flight was well worth it. "

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Hanoi,January 2018,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  London to Hanoi. Vietnam Airlines lost my bag which was not a big deal but the handling of its recovery was the worst service I have ever received. They  lost my bag on 5th January then found my bag 10 days later, then couldn’t find it again, then it was being sent to Vietnam, then I was told I would be compensated fully if 21 days passed as the bag would be declared lost, finally after hours (no exaggeration) of trying to get service they acted and got me my bag after 16 days. $30 is the height of monetary compensation which barely covers phone credit in the many attempts at trying to get through to their lost and found never mind clothes, a new luggage bag etc. They rarely make contact and are impossible to get in contact with. They did not make contact after I logged my claim at 5am on the 5th January or 6th January and I had to call them on the 7th. When my bag was “found” in London I made contact 3 days later wondering where it was only to be told they did not know and it could be in Dublin."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Economy Class,Hue to Ho Chi Minh City ,January 2018,5.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,,5.0,5,yes,9," Went 10th January 2018, HUI-SGN on their A321. Perfect travel. They had changed the ticket for me few days before swiftly and at very low costs. Furthermore, I purchased online 10 kg extra, so I could travel with 34 kg. Check-in in Phu Bai took only the usual 1 minute. As I had a tight, international connection in SGN (with other alliance and on other ticket), they granted me Express Luggage tags to make it easier to reach the International Terminal in SGN quickly. Given the best seat onboard even without mentioning it to the (seat 18C). Flight left 10 Minutes early and arrived 20 Minutes early. Airbridge in Saigon. Luggage out (2 bags) within 3 Minutes. On-board: chatted a bit with air-hostesses, they were very kind, though more curious than informative. Brought along coffee-sachets and they then provided me hot instant coffee, while they otherwise only offer water and wet tissues. Very effective, good atmosphere, caring, punctual, and economical. I have recently lost all interest to the LCC competitors on this route. Drawback is, that the business sector has been reduced from 16, then 12, and now only 8 seats squeezed in upfront (in a 2 x 2 config), which makes business travel ridiculous."

Great meal considering duration of flight with choice between 3 main courses. Welcome drink including sparkling wine (not of the best quality though). Good seats (fishbone style sleeper seats). Offered a blanket (not available at every seat). Large screen entertainment. Boarded Business, Sky Priority and coach all together though it was not as disruptive as previous time thanks to dual jet bridge. No pillow. Limited drink selection (only 1 red wine).  Availability of in-flight entertainment starts fairly late into climb and limited movie choices. Power outlet not active until higher altitude reached (USB power works all the time). With the larger plane comes enhanced experience. Past 4 flights on A321 were average at best but this trip provided a better experience. I would not recommend the airline."

Booked 5 months in advance as there were some extremely cheap “super deals” around X-mas 2017 for around 25 USD per person 1-way. 3½ months prior to departure they informed me on slight changes of schedules and suggested me a reschedule 2 hours earlier. Instead, I asked them to postpone my flight till next day as to better match my connecting flight from SGN. They did that promptly and free of charge - including for my son. These tickets stood at a much higher price, but they gave us two seats without any question and I got a perfect connection time and thus avoided a stay-over in Saigon and still paid only 50 USD for the original two tickets. Well done, top notch ground service. The trips were fine, a slight delay was clearly announced and was caught up with as the scheduled time is set very amble allowing for hiding delays. Eventless trip. Generous luggage allowance but needed to purchase extra luggage in advance, which went smoothly. Check in took 1-2 minutes in both airports, extremely well done. Coffee on board gladly provided after given FAs instant coffee bags to add hot water into mugs provided by the airline. Seated with my son without having to ask for it."

Business class could be separated from economy class boarding by different buses. There are 12 seats in business class of A321. When I went to toilet, I had to wake the man next to me up due to the small space of leg. There are no PTVs all the cabin, so it is boring for a 4 hours flight.

Even though Da Lat airport is small, there is Sky Priority checkin and Sky Priority security line. There is no online check in on flights from Da Lat and they announced check in closure 45 min before flight. Boarding was a zoo and Sky Priority not respected. We could not select our seats again but got luckier this time (Row 11 instead of 33).Service limited to a bottle of water and wet towels. The seats are really hard. Limited English spoken by some crew members. Entertainment limited to central screen playing prank videos but no port to connect headsets. VN offers very inconsistent level of services. "

Gave us access to the lounge when she noticed we were flying internationally the next day. The bad: Started boarding regular coach pax before business/Sky Priority. Then when an agent opened our lane, our BP scan was done in between the regular pax lane scans (only 1 scanner). Online check in, even with our FF# recorded, did not give access to Priority seats. Needed check in at airport (no answer why). Could only select seats Rows 32+. Service limited to a bottle of water. No entertainment (show the flight info on ceiling screens). On that A321 version VN has a row of seat partially obstructing the exit doors (photo). Never seen that before. "

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-9,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Bangkok to London via Hanoi,December 2017,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,2,no,3,"  London to Bangkok return via Hanoi with my partner. Premium Economy was disappointing overall, based on the extra cost, comfort and service. The seats are nicely wider than in economy, with plenty of arm room, and there is plenty of leg room. Leg comfort is not great though. There is a flip up leg rest which only covers half of your calf. Beyond that there are foot rests attached to the seat in front, but you can't reach them with average length legs. We assumed that they are there just to stop you sliding down when fully reclined and asleep. It leaves you with aching calfs after a while. The seats are 2-3-2. If you get put in the middle of the ""3"" you can't get out if the people in front are fully reclined without making your neighbours fully put away their screen and tray. You certainly have to wake your neighbour to get up. The food was almost the same as economy. Pork or fish on the way out, and pork or chicken on the way back. Both with strange jelly like sweets - which we assume were Vietnamese. Cooked breakfast was sausage, egg and potato out, and bacon beans and egg on the return - better than the day/evening meals. Unusually for both of us we didn't finish any of the meals. Far from premium. Plastic cutlery out, metal on the return. I've eaten much better in economy with other airlines. IFE - all the movies had hard coded Vietnamese subtitles (can't remove). Headphones were the cheapest possible - out of two flights, two of ours had to be swapped for working ones. Uncomfortable and awful sounding. Again, cheapest possible. Staff on the outbound flight the attendants switched off the lights asap and sat in their area (between premium and business) and then disabled the call buttons. You can't call them, and you can't get up without waking your neighbour. My call button worked before lights out, and again when the next meal was served. Very naughty. Their general demeanour was pleasant, but often seemingly confused. On the return flight my partner's chair leg support would not work as the button was snapped off. This meant she could not sleep in comfort (try sleeping reclined with no leg support). The 1st attendant just said ""sorry"" and left. I then asked another for help and she brought a few pillows and blankets to try and prop her legs up. They just slid away after a short time. I pursued a solution. They offered nothing other than her moving to sit with someone else. Not great as I'd paid a premium (double eco) for a treat for us to fly together in comfort. I suggested they put her in business and I stayed put. Not a chance - no ""upgrade"" I was told (business was nowhere near full). I didn't want an ""upgrade"" - I wanted a working seat for her. In the end I slept in another seat next to a stranger and she used my seat. Totally unacceptable bearing in mind the only thing premium in their offering is the seat. Boarding passes printed on Economy stationary on our return flight, consequently no priority luggage marking either. Overall , other than the seats the experience is very ""economy"". Cheap in every way. Certainly not worth double the price of economy."

Both legs served by Dreamliner. Service on the first leg was poor, selection of the meal/drinks very limited. I suspect, same as in economy and served with plastic cutlery. Between the meals the cabin crew were completely gone and did not come back even if I repeatedly used the Attendant button on my IFE. They were clearly more excited to talk in the galley rather then serving passengers. On long flights there is usually also some snacks available in the galley between dinner and breakfast. This was a 9 hour flight, but no snacks available. Limited selection of non exciting movies to watch make the flight a very boring experience. Oddly enough, there were also some documents on Vietnam (Saigon), but with Vietnamese audio only. Hanoi SkyTeam business lounge is nowhere close to that in Ho Chi Minh. The second leg to Frankfurt was significantly better (ex. IFE). Flight attendants were efficient, helpful and customer oriented. Premium Economy cabin of Dreamliner is very nice, configured 2+3+2 with comfortable seats and sufficient leg room. However, if the person in front fully reclines it is difficult to get out from the window seat. IFE technically perfect with a big screen, providing VN would download good content. I found the service being largely inconsistent and clearly under performing against 4 star Premium Economy standard. Based on my experience, I would not choose Vietnam Airlines again."

But when I check in at Hanoi I only got 1 boarding pass, not get the boarding pass from HCMC to CGK. When we arrive in HCMC its 11.30 pm and the flight from HCMC to Jakarta will be in the next day at 9 am, so we can’t go outside for book the hotel because I can’t pass the immigration. In the international terminal in Ho Chi Minh City they dont have any facility for baby before we passed the immigration, so spent all night in front the check in counter.  I regret using Vietnam Airlines. This is will be the last time I use them."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Kansai via Ho Chi Minh City,November 2017,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,4,yes,7,"  Singapore to Kansai via Ho Chi Minh City. The first-leg (A320) from SIN to SGN had a slight delay of 15 minutes. Vietnam Airlines operates from the new Changi Airport Terminal 4 and uses a common lounge, which is reasonably comfortable and decent selection of food. For A320 the seat configuration is 2x2 with good and wide seat pitch, although without any IFE expected for a A320. Comfortable enough for a less than 2hr flight with dinner served. Flight attendants were efficient in general but communications generally lacking. For SGN - KIX (A350), able to use the Lotus lounge at Ho Chi Minh airport. However while the food selection is great (especially the beef pho), the scheduling of most departure VN flights at the same time (late night) means the lounge is fully packed like a market, almost war-zone like. Was offered access to another lounge but it's like 10-15mins walk away at the other end of terminal. Nonetheless staff is helpful in finding seats but first time experiencing a 'market-like' lounge. Business cabin is configured the standard 1x2x1 with fully reclined seat-bed and provided with an amenity kit, the cabin is bright and clean but not really aesthetically designed but more functional purpose. Seat and legroom is comfortable but perhaps some might find it tight if they are on the plus size side. IFE Screen is huge but browsing through the content it's quite limited in movies or any latest blockbusters. Flight attendant (japanese i guess? speaking in good english to me while handing me a tieng-viet menu) communicates well with cheerful disposition. Takeoff as scheduled and the A350 is quite a pleasant and stable flight. Cabin dim soon thereafter. A main issue is probably on the inflight meal schedule which took place 2hr-2.5hr into the flight. Given it's a 5hr or so flight it makes more sense to serve breakfast just before landing instead of interrupting passengers' sleep in between flight. In general aside from the meal schedule the flight from SGN to KIX was pleasant and comfortable. Flight attendants generally efficient but compared to SQ, CX or even TG the more personalized and enthusiasm is lacking. After landing saw this fellow passenger at the centre backrow (business cabin) splitting phlegm onto the floor and there's no response from the attendants. Presumably giving a benefit of doubt the splitting is into the sickness bag or something but i could see the 2 passengers in front of him feeling disgusted. Would consider flying again with VN all in all with expectations managed (not really sure the baseline for a 4 star airline), but more value definitely on the new A350/B787 aircraft"

I’m really pleased to see that Vietnam Airlines business is improving. Dreamliner flat beds, great staff, entertainment still a bit naff but we live in the age of iPads and downloadable Netflix so that’s not an issue. Food really good this time. Only complaint is the lounge at Ho Chi Minh where they sell space - leading to bad overcrowding. Air con was not effective in lounge either - it was much cooler in the terminal. Lounge food horrible.

My partner, a friend and myself booked a flight from Bangkok to Phu Quoc. We arrived at Bangkok airport to check in. 2 French and 1 irish staying 8 days in Vietnam. The lady took for ever to check our bags. We saw her going over to colleagues carrying our passport. We didn't know what was happening. But after few minutes she came back without saying anything. We asked: ""Is everything ok?"" Thinking that was weird that she had to go to talk to other colleagues with our passport. Anyway, she gave us our boarding pass saying everything was ok. Then we landed in Vietnam thinking the service was good on the plane. My French friend and I went through the custom with no problem but when my Irish partner presented his passport, it seemed that something was wrong. Being on the other side of the gate and not knowing what was happening was very frustrating. But then when I got to talk to him, he said that apparently he needed a visa. Visa on arrival were not to be given so he was in very big trouble because it was illegal for him to even be in the country!! The nightmare started. We had 1h50 to collect our luggage, register and check in again to take the second flight towards Phu Quoc. He had many many talks with airline agent, immigration officers, agent, at this stage we missed or flight. We tried to register online to apply for a visa which cost us 52USD - for nothing because apparently the office was closed - and then, after few hours he filled out some forms and paid an other 160usd to finally around 7.30pm get through the custom. How can the Vietnam airline agent not Know, tell us, inform us or say anything about the visa? Why did they let us take the plane knowing that it was not even meant to be possible to get a visa on arrival? Luckily enough we were not sent on deportation for the night and back to our departure point like it happened to an other couple, but what if? Thinking we were paying a little more to have a very nice time, we have been disgusted by the situation. I would not recommend to fly with Vietnam Airliness to anyone who are not very knowledgeable about visas. We lost one full day of our holiday, stressing out and sleeping on a chair at the airport, a night at the backpacker on the island pre-paid, 200usd for a visa which is meant to cost 12usd if you are aware and 150€ by 3person for the flights!"

New CIP Lounge they offer in Hanoi is excellent in all aspects and better than many international lounges. Nice panorama view, good food, many hot dishes offered, good workspace, and spacious environment. Food offering on board is poor: 2 cold, western open sandwiches are totally inedible to me. It has been the same ridiculous sandwiches on this route for 10 years. Drinks offering better including four beer brands offered. Not much innovation on this airline, but punctuality and effectiveness weighs more to me as the alternative LCC’s operating these routes are in high risk of irregularity."

Everything else was not. The flight attendants were not as mannered and well-trained as those of some other airlines. I wonder why they allowed the Vietnamese passengers to take out the food they brought from outside and eat aboard. Many stood up, walked out of their seats and grouped together in other area to talk and eat noisily. When they finished, they irresponsibly left a lot of garbage there and went back to their seats. Many Vietnamese passengers didn't care about the belt-fastening symbol that was lit, so they stood up and either talked or picked their stuff from above their heads. They didn't care about their safety? No flight attendants came to tell them to stop doing that. They just walked past them. The aircraft was quite noisy when the Vietnamese weren't asleep."

Check-in quick and smooth. No additional value of online check-in if one has to drop luggage anyway. Purchased on-line “prepaid additional luggage” 20 hours prior to departure and it cost me only 10 USD instead of 40 USD if paid at the counter. No IFE but flight info was displayed on small, shared, ceiling screens. Gate-changes. No airbridge provided in any of the two airports. I don’t like boarding by bussing around in airport during bad weather and rains. Good information from crew. FA’s have nothing to do onboard as there is no service and should be reduced in numbers. No meal or snack given on board – but FAs were having meals in their kitchenette. Luggage delivered on the belt at arrival quickly – some 5 Minutes time. Good value for money, some 45 USD in total as purchased during campaigns. That includes 20 kg inscribed luggage plus hand-luggage. Eventless journey, boring, but Vietnam Airlines is a reliable airline. At times very cheap."

Arrived 2 hours early on a Sunday morning. Flight got cancelled due to persistent typhoon outside and heavy rains and flooding. Waited for next flight and next flight but also cancelled - eventually the airport was shut down and I and other passengers were taken back to town by a bus. Had to find own accommodation. They then send me an email in the afternoon where they have rescheduled me on a new, inserted extra flight on 6th November (the following day). All passengers for the day were stranded. I then had big problems with onwards flights as I would not able to show up in Saigon even on the same day. Vietnam Airlines tried to help me but were not professional enough to sort it out and failed. Instead, I managed to solve it myself by postponing the next connection by two days to be sure to catch the planes in SGN. As for VN, I then came to Phu Bay airport the next day and they instantly checked me in on the extra flight. I was offered to go on an earlier flight at check-in counter, they would inquire as people were still checking in. Later in the lounge they provided me another boarding pass for the earlier flight. Very convenient as there is nothing to do in Phu Bai airport lounge as it is boring and and service deteriorates. No beer, no fresh coffee, no toner in the printer, no hot food. What a shame for a 4-star airline. The brewery is located only one km away and sells 4 cans of beer for 1 USD – much cheaper than all the soft drinks and milk offered in the lounge. The flight followed schedule. Food on board ridiculous, three micro-sandwiches which go in one single mouthful, but its not worth eating. Drinks better (e.g. 4 brands of beers offered) and FAs very alert. Only 2 rows of 4 seats makes business class feeling cramped despite good seats. Bus-gating in both airports with special business class shuttle. Luggage smoothly handled and arrived in few Minutes. Its not yet a 4-star airline: fairly good, but with significant faults. VN ground-staff handled the typhoon issue to a tolerable level but could have done better and provided more options and accommodation to passengers. Should have send passengers to Danang Airport 80 km away but did not offer. Information provided extremely poor and were very slow to rebook or take any action."

We ended up leaving Sydney 24 hours earlier and the airline provided hotel, meals, transfers in SGN. Frustrating experience but it all worked out in the end. Checkin was quick and easy, but there was a slight to-do because we didn't have a Vietnam visa for our 24 hour stay (the airline sponsored us on arrival so we didn't have to pay for it). Was given an immigration express pass and bags priority tagged. Flight was about half full. Boarding was quick and easy. Seats are 2-3-2. Chose window/aisle 14AC towards the rear to avoid any toilet flushing/galley noise at the front. Don't think it was too bad though. Legroom is good, but if the person in front fully reclines it's difficult to get out from the window seat. Meals/drinks are the same as in economy. You just get served first. 2 melts were tasty, but don't like champagne from a plastic glass, or plastic cutlery. Cabin crew were polite, but otherwise unremarkable.

Ground staff hopeless and unfriendly. I travelled with some staff of my company. Where is the group check in?! The ground staff told me it is up to me where i want to check in. I said here and she said no. If a Gold member is being talked to in such a manner, i can only imagine the way foreign passengers are treated and even worse, local passengers are treated. I've so many trips in the south via Cam Ranh and Saigon, their people are so much more excellent. Lounge - what kind of standard is this. 3 staff at the front desk and I am not even greeted. Why is it that in Saigon I am greeted but not here? And why is the lounge so badly stocked?  Nothing to eat except some fruits? "

I am also very concerned as I am transferring from an international flight to a domestic flight which requires me to clear customs, collect my bags and then check in again. VN Airlines leave my schedule as is and advise that they will have staff on arrival to assist with my transfer. When I arrive VN airlines take almost 1 hour just to unload our luggage - The staff member on the ground who was supposed to assist is glued to her phone texting the entire time. Once we have our bags she leads us to the domestic terminal, tells us we've missed our flight, shrugs our shoulders and then walks off, forcing us to stay 1 night at an old, run-down hotel (couldn't even sleep due to the obscenely loud noises coming from the pipes in the walls) and forfeit the 1st night's accommodation at our destination. I've attempted to contact their customer service line for compensation for weeks now, as well as included all my supporting documentation (emails, boarding passes etc.). Each time I do their response is always words to the effect of ""someone will get back to you"", and then I never heard back. Completely disgusting."

Having had great experiences flying domestically with Vietnam airlines, and keen to try out the newish A350, we decided to use Vietnam Airlines for an international trip. When we bought our economy class tickets we visited the Optiontown website and paid NZ$259 each (USD160) for the chance to get upgraded to premium economy - and it worked! Standing in the check in queue I had given up hope but made one last check of my emails - and there was the good news. If we hadn't been upgraded our money would have been refunded. The great news was that we could use the priority security clearance queue - and the queue at CDG makes LA look easy. I reckon that it would have taken more than two hours just to clear security. The bad news was that we weren't entitled to use the business class lounge. Sure we had priority boarding - but who wants to sit on a plane any longer than they have to? And my suspicion that the hosties would not be greeting us with a glass of champagne (or even sparkling wine) turned out to be correct. The three things that stood out for me were the low quality of the Premium Economy experience, weird meal times and how dirty and badly maintained the seat was. The flight departed CDG at 2pm and they gave us dinner almost straight away. We then had to wait about nine hours for breakfast. They did offer us a filled roll sometime during the night. The meals were entirely forgettable and certainly no more than economy class standard. They were also very, very stingy with the drinks. The armrests of both our seats had accumulated dirt build-up - if you scraped it with your fingernail the layers of filth would come away (see photo). I have sat in similar premium economy seats so I know how the footrest works - or rather doesn't in this case. I noticed other people were having problems too. On the upside the seats had adjustable neckrests. Would I fly Vietnam Airlines again? Domestic flights absolutely - international is only a maybe."

Departed on time and arrived before time, VN are virtually always punctual. Onboard, comedy entertainment showed on ceiling screens are a nuisance to me. I brought instant coffee sachets with me and was then given hot coffee twice (they provide hot water and paper mugs upon request). The flight was completely full, but everything was well organised. Business class section is now reduced to only 8 seats in 2 rows. They use a airbridge gate (""apron"") in SGN, so disembarking and embarking goes quickly. Even then, luggage came out on the belt quickly after cabin doors were opened. In HUI they use bussgate which is a joke and waste of time and resources as the aircraft is always parked only 200 meters away from the Terminal building. A new innovation on their homepage is that they now display total fares from the start of booking, which is very transparent. Other airlines should follow, not at least the two LCC’s operating here in Vietnam where initial ticket fares of ""0 VND"" often ends up being more costly than those sold by Vietnam Airlines which is the only legacy carrier operating domestically. Ticket bought 2 months prior to first departure, altogether 85 USD for a return ticket with handluggage and 20+ kg luggage included. Miles credited Lotus FFP, though discounted tickets do not give much credit mileage."

Noodle soup: ask customers if they would like to have some (it should be systematic), because it is a favorite meal.

Moreover, the entertainment system were very good with several choices from game to music or films. I hope to fly again."

I recently chose to fly with Vietnam Airlines rather than Singapore Airlines  with whom I travel twice a year to London. Their Boeing 787 and 1-2-1 business seats are very good, whilst not as spacious as SQ's they are 'lie flat', comfortable and on all legs I managed to sleep. The service has improved greatly since I last flew with VN. The cabin staff were friendly and willing. In general their English was not to the level of the SQ staff but by pointing to what you required from the menu communication was no problem.  On all 4 legs the main courses chosen were disappointing and most were left unfinished. The wines on offer were of good quality however. Upon take-off you are asked for your menu choice including accompany drinks. If you don't make a point then your first drink will come together with your starter. They should ask prior to take off whether you would like a drink after take off. I will fly Vietnam Airlines again as the ticket price is well below that of SQ, especially if for holiday rather than business. On both legs I stopped over in HCMC, a city I know well. the only comment on flight times would be that the SGN-LHR flies at 1 am. A couple of hours earlier would be preferable as by the time you take off you are very tired."

The domestic portion to Nha Trang was complicated. 5 schedule changes since I bought my ticket. Just arrived to take my flight and told at the counter the flight was rescheduled again and told to come back later for check in. I'm actually fine with the time change, but the attitude of the check in agent has convinced me never to fly with them again. Her body language and tone made it clear it was my fault for showing up early and walked away when I asked a question on the new time for the flight. Have since asked 2 other airline employees for the new time and have been told 2 different answers. Flight not showing on the board and we are waiting."

They send an e mail that they changed the time 3 hours later just before I was leaving for the flight. I tried to get contact to change it but no lines were available and you have noone to talk about it and even after that they had another 1 hour delay with the new departure time. We still have no one to complain about it. In the end we arrived around 2 am instead of 10pm . I don't recommend this airline at all to anyone unless you like to be tortured with long delays.
✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,London to Hanoi,July 2017,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,3,no,5," Basic no frills business class tickets from London to Hanoi with Vietnam Airlines. Seating was comfortable but service lacking. Staff were polite but hidden from view after meal service. I gather there was a technical hitch with catering so it was frozen smoked salmon and basic canteen fayre no special culinary delights. On the return it was a single prawn with a few salad leaves for starters and limited choice. My main complaint was that you can't check in without flash player, which is very inconvenient when using iPad and due to a change in travel arrangements, we could not check the prices or availability of new tickets until after cancelling original return flights and waiting 4 days to find out about the new ticketing and price differences. After that we were unable to select seating and advised to wait till check in. Of course the booking reference was not recognised and so seat selection was deferred to check in at the desk. The main concern was that on the way out the 3 of us were allocated seats without any rhyme or reason. There is no opportunity to select any special meals seating or even rewards for a flying club. After changing tickets there was a concern the new booking would not be recognised. Inflight movies were dominated by Vietnamese movies 1950-60s 'classics'. Overall a very limited choice. Overall a very primitive airline - although competitively priced, however needless to say we won't be travelling with them again. Stick to EVA Air, Virgin, Singapore, Emirates, KLM and maybe Air France if no strikes."

Once we reached the security officer, he advised that Vietnam Airlines have changed some seating for online check in, therefore he could not find us in the system and sent us back to Vietnam Airlines counter to reprint the ticket. We ran to the counter and get our tickets reprinted, then headed back to security. We went to Departure gate where they said that we were late and could not let us in. Coming back to the courter to change ticket, we were told that they could not ensure the time of our flight and we might wait until 2.30pm that day.  I think Vietnam Airlines should train their staff better to deal with these kind of situations in a better manner. "

Attentive and efficient flight crew, good quality of meals with added some local delight and the latest A350 aircraft. I like their color theme of the seat. The aircraft was fascinating with larger screen and more leg room. The content selection was decent and more than enough throughout the flight. I was also on their A321 during my KUL to SGN. Although the aircraft looks bit old but well maintained and comfortable. They used three different language during flight announcement and it was not clear and blur. This was my first time fly with and I'm quite impressed with their product and services provided with that competitive price. "

A321. Both legs on time, check in extremely fast - even with lots of luggage. Generous with hand-luggage as well as inscribed luggage. Second flight accommodated a lot of extra luggage which was well handled and reasonably priced from Saigon. I easily postponed the first departure time by four days as something had incurred forcing me to change. Despite the ticket was cheap the change was done quickly and punishment fees not too bad. Eventless flights, but reliability and punctuality count heavily for using this airline. In contrast all the competing LCCs seem to have problems making their schedules."

I  was positively surprised over excellent ground service: I bought a cheap ""early bird"" ticket Ho Chi Minh City to Danang for approx. 37 USD. 3 weeks prior to departure they rescheduled and preponed the departure from 8 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. and informed me by email with a re-issued ticket attached. Since I was to arrive at the international terminal in Saigon with a tight connection time of 1½ hour, I immediately realised that I could hardly pass immigration, change terminal, retrieve luggage, and check in domestic within an hour. Thus, I preferred to go with another carrier. I explained them this on email. Despite it was a cheap, non-refundable ticket they understood and refunded me instantly the whole fare without further arguments. That is a proof of a legacy carrier, well done and thank you VN. Vietnam Airlines is eventually cheaper than the LCCs they are competing with due to punctuality, reliability, and decency."

A very slow check in that for some reason took four staff members. There was a VIP queue so security was efficient. The lounge is tragic at Danang with none of the food looking edible, we spent the time looking at the shops instead after having a water (there are no glasses provided either). Went to the gate when the flight was called business class boarded last so about 15 minutes before you could board after all the economy passengers were on board. Not enough catering so no food for me, I slept for the hour long flight. Crew were nice enough with the title interaction I had and the flight arrived on time but in general this looked like an airline that had made a lot of cuts, there were no frills and it was below the standard of most domestic economy products. Bags off quite quickly but all you could say was that they got you to your destination."

I chose Vietnam airlines because it is a direct flight to Sydney and its quite cheap. On the way to to Sydney I flew with economy class. The food on-board was great.  The in-flight entertainment was quite poor but it has some great movies. The way back was better because it was a premium economy so I can get more 10kg of luggage (40kg total) so I can carry all my shopping things without any extra fees. The seat in premium economy has plenty of legroom with bigger seat so you can rest easily. The food is no different to the normal economy. In total I think it was a great flight, I will travel with Vietnam Airlines again."
✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to London via Hanoi,December 2016,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,"  Singapore to London via Hanoi. My experience with this airline has been really positive, I found an incredibly cheap flight to London so I could visit my family for Christmas. My ticket cost me around £500 return (normally flights are double that or triple around the holidays!) The one drawback was that I had a six hour layover in Hanoi. My flight from Singapore was nice, we were served a light meal and coffee, a little turbulence, the staff were smiley and attentive. My one criticism is the landing was a bit harsh on all four flights and I don't like holding onto the plane for support. When I got to Hanoi I wasn't sure what to expect but I quickly discovered there was a first class lounge which I could use for $50 US I was happy with that for six hours and paid using my credit card. I had a lovely hot shower with towels and toiletries, it made the next flight so lovely and pleasant. I spent the rest of my time in the lounge watching a couple of movies on my laptop. There was a hot food buffet and even an open bar where I helped myself to a nice glass of brandy. By the time we boarded I was completely exhausted, it was 1am and I was ready to sleep. I was delighted to discover I had three whole seats to myself! I slept for 11 hours and woke up just in time for breakfast and a quick movie before touchdown, Christmas with my family and no jetlag! I also liked the fact that Vietnam Airlines lands in Heathrow Terminal four which is one of the least busy airports so passport control was short although I loved standing in line with a bunch of grumpy Brits, it really felt like home! On the way back we got stuck on the runway for about an hour but that was mostly down to Heathrow being busy, there was a technical problem they needed to fix and once everything was safe and in working order they had missed their 'window' to take off and had to wait for another. This time the flight was to Ho Chi Minh and the inflight entertainment was a bit rubbish but I watched a few movies and ate a nice dinner. The layover was short, only one hour and then a smooth, short flight to Singapore (apart from the harsh landing, ouch!) Overall a very positive experience, but I think given all the negative reviews I might have just gotten very very lucky!"
✅ Verified Review ,A320,Business,Business Class,SGN to HUE,April 2017,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,3.0,5,yes,6,"  Ho Chi Minh City to Hue. Very surly and slow check in first thing in the morning. There is a VIP queue through security (that isn't labelled business class by the way) but is a far better option than the pushing throngs that were in the main queue. Lounge clean and reasonable selection of food, Vietnamese coffee from the machine was good. Food was plentiful but nothing really appealed. On the plane the cabin was clean, seats comfortable. I assume that the same selection is used for domestic meals at any time of the day as after water or juice pre take off, meal once in the air was a plate of sad canapés for breakfast or for a special meal prawn salad, which was OK but nit really an early morning option. Water, juice, coffee, tea or beer were the options with the meal. Staff in the air obliging and very seemed young and somewhat lacking in confidence perhaps because English was not a strong point. Only just over an hour flight, landed on time, there is the last ""luxury"" touch of business class passengers getting their own bus to the terminal which is nice but the rest of the crowd will be with you by the time that the bags arrive however business bags were first. All up a pleasant domestic flight with in retrospect breakfast in the lounge being a much better option that in the air."

Going out was ok, not great but ok. I will comment on the return leg. The flight was scheduled for a 10.35am departure, the lounge screen showed boarding would start imminently so we left the lounge. The arriving aircraft was late so boarding didn't take place until 90 minutes late. Once onboard no announcements about when we would take off or apology, we waited 2.30hour to then be told that they had a problem with a cargo door being hit but would take off in 20 minutes. We didn't take off in 20 minutes, cabin crew then told us they would serve lunch. No further explaintion from the pilot or crew, eventually after 4 hours total we departed. The dessert came round after take off. I was offered one drink in 2 hours. The seat is good but the service is so poor, the cabin crew standard of English is mostly poor. On landing we had missed our connection. On landing we were told we were booked on the next flight tomorrow and would be out in a hotel overnight. We just joined a long line of economy passengers, I was told that I would need to leave our passports in the airport overnight with immigration, what an uncomfortable feeling. We were then told to collect the passports at 6.15 the following morning, we got the passports back and then were escorted to immigration. They wanted to know why we hadn't got visas, a senior Vietnam air officials assisted us but to be honest it was all very uncomfortable. I travel all over the world in business class and can honestly say that Vietnam Airlines should not be offering connecting flights until they have systems and staff in place who know how to manage delays. Service is average all the journey, move selection was one of the worst I have ever seen as it was so limited. I shall be back to Thai Airways again."

Should regretfully admit that this was not so. I know that our flight was based in Nha Trang, but the plane was not clean, as if it was a return flight. On the luggage racks lay garbage, the portholes were dirty, in the pocket of the seats was also garbage. There was also a lack of on-board service on domestic flights - only water is offered. As you can see, the onboard magazine is unpleasant to hold. I can not recommend, I will avoid the airline, including on long-haul flights.

Tried in vain to change to a later flight with vacant seat but was not allowed without paying penalty, despite my fare rules says “change without fees”. They offered me standby for free but that was a joke as I then would have to risk everything as I’d forsaked my earlier flight. Lounge in Danang used to be good but is now run down, dirty, no alcoholic drinks, staff washing dishes in front of service table. Lounge staff informed me that due to unwillingness from VN to increase their lounge-payments the operator has been forced to save. VN are now cutting costs seriously in their domestic business class. I was informed by lounge staff that that passengers consume 2+ cans of beer on average (this is in Vietnam 80 cents minus taxes!). VN refuse to pay that. The soft-drinks, which costs double as beers, are however available. But fruit juices have also gone. The flight was delayed ½ hour. Onboard the business seats are becoming very old. Instead of 4 rows in business there are now only 2 rows, and on a full plane it feels very cramped. Better travel economy seats, there is more space in general than with this squeezed configuration of 2 x 2 in 2 rows. They have shortened the distance to put in more seats on their A321! Shame on VN, for deteriorating their domestic business class; it used to be a very good option. Food is poor and menu has run for years (an attempt to serve “canapés” which are disgusting, tasteless, greasy, cold, and ugly. The drink service is OK (soft, beer, hot-drinks). Newspapers offered. Not more than a 3 star airline in terms of service."

Basically, no service on board, but I found a way to get myself coffee by bringing along instant coffee sachets, then they’ll find a paper mug and boiled water to make it for you. Good service and baggage allowance. Fairly faultless and predictable, but also, uninspiring, dusty, conservative, eventless, colourless, quiet as the grave, and boring.

It's a very good option for travelling between Vientiane and Paris with a relatively short and hassle-free stopover in Hanoi. The new A350 servicing the route is a nice aircraft with a great sense of spaciousness. The lie-flat seats are comfortable. The food and service are, in general, very good, especially the 'pho bo' breakfast option. The IFE is disappointing - a limited choice of movies with few new releases and very few TV programmes. Overall, I would recommend Vietnam Airlines and I will definitely fly with them again.

Chose Vietnam Airlines because of direct route and pricing. It's been 15yrs since I flew from UK to SE Asia direct (I usually fly Emirates via DXB) so I was apprehensive about the duration and about the airline, which I had not used before. The booking engine on their website is a little complicated in that you cannot book some classes of ticket oubound and a different class inbound (i.e. the very cheapest ones) but that was not too big a problem. Checked in online 24 hrs prior to departure and breezed through bag-drop at LHR - I was the only passenger at check-in, which was very efficient as was boarding. The aircraft was clean and neat and cabin staff polite and friendly. Economy seating is 3-4-3 and in an aisle seat I found plenty of legroom and it felt like considerably more width than say Emirates. I was perfectly comfortable throughout a 12-13hr flight Vietnam Airlines say they are aiming for 4 Star service and I would say they are pretty much reaching that. The food was generous and a reasonable variety. They are a bit stingy with alcohol though - as they insist in *pouring* your drinks - so rather than just handing over a minature of spirits and a can of mixer or a small bottle of wine (as most others do) you actually get 3/4 of a plastic cup of wine or 1/2 a minature of spirits and whatever amount of mixer they decide is going in! I'd rather have been given the ""goods"" and served myself. Service throughout the flight was fast and attentive with drinks, pot noodles, sandwiches, pretzels etc all freely available. The entertainment system was good rather than excellent but it satisfied me and the music selection made a change from modern stuff I've never heard of! Departures and landings were all on time. Loyalty program is hardly worth joining if you're flying at cheap fares as you get 0.25 points per mile so the chances of ever having enough points to do anything with is pretty remote. Also the ""Optiontown"" BC (possible) upgrades were unavailable so i didn't get a chance to try that - but you can't have everything I guess For £500 return I feel I got good value for money, will certainly fly with Vietnam Airlines again and in fact recommend them."

Moved out of airport, into hotel, checked in, issued dinner and breakfast vouchers, then an hour later, told the plane would be flying that night and to get packed up again to be taken back to the airport. No apologies on the flight. Choice and quality of food in Business poor. The lie flat bed had a gap at the lower back level, making it quite uncomfortable. Cabin staff had poor understanding of English and were not particularly helpful. On arrival at Hanoi, no help on the ground for many people who had missed their connecting flights. On the return flight to London, a wait of 1hr 40 mins for the baggage to be delivered. Again, no information until it arrived and that was apparently due to not being able to open the luggage hold and a wait for engineers. On the return flight, my personal entertainment would not work, they were not able to fix it and luckily there was another seat I could use. "

Thus, everything went smooth and I was neither penalised nor denied anything, despite I was very late. Further, this ticket was extremely cheap purchased months earlier during a campaign period.

However, the ground service at an information counter of Vietnam Airlines in Ho Chi Minh Airport was bad. I bought round trip tickets from Bangkok to London via Ho Chi Minh. On the way back to Bangkok, I didn't want to wait for a connecting flight for more than 10 hours at Ho Chi Minh airport, so I bought extra tickets with the other airline to Bangkok. Traveling a long flight, we were so tired, so I asked a staff for using a VN lounge. The staff rejected and insisted that only persons who fly with VN can use the lounge. I had a ticket but chose not to fly. The important thing is I paid for all the services why couldn't I use it. She strongly insisted on the VN regulation, without any empathy that we were so exhausted. I would suggest that VN train ground staff to have more hospitality and good service mind. I am so sorry for the Vietnam Airlines inflight staffs who worked so hard to provide excellent service onboard but the ground staff, obviously having been ignored by Vietnam Airlines in service mind training, destroyed the reputation of VN."

The staff were attentive throughout the flight and snacks (pot noodle and sandwiches) available in-between meals. The meals were more than acceptable and the portions good. The movie selection was quite limited in regard to major movies but if not a film buff were adequate. Transfer from International to Domestic terminal was about 5 minutes walk. ( You collect your bags at collection in the International terminal and hand them over just outside.) Getting through security at the Domestic terminal can take up to 40 minutes. Both flights took off on time and landed on time. Domestic flight seating ok but not great. Flight rather noisy with many young children and babies.

When I heard about Vietnam Airlines' new business class I wanted to try it out. After booking my flight from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi aboard an A350, Vietnam Airlines tells me that my flight has been cancelled and changed to a different aircraft. So, I changed my flight to a different one with an A350. But each time VNA kept on changing my flight. The day before my flight they once again changed my plane to an A330. On board the plane, the business class product was outdated and was simply a seat that could recline more than economy. The seat was not comfortable and service was average. The food was typical plane food and was not outstanding. If you are looking to fly business with VNA avoid their old planes and try to fly the 787 or 350 as the other planes are not worth the extra cash. The lounge in HCM was newly renovated and had good drink variety but a lack of food choices.

The Boeing 787 business class seat on Vietnam Airlines is good, however service is still maddening and erratic. Some FA clearly are wanting to be somewhere else rather than serving you, and mistakes are often made even when requests are written down. There is a degree of shambolic carelessness which spoils the service in almost every action, from being unable to understand the announcements to not knowing how to serve cheese, to forgetting drinks, or the order that food is served (and in piecemeal fashion). If you can overlook the ambivalent service then the food is tolerable (think somewhere between Y and J), the appalling wine selection and the friendliness dependant upon the FA in question. Announcements are minimal (suits me as I couldn't understand them anyway). IFE selection is poor, headsets are what you'd expect in economy class. At the end of the day it's a flat bed seat for cheap, so I guess I can't expect too much."

Big snow in Paris meant long delays. Check-in was quick and painless in the dedicated zone in Terminal 2E.Passport control) and PIF though were another story. Completely not ready to handle the crowd. It took at least 35 minutes to get your passport checked. Staff in Air France's Hall M lounge though were well equipped and well briefed. We were kept until the last minute before being asked to proceed to the boarding gate some 2 hours after the original departure time. Once on board, it took a further 1 hour to wait for ground handlers to push our aircraft back. The pilot kept us informed and cabin crew kept everyone's glasses full during the wait. Once in the air, they skipped the bar service since everyone was hungry after a 3.5 hours delay and the main meal was served. It was nothing special and nor was the breakfast served 90 minutes before landing in Saigon. Cabin crew were courteous and functional but no too friendly or warm. They got the job done efficiently though. Seats on the A350 turned into a flat bed but they have a different layout than the 787s. They are narrower with fewer leg space it seems. Good for a night sleep nonetheless. Toilets were not too tidy and lacking in amenities. IFE has very few programs but nowadays with a good book and movies on your tablet, it doesn't really matter. Flight at the end arrived with 2.5 hours delay but no-one was helping mis connecting passengers upon arrival in Saigon. A mad dash through security and a 30 minute delay of the connecting flight meant I got on mine no problem. The short hop to Hong Kong was just a normal commuter flight with a standard meal, very standard service and little amenities to write about."

But the check in service was horrible. After waiting in line the counter said we had to go to a different location as they only handled check in and not inquiries. We went to the Vietnam Airlines counter and the gentleman there said he would not look up our flight based on passport because it was too much work for him and that I had to dig out my reservation code. After all that he said we could book an earlier flight but we would be downgraded and forfeit the difference in price. The message was delivered with a smirk and absolutely no empathy. Disappointing.

Previously travelled on old A330s, old B777 and new A350. This trip was in Boeing 787's whichare new with lie flat seats. We like travelling on VN in business because the costs are half of what we'd be paying on the others such as Qantas, SIA etc. We checked in at the priority line in MEL and were through passport control quickly. We had breakfast in the Qantas business lounge. That was quite good. The flight left MEL on time It's a great feeling being able to turn left and head for the pointy end of the plane. I so dread economy! The new Boeing 787 was very nice. Food was very nice and service was fine. Only issue was the lack of decent music, TV shows and movies on the IFE. They need to look at this. Before we arrived we were offered a second meal. Not really required as I wasn't that hungry after the first meal. We landed safely in SGN and were met by the transit agent who got us through immigration and off to a nice four star hotel in the city. We declined the free city tour and meal but enjoyed a shower and rest in the hotel for 5 hours. That's the only real negative about flying Vietnam Airlines to Europe from Australia. The layovers are too long. Agent picked us up in the foyer of the hotel at the arranged time and got us back to the airport where we were through passport control and into the lounge in 15 minutes. Second flight to London Heathrow was also in a Boeing 787. Because it was now around midnight we were tired and slept most of the way. The lie flat seats were very good and much better than sitting in a cramped economy seat. I remember dreading the thought as I lay relaxed on my back! Before arrival in LHR we were served an adequate breakfast. Again the IFE options were lacking. "

They often were absent from the Economy sections for extended periods and it was almost impossible to get a second coffee or wine. Even water was difficult to get from them. Customer service in Vietnam is generally very good so it was a surprise to find this unfriendly aloof approach from the cabin staff. Probably wouldn't be my first choice in airlines.

,,Business,Business Class,SYD to LHR via SGN,December 2016,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,4,yes,4,"Sydney to London via Ho Chi Minh City. I've flown business class on Vietnam Airlines a number of times (6 trips in 12 months) and until they sort out staff training and airport facilities - and the stopover provisions when flying from London they will never be a credible option for business class travel. There is always a massive time deferential in the flights that stop at Ho Chi Minh - sometimes 12 or more hours wait for the continuing flight - yet the lounge at the international airport, now operated by Sasco, is uncomfortable, makeshift and cheap. A free transfer to a hotel is only provided one way from London, and not at all if you book directly with Vietnam, yet if you book via a travel agent in Sydney it's both ways. If you try and arrange a hotel through them it is insanely difficult, yet book from Germany and you can cheaply add a stopover to your flight. Some standardisation is required. Staff at check-in at Sydney airport are pretty good although for some reason assumed we were flying other than business - in the sky priority queue - and directed us to a woman who didn't have any of the bits and pieces required to check-in business passengers. Not a problem, expect that they made it seem as if we'd gone to the wrong counter. No apology. Attempted to use priority lane at SGN only to be told by clueless passport control that I had to be flying Vietnam Business. No apology when I pointed to the ticket in his hand and said I was. Sure customs aren't the airline - but this airline is state-owned. The female staff were rude when I attempted to enter the lounge using my Platinum lotus miles card - my fault as I assumed once you reached platinum you could use the lounge no matter what - however I did have business class tickets with Vietnam. Platinum status means nothing to them here. The ground staff service really drags Vietnam down. The staff passed to tickets to a male colleague who wrote down our names - which has never been done before and was not done to other passengers. No response when I asked what they were doing. Overall it's worth flying businesss with Vietnam if you want a lie-flat bed, but don't expect much more."

They have come a very long way, and the brand new B787, introduced this month to SYD, is exceptional. With new aircraft, not only are the passengers happier, but the staff seem much more attentive to service given the new environment. They seemed really proud of the improvement. The seats throughout are a vast improvement and are right up there with Singapore Airlines and the rest. I flew Premium economy and the seat was spacious and comfortable, and I am not a small framed man. Food was as good as previously and the IFE leaves the old systems for dead. Movie choice was good, screen excellent and headphones very good. I leave for Paris shortly and I look forward to my next journey. Particularly since I upgraded to Business Class. I must say that it intrigues me when I read reviews which criticise the service on Vietnam Airlines. I find the staff attentive, but not over patronising, which I prefer. I find the professional purring and fake smiles on some airlines just over the top. I do not expect the staff to become my new best friends when I fly, and I am happy with basic professional and polite service, and that is what you get on Vietnam Airlines.

The only reason I choose this airline is the short layover in Saigon, 30kg check in and reasonable costs for additional weight. There is one other option I'll mention later. Since April 2013 I have flown with Vietnam Airlines 40 or 50 + times on domestic and international routes and I fly down the back in coach. Where to start? Flights to and from Australia are currently using the oldest planes in the fleet. That's evident in the tatty appearance and antiquated entertainment system (pictured). The movie selection, number of movies as well as the system itself is totally inferior to any other airline that I have flown with. Because videos are on a loop (no fast forward, pause or rewind) you have to start watching a movie after it has already started or wait for it to start again. March 13 2016 I flew on VN773. When we were able to use the system all movies were already started, 10 or 15 minutes in and no way for crew to reset. On VN772 on June 20 the two middle rows closest had 1 screen out of the 6 working and two mums working hard to entertain young kids. On VN773 flight on July 20 two of the three entertainment systems in the row behind me weren't working.  On my August 16 VN773 overnight flight my screen just displayed static (pictured) and could not be turned off.  The seat to my left also had a non operational screen.  Inflight meals are nowhere near as good now as what they were and even if you request the likes of a vegetarian meal I've found on a number of occasions that that can be a lucky dip. I've even shown my confirmation, including a vegetarian meal being ordered and confirmed, and been told that I should have rung the day before to check. Pardon me? Vietnam Airlines is supposed to be full service, not a low cost carrier. Crew in coach smile a lot but they are very hard to find and really don't seem to understand what service is all about. Emailed complaints fall on deaf ears and take up to 6 weeks to reply to. I've emailed on a half dozen occasions and replies are similar and sometimes a copy/paste from previous emails, Dear sir, after receiving your letter, we have forwarded your comments to technical departments requesting to correct the errors and to take measure to avoid these inconveniences in the future.If they had then I wouldn't constantly bang on about the same things. These planes are flying 16 hours out of 24 with no time for maintenance on the entertainment system. At least from September 18 2016 Cathay Pacific has increased to 30 kg of check in luggage and reduced the cost of their excess so there is another, vastly superior, airline to consider."

It certainly helped to be able to have a shower and rest and a sightseeing tour. Food and beverage service was good, although the Gluten free meals ordered (for my husband) had fish for lunch and breakfast (not quite to Australian taste). On the return journey we added no seafood and then these meals were great. The cabin crew fulfilled any requests we had quite happily.

Only 4 PAX in business, not much to do, attendant served up a delicious beef dish to me and meals to the others, then returned to his seat and went to sleep, not a good look. Hanoi has a nice new terminal, passing through the transit counter to the lounge was easy. Lounge is new but not that good, reviewed in lounge reviews elsewhere here. Departure to Paris was delayed for 15 minutes while they went looking for 2 missing PAX, when these people did arrive they were drunk, not abusive or violent, but very loud and obnoxious, they should have never been granted boarding. As business class was not full everyone else (including me) moved as far away from the drunks as possible. Not a good start and ruined the atmosphere in the cabin for the duration of the flight. Flight attendants are obviously embarrassed and didn’t engage. Meal service was somewhat haphazard with different parts of the meal arriving at the wrong time. No turn down service is offered. Similar haphazard order for the breakfast service. 3 hours prior to arrival toilet paper had run out and was never replenished. Returning from Paris departed on time. I noticed ‘Tornado’ (similar to Fillet steak) on the menu and order that. But why would you put parmesan cheese on a steak? Pepper sauce, mushroom sauce, garlic sauce, sauce diane, even at a pinch perhaps a blue cheese sauce but not parmesan. As I’m familiar with VN now, we get the same haphazard service by non engaging attendants. Arrive at Hanoi, pass transit and go to lounge. VN611 is delayed 55 minutes, when we finally get airborne the aircraft (another old and tired A321) shakes violently on take off, slowly these vibrations stop, and we arrive uneventfully at BKK. On VN 19 (after the drunks incident) the captain informs us that they VN would appreciate feedback (he was obviously unaware of the drunks) and invites comments via the VN website. I did so after arriving home and waited 7 months for a reply that never arrived, so I asked why, not to VN Vietnam or VN Australia but (going on previous form) to VN Thailand, the deputy director of customer relations answered and asked me to resubmit as their site was hacked and my original email was probably lost, I did so and again heard nothing for over a month, so I sent another asking if they received my second submission. They simply replied yes, that was over a month ago now and I’ve heard nothing since, thus the delay in this review. With these new aircraft Vietnam Airlines has the potential to become a Cathay Pacific or Singapore Airlines but is unlikely to happen with their attitude. They would have a good product if only they could get their act together. You could do just as well with China Southern / Eastern or Royal Jordanian as they offer the same service for several hundred dollars less. Even Finnair, SriLankan airlines and Aeroflot are cheaper than VN."

I am impressed that this company goes against the main trend by maintaining a good business class on domestic sectors where low cost carriers are very aggressive in price-setting. VNs competitors on domestic routes tend to have much more frequent problems on delays and never ending fees. These 2 flights with Vietnam Airlines were faultless - and as usual: punctual. You know what you get and I cannot recall more than 2 delays on this route over the years – more than 60 flights - of which one was redirected to Danang due to typhoon. On this trip, I was given lounge access and a “limousine” service in both airports – this is actually just a small coach with polstered seats – but anyway. The dull interior of the A321 cabin and never changing menu starts to annoy me. Great attention from FAs despite they have not much to offer apart from hot snacks, coffee, and four different brands of beers. The classic old style declining business class seats are wonderful for these 1½ hours flights. No entertainment but an English language newspaper was offered. Ticket prices are approx. 200 USD was charged for a business class return on this sector, which is not cheap, but can be OK. Check-in took only a few seconds.

The level of information we were given was disgraceful and the Air France agents there weren't much help.

However I doubt that whatever system was in place many of the passengers would have taken any notice. Most people ignored the “fasten seat belt” sign and wandered around the aircraft, using the toilet and making mobile phone calls after being told not to do so. There was a child in front of us who kept climbing on the seats and was completely unsecured during the whole flight. Just ahead of take off a passenger near me continued to use his phone and had I not told him to turn it off, I suspect he would have used it in flight. We hit major turbulence just after take-off and the plane lost altitude but again the staff did not advise passengers to remain seated and to keep their seat belts on. Needless to say the child in front was still unsecured. On approach to Hanoi, the ignoring of the crew continued with people keeping their seats in the reclined position, tables down and the usual suspects walking about the cabin on approach. The woman in front completely ignored the crew when asked to return her seat to the upright position. It was only when my wife called the crew and insisted she was made to do so did it happen. If Vietnam Airlines wants to compete with other world class carriers then it needs to get cabin safety sorted. Staff need to be assertive with passengers and make it clear what is expected."

I booked this flight because it was advertised as a Boeing 787-9 flight. However it was not until check-in time did I discover that my flight was rescheduled to use the old A330-200. I was not very pleased with this as I tried my best to arrange my schedule to catch the so-called B787 flight. Moreover, the flight was delayed for 1 hour due to the fact that the originally scheduled A332 had been hit by birds during the final approach and we had to board a different plane. And the A332 we flew on was even older than the originally scheduled one."

Since we flew with them 2 years ago they have upgraded to the Boeing 787 and business seats are great and fully recline making for a good sleep on a long haul flight. The only main issue we had with this trip was the check in process in Melbourne. For some reason you cannot check in online out of Melbourne (you can out of Vietnam and London). Being in Business class this didn't worry me too much but when we arrived at the airport we were stuck in a queue for over 30 minutes due to other passengers with huge amounts of excess baggage (certainly not appreciated when we've paid extra to sit up front). I was worried we'd not make it through security in time for he flight. I suggest they need to open a line especially for these travellers or restrict luggage limits as it really was out of control and there were not enough check in staff to manage. I fear some economy passengers may have nearly missed the flight due to this also.

✅ Verified Review ,A350 / A330,Solo Leisure,Business Class,CDG to MEL via SGN,September 2016,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,4.0,5,yes,9,"  Review is a summary of return flight from Melbourne to Paris via Ho Chi Minh (and via Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh on the return leg). I've flown Business Class with two of the 5 Star and five of the 4 Star airlines and I rate Vietnam Airlines equal to the best and better than most. I will absolutely fly them again. The on-line check-in wasn't available but the process at the airport was fast and efficient. VN uses the Qantas Lounge in Melbourne (OK but not great), Air France in Paris (huge but very comfortable and good food) and their own in Ho Chi Minh (fairly small but comfortable). Because the time between connecting flights in Vietnam was more than 5 hours VN includes a free transfer to a hotel where in addition to the room you get an included meal in the restaurant. The transfer process for this is very friendly and seamless. On board service across all legs was absolutely consistent, of a very high pro-active standard and equal to the service I have experienced on 5 star airlines. The afternoon departure flights featured 6 course main meals with good choice and of very good quality - some of the best I have had. Four choices of wine including a French Grand Cru. Between meals on the long legs attendants came through with plates of canapés - including when only the insomniacs were awake. Planes. The A350 is superb. The elimination of central overhead bins gives a cathedral feel to the cabin. Because the layout is 1x2x1 and the side overhead bins so large there is more than enough storage space. Good seat privacy and fully flat beds. The A330 is starting to age but immaculately clean. The angle flat seats which have pull up privacy dividers are still very comfortable but with the usual ""slide down"" when sleeping on angle seats. The IFE is limited so load some movies or music on a USB or an iPad if you can't sleep on a plane. VN has an excellent product and really knows how to look after business class passengers both on the ground and in the air."

The airline wins in the end over others on punctuality and ability to communicate changes early and accommodate wishes to changes. All their competitors on domestic routes in Vietnam often hide, misinform, mislead, or reverse any problem – of which there are many. On top they have so many fees and taxes that even a zero-fare ends up being more expensive than VN-fares, which include luggage, seating, and no “payment convenience fees”. VN are very solid. An extremely conservative product kept in dull colours and design from the 80’ies. No food in Economy, some bites in Business. No entertainment. No shopping.

The food at the restaurant was mediocre. I would appreciate it if we could have had a lounge access. After boarding I was surprised that they switched back the aircraft to a B787-9. The flight attendants welcomed us warmly. Legroom was great but unfortunately, the seat width was very narrow. The seats were uncomfortable. It would make more sense if the seats configuration would be 2-4-2 instead 3-3-3. IFE had not been put into operation maybe because of the short flight. English Newspapers were offered on board.

However, the flight was on time which was more than I expected since there is a often half-an-hour delay for an average Vietnam Airlines flight (sometimes it can reach up to 4 hours).

To start things off the Vietnam Airlines staff at Sydney Airport told me at check in that I needed to purchase a $300 visa on the spot to board the aircraft - due to the fact that Vietnam Airlines preys on customers that book their ticket online un-aware of the visa requirements for a domestic flight within Vietnam. They purposely make their aircraft stop twice in Vietnam in order for a visa to be necessary on the way to Heathrow airport from Sydney. Upon arrival at Ho Chi Minh City airport (Tan Son Naht Airport) I was approached by staff of the airport who charged me $120 for a photo and a stamp, not only was that a rip off but it was a number they came up with on the spot, as I was able to bargain it down to $80. To make matters worse this incompetent airline and their rude staff lost my bag during their unnecessary 2-stop stop over, and all they offered me as a follow up procedure was a childish sheet of paper to write my name and colour of the bag - hopeless! I will not be flying this airline again, and I warn whoever does choose to fly with Vietnam Airline that they are aware of the visa requirements to transit within Vietnam, and to buy their visas before flying (which only costs $10 funny enough) or be faced with a $400 visa and stamp fee at the airport prior to departure. Oh, and on a final note - the inflight entertainment was very poor and outdated, especially for a long haul flight."

We didn't experience any of the delays that others complain about, and the ground-handling was efficient and maintained business-class/elite priority at all times. However, the business class seats on the Boeing 777-200 are horrible. It's 1990's business class, and it needs to go. From next year the Boeing 787-9 will be on the Sydney route, and the business class cabin is up-to-the-second modern. Until then, be warned - the 777 seat is OK on a day flight, but is exquisitely uncomfortable for sleeping. Our two short domestic A321 hops were comfortable enough, and the HAN-SGN sector on the A350-900 was fantastic. The crews were attentive and polite, but there was a very concerning lack of control over the cabin. Passengers were reclined for takeoff and landing, hand luggage remained on the adjacent seats for the entire trip, window shades remained closed, and passengers got up to use the toilets in the latter part of descent. None of these non-compliant behaviors was challenged by the cabin crew, who seemed to ignore the obvious safety hazard. If Vietnam Airlines wants to be a real threat to their A-grade competition from Singapore and Hong Kong, they need more than new aircraft and efficient ground-handling - they need to ensure that their crews can maintain cabin discipline to international standards. It's not enough to say, ""That's just their culture""; crews from the ""other"" Asian airlines are from similar cultures where elders and customers are treated with reverence, and it is hard to imaging a Singapore or Cathay passenger being permitted to remain reclined for landing. So Vietnam Airlines got us there and back in one piece, but I'm not completely confident that the cabin crews would be able to maintain discipline and order in a true emergency. I wouldn't fly with them again."

First of all, the flight was delayed for about an hour. But that is not the complaint. The complaint was when the flight was re-directed to Danang without any information broadcast from the captain. In fact, I noticed the captain hardly made any announcements or gave any info regarding the flight. The only words from him were ""Crew, get ready for landing or taking off"", that's all. On 22nd June, I heard the captain announce to the crew to get ready for landing. I was a bit surprised because it was too early for the flight to have reached Haiphong. Suddenly, after landing, we were told by the crew that we were in Danang. The captain did not make any announcements that we had been re-directed to Danang. I saw a lot of passengers in confusion as to why we landed in Danang without warning. Some asked the crew and were told that the weather in Haiphong was bad and that was why the flight had to be diverted to Danang.

Spend extra and fly with a better airline. Vietnam Airlines flights from Australia to the UK have 3 legs, which wouldn't be an issue except for the fact that you need to fly domestically in Vietnam and end up having to go through 4 different airports within Vietnam alone. Your luggage will not be transferred either, so be prepared to collect and check in bags numerous times. Because you go from international airport to domestic and then domestic to international a visa is required to enter Vietnam (which will set you back $500 return).

I was surprised to find pod business class seating on the A330 - it was not lay-flat, but I managed to get a good night's sleep. The only disappointment was the small and outdated IFE monitors, and the lack of storage around the seat compared with other airlines' offering. At HCMC, where we had to be bussed from the plane to the terminal, I was impressed that Vietnam Airlines made sure that business class passengers had a special bus which left for the terminal as soon as all passengers had disembarked.

✅ Verified Review ,Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,FRA to HAN,March 2016,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,"  We had a grand total of 4 flights booked with Vietnam Airlines between February and March (Frankfurt-Hanoi, Hanoi-Hue, Hoi An-Saigon, Saigon-Frankfurt). We were pleasantly surprised at how good Vietnam Airlines were. We had no problems with any delayed flights (one was delayed by 20 minutes, hardly a disaster). All the planes were in good condition, clean and comfortable, and the staff we dealt with were friendly. Everything seemed to be handled efficiently and capably. We did have a very long check-in at Saigon for some reason, however it was not a big issue for us. The food was ok, nothing spectacular but edible. Drinks were available easily. Considering the number of not-so-good reviews I read,  I was a little hesitant as our trip approached, however I needn't have worried. All in all, based on our first experience of Vietnam Airlines, I would not hesitate to recommend them for international or internal flights."
✅ Verified Review ,A350,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,CDG to HAN,April 2016,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,2.0,2,no,5,"  Flying to Hanoi with two friends, we checked in online in advance and were surprised to find our seats changed a few hours later. We were all separated so we changed our seats again. When we checked our luggage at the airport, seats had been changed again but we didn't notice until boarding. By chance, we could arrange with other passengers to get finally the seats we wanted! Asking politely a simple question about my upgrade status (I was éligible to business class) to the ground staff before boarding I was annoyed by a young lady (not VN staff) that would better choose another job without customer service. Flight was beginning very well! The flight itself was average. Minimal crew friendliness, minimal service, minimal safety procedure. Food was ok on this way, much worse on return flight. Seat comfort is disapointing on this A350 XWB (extra wide body!) aircraft : poor legroom, very short recline, tight seating. Like any other aircraft economy seat on most airlines. Due to improved overhead luggage storage, your luggage will probably travel more comfortably than you. Inflight entertainement system is up to date but the international movie choice really needs to be updated. Flight was on time."

Expectation was high as VN is using their latest equipment on this route. However, there was no 'wow' factor whatsoever. The seats were okay; not too comfortable and not too bad either. The food served was quite good. They distributed a menu individually to each passenger. Service wise, the crew was polite and efficient but they were nowhere to be seen after the meal service. IFE was so-so; the selection was quite limited. However, they have many inflight magazines available. Overall, a good experience."

This was a very very long 13 hours flight, with poor service, unfair crew (I didn't catch a simple smile!), very tight seating, short recline - on this A350 aircraft I was waiting for a better passenger experience. A simple glass of water had to be asked like an exceptional favor. After dinner, the rear galley was definitely closed for crew privacy. The mini bar appeared at the very end of this flight. Not a simple snack could be seen. Crew members were sleeping everywhere on door seats but not in their dedicated area. So there was no space where you could simply stretch out - except the toilet. Even one of their suitcases was laying around near the aft door. Is that supposed to be safe?  It's also my first time I see an aircraft taking off and landing with luggage beneath the feet of the front row passengers without any reaction of the crew. I must say the IFE is up to date on this new aircraft but programmes are rather average. I had watched everything I could watch on my flight out to Hanoi. Flight was on time and my luggage was there on arrival. That's the good point."

During the flight I was not feeling well and needed to lie down due to stomach cramps. My husband got up to enable me to do this and asked the flight attendants for help with finding a seat as he had noticed several available. The attendants refused to help and he was standing up for over two hours. Why was there no help given to seek a seat for my husband under these circumstances? It transpired that at least a dozen Vietnamese passengers had been given complete rows of three seats (in order to sleep throughout the flight). We even saw several family members split up in order to have a row of three each, just sitting up for meals. We could not understand why others were squashed into rows of three when there could have been more thought about giving everyone a bit more space not just a chosen few. This had also been the case on the flight out mainly in the middle rows and could not just be a coincidence. (I doubt if individuals had paid for three seats). Also our friends who were seated toward the front of the plane had problems with children talking all night therefore having no sleep whatsoever. They then discovered that they were in fact unsupervised as their mother was in asleep in business class! How was this allowed and why did no attendant intervene? This was one of the worst long haul flights we have ever had with appalling customer service."

Ominous start at NRT. The departures board had our flight status as ""Indefinite"" and the massive queue stretched the length of the departures floor. The flight to HAN was to go at 10am but left at 5pm. Reason given was ""technical"". The late departure meant that we could not make our connecting flight to BKK. The airline put us up at a hotel near the airport, the Me Linh. First impressions were not good. A roach met us in the lobby. But it was OK, it was dead. The hotel seemed new. Concrete dust covered most things in the room apart from the furniture. Our bathroom had no toilet roll, one pillow for 2 people, no aircon remote control, the water ran brown until it cleared. Plastic still covered the TV and refrigerator. Locking the room door caused the lock to break. Staff came to release us. Meal provided was poor. I suspect that no one from the airline checked that this hotel was suitable for their customers. And if not, why not. Flight the next day was due to depart at 9am but left at about 11. A technical issue was again cited as the reason. This further delay again put people under pressure who had rebooked connecting flights from BKK. Airline provided meal vouchers in NRT and HAN. We booked Vietnam Airlines as we had not used them before and wanted to give them a try. We had heard that they had some modern aircraft and were competitively priced. The actual flights were OK. There seemed to be a problem with the FA call button on the Boeing 787-9 armrest. Lots of people were hitting them with their elbows. Food was average. FAs a bit gloomy. IFE OK. This may read like a hotel review but I wanted it to be a reflection of the journey. Would we travel Vietnam Airlines again. Probably. Lightning striking twice "

Short flight, 1 hour gate to gate with a little over 30 mins in the air. Flight encountered technical difficulties due to strong winds on landing and had to pull up for a second attempt. That was a first time experience for me. The 2nd attempt at landing was brilliant, hardly felt a bump. I previously lived in Ho Chi Minh City for nearly 6 years and am glad to know that there are excellent, professional pilots in what I'd consider a mediocre airline for a flag carrier. They do, however, try their best in what is a tough consumer market in Vietnam."

Before the dinner, the staff forgot to serve the cocktails - maybe to finish sooner. Upon my request they served it to me, together with the dinner - which was one of the worst I had on an airplane. In Ho Chi Minh there was no special lane for Premium Economy passengers as at most airports. Can you tell me why I paid the price supplement. Actually this was the sole item which reminded me that I had a Premium Economy seat."

All on well kept A321 aircraft. All flights on time. While it’s a boring airline in terms of design, colours, food, and lacks service on board in economy (if less than 1½ hours flight duration), it gains from cheap airfares, reliable schedules, timekeeping, and quick and efficient luggage handling. Further, they are generous with luggage. Smooth security checks. Extremely fast check in counters and efficient ground staff. In all the three cases it took from 20 seconds to maximum a Minute to check in. The best is that they sell cheap tickets online if bought at right time. These 3, independent flights were costing me less than 90 USD in total - bought on their homepage under campaigns."

The hops were fine and short. The flights into and out of the country were not so good. I paid for the upgrade to Premium Economy which I normally do for long flights. This company provides the least extras than any I have experienced. They only give the bigger seat and foot room. The food and drink is the same as Economy and they do not have dedicated crew to tend to you. On the flight from Vietnam to London 3 of the seats were broken which forced couples to be separated for the flight. The food on the flight to Vietnam was not bad but it was awful on the way back. Once your food had been served you never saw the crew until it was time for the next meal. Don't know where they went. The in-flight entertainment was OK. You usually get newer movies than the ones they showed but I found a couple I hadn't seen before so I was OK. I would recommend that you do not sit in row 10 as the toilets are just in front of you. Row 15 is a curtain away from economy and on the way back I had a child behind me who if he wasn't yelling he was crying. I put in earplugs and the headset on to try to get some sleep.

Skyteam lounge at SYD is not up to Qantas standards but was more than adequate for our brief stay there. Check in and boarding in business were both a breeze. The first leg was only let down by the age and business class quality of the seats. The seats are old style business and don't recline fully, offer little privacy and not a lot of space to store things. Particularly annoying was when a passenger in front fully reclined in front items fell out of your seat back pocket onto the floor. The route has recently changed from an A330 covering this route and to be honest it feels like a step backwards. After a transfer in SGN we then switched to the 787. This was a 10/10 experience all round. Business class seating that beats QF and BA and SG on the same route (though not EK). Quality professional service and top of the line IFE. Wife and I agreed it was probably the best international business experience we have had. The only let down was the lack of fast track pass on arrival at LHR so we had to queue in the main line. VN really need to sort this out, otherwise the SGN - LHR route in business is quality service at extremely good value."

Arrived at Bangkok 5 hours early because of being scared of traffic, and when we got to the check in counter, we were told to wait and asked for immigration forms and the lady at the counter didn't get us any. The same lady that refused us immigration forms checked us in with a smile, which seems genuine! (very strange). The lounge was third party, overcrowded and with some very noisy people. Boarding was slow because of one gateway for both classes, and boarding drinks were served during pushback. We were asked what meals we wanted, and it was the same three things I got 1 year ago. Beef with noodles, pork with mash, and fish with rice. The pork of course, is the worst. I chose beef. One thing about the seat : if you sit in row 4, you will be reclining into the guy at the economy class seat. This cabin staff was especially nice to me by bringing drinks within seconds of the request. Arrival has no transfer assistance, Hanoi airport T2 is new and shiny. Not a lot of shopping. The things sold there the most is just brandy. Lounge is new and modern, natural style, not a lot of food to choose from though. The flight to Narita and the boarding is not very long, full cabin, though only 3 attendants for 28 business class passengers. No after takeoff food served. The breakfast is what is served. Amenity kit to expectation. Fully flat bed, window shaders are not working. The flight attendants had ok English. Overall, a satisfactory experience"

The mood lighting and the electronic blind worked well. Entertainment system was not as bad as others described - large screen, high resolution. The films provided are not as good as other major airlines but sufficient enough for a night flight. Seats are bit narrow but the leg room was good. Before my flight I contacted Vietnam Airlines office in London and was informed that my luggage will be checked through PQC. When I arrived at Heathrow the ground agent told me the luggage will be delivered to SGN only and I will need to claim luggage, clear immigration and then re-check in at the domestic terminal. Not a problem as I arrived at a quiet time in the morning. Service, on the other hand, was minimal. The crew did their meal duty then disappeared. Most of the time they were chatting or eating in the galley. Very limited interaction with passengers. The toilets weren't cleaned. Domestic sections were much better. A321 planes not brand new but clean and well maintained. Crew more friendly than international flights and spoke better english. If VN could focus on service delivery and their presentation I think it could be a 4 star airline."

They also refused to refund the tickets that we lost and they did everything they could not to talk to the passengers in Paris, leaving the burden to Air France who had no decision making authority on that matter. I have been writing to them since 2 months and no acknowledgment whatsoever of my and other passengers claims.

During the checkin the lady at the counter was given a hard time by the manager because my kids were members of GLP but not Titanium members. The A350 Premium Economy seat was uncomfortable, as wide as economy seats with a little extra leg room and extra degree or two recline. The monitor kept turning on and off by itself which made it very difficult for my kids and I to sleep during the whole flight. The armrest cannot be lifted up. I complained and the response I got from one of the flight attendants was they will come back and check on my monitor and turn it off for me if they find the monitor is on - he never did come back to check.

Each passenger is served individually, not the mass service via cart as many other airlines nowadays also provide in Business Class. Transit both in HCM City and Hanoi was fast and uncomplicated, the Lotus lounges adequate, whereas the Hanoi lounge is newer and has a better ambience than the HCM City one.  On both long-haul legs we were on the 787, which has flat bed seats in a 1-2-1 configuration, which allowed for a good rest. Inflight entertainment system is good, screens of high quality and we had the impression that compared to earlier reviews the selection of international movies has improved, albeit not yet at the standard of Singapore Airlines or Emirates.

Singapore to Ho Chi Minch City is comparable to Silkair. Ho Chi Minch City to Sydney is more comparable to premium economy overall. Crew was very attentive and offered ok drinks selection. Food was not up to competitors business class standards and neither was the seat - think early 2000s recliners - but better than a typical premium economy product. Inflight entertainment would have been poor even if it had worked (the inflight entertainment guide introduces a decent selection of movies and TV programs but only a quarter or so would have been actually available). However, none of the four of us could get the inflight entertainment system to work and neither could a Vietnam Airlines engineer who was travelling on board. Not a big problem since it was an overnight flight but I hope Vietnam Airlines has state of the art inflight entertainment systems on their new planes. However, given price/value still an ok product."

The IFE had no sound and they didn't give the headset for all. The quality of IFE is bad for an international route with no AVOD. They only had shows like gags! The food had a good review from me, and had quite good taste."

As it is a small aircraft, we could feel the turbulance. When landing at Siem Reap Airport, it was hard landing and not so smooth. The cabin looks old. The inflight meal was good but the inflight magazine is out of date. The cabin crew were friendly and welcoming passengers. The ground staff check in were effective. The price was good in comparison with other airlines. The flight was delay around 15 minutes but still acceptable because of the bad weather. For safety always check if the swimm vest is under your seat."

First time flying Vietnam Airlines and was pleasantly surprised. Boeing 777 flights on old style recliner seats but comfy enough for an 8 hour trip, plus got a good sleep on the way home. Boeing 787 comfort, service and catering is up there with the Middle East carriers. Long stopover in Saigon in both directions but all transfers, 4* hotels and meals handled by VN. Yes, when flying for business it is a pain as you want to just get there and back but for the fare, it is bearable. VN was never on my radar before but will happily fly with them again in a few weeks when heading back to London for a few days."

Check in at Frankfurt was quick with friendly staff. Boarding was organized. Crew service was very friendly, flight attendant welcomed at the door and takes me to my seat, offers boarding drinks, amenity kit and headphones. The menu cards and winelist was given before take off.  The meal was more than enough and had a very good taste. After meal, fruit, cheese, ice cream and cakes together with coffee or tea. A full flat seat meant I could sleep most time of the flight until breakfast service. The entertainment is limited in the choice of available films, but there were enough movies or series available.

Service was attentive and helpful, food was average but in line with most long haul economy class. The seat has a 10.6 inch TV which is located in the armrest. Economy deluxe seats have decent stretch and are comfortable in a 2-3-2 layout. Vietnam Airlines provides a wash bag and slippers which is a nice touch as many airlines have replaced slippers with socks. I would recommend Vietnam Airlines on their new aircraft."

Firstly, the fares were not among the most affordable we could find, which can then lead the customer to expect a certain quality. The 777 flown between between Paris and Hanoi was in need of some care, my seat had a broken table so I was asked to change to a different seat which then had a damaged armrest. The seat was at the end of its life too. The entertainment system was an old generation one, with no on demand programs and a small screen. Noise in the cabin was too loud - like on most B777's. Service was pretty good though, with friendly staff, and food ok. Overall I wouldn't recommend it. "

Flight in Hanoi was delayed 1 hour which was informed by email 10 hours prior to departure. Arriving in amble time prior scheduled departure I easily managed to change my flight to an earlier departure without any penalties nor other problems. Thus, arrived 3 hours earlier than scheduled. Domestic Lounge is old, but cozy and quite efficient. It provides a good view to lanes and motor-highway, has hot food, snacks, and drinks though no spirits nor wines.  A321 business class seats provide full comfort. Cold snacks, beers, and sparkling sodas provided. Priority luggage, boarding, shuttle, and check-in lanes for business class passengers. Miles for my Flying Blue were inserted the following day."

The flight crew were all very nice and we were served a light meal which was fish and rice, served with red wine, fresh juice and water. The plane was clean and we were given pillows and blankets.

Flight due to depart 11am. On checking in I was informed the plane would be delayed till 8pm. The plane had not arrived the night before (due at 9 pm) so it was already known that the delay would be significant - yet on their website it showed on time and no delay. Based on that info I set out for the airport at  am. The staff gave out no information and when pestered said operational reasons. No apologies. The fact that the airline knew the plane had not taken off the other end seemed be irrelevant. We were shipped off to a hotel in Feltham and spent till 8pm before checking in again. The plane eventually departed 11.5 hours after schedule. There was no mention of this delay once onboard and the cabin crew looked as fed up as the passengers. The inflight entertainment was bad and dated. The food passable but not great. All my internal flights with Vietnam Airlines were also delayed with no apology. This airline ruined my holiday as I missed out on several planned trips.

The return flight on 28 November was a different story. Instead of the scheduled Boeing 787, it was an old Boeing 777-200 with well worn, old business class seats, entertainment system not operating throughout the plane. At origin they offered compensation but had no cash or checks. Cabin crew tried hard to please. Flyer beware."

Eventually it was scheduled 1 hour later than originally booked. Boarding was delayed for another 30 min and after we made some extra loops, we arrived more than 1 hour (or 2 hours after original booking) late. The service was basic, but that's OK for a domestic flight. Nothing unusual."

Quiet, and there appeared to be more leg space than normal. Pleasant crew. What a shame that the inflight entertainment could not match. Many people on our flights were unable to watch/listen to films/TV/Music because of the poor quality of picture and/or sound. There would be a few minutes when everything was good and then the picture would break up and sound totally incomprehensible. It seemed to affect screens in rows of 3. Should you have been fortunate enough to watch films there was a total lack of modern or recent films. We spent 24 hours of flying time only being able to access Soduko or the Flight map (which is very good!). The food we were served was cool but this may have been due to us being towards the end of the servings. 4 internal flights were fine but were basically just up and down short hops."
,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to SGN,November 2015,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,2.0,5,yes,8,"We flew Vietnam Airlines from London Heathrow to Ho Chi Minh City and returned from Hanoi to London, with three additional flights (in Vietnam and Cambodia). Bad start as the check-in was chaotic and we waited for over an hour in what was a relatively short queue. Thereafter, the experience improved. We flew on one of their new aircraft. The seats were comfortable with plenty of legroom. The outbound flight was not full, so we were able to move to other seats for increased space and comfort. The food was good. I opted for the Asian choices as they tend to heat up better than European food, and they were tasty and sufficient. Wine was served and I received three large glasses in total, which is as much as I would normally expect. The IFE took the form of in-seat screens, which were large and the resolution was fine. There was a reasonable choice of films to watch, though they weren't the latest blockbusters. I was able to watch a couple of films that I had missed a few months ago at the cinema, plus some older classics that I had never seen. The main point is to pass the time, so that was just fine with me. The crew were friendly and DID smile. I asked for a snack in the middle of the flight (instant noodles) and was served immediately. My overall impression of the long-haul flights was good. The shorter, internal flights were fine too, though only water was served. All flights were on time."

I booked Vietnam Airlines on the basis that the long sector would be on the new Boeing 787 and therefore offer a flat bed for the 12 hour flight. Prices were good but other airlines offered similar or fares close to what was paid. The first leg Bangkok to Ho chi Minh was non eventful and as expected for a short regional flight. But upon arrival into Ho chi Minh I was shocked at the state of the business class lounge. It was extremely tired and offered nothing much more than cans of soda / water. What food was offered looked old and pastey certainly a risk to eat it (was not refrigerated). Upon boarding the flight to Heathrow it was quickly evident that the advertised Boeing 787 was a no show and in its place was a tired tatty old Boeing 777. The aircraft was filthy, seating was broken and archaic and the entertainment system didnt work. Ipads with 5 very old movies were given out, but if the seat in front reclined you couldnt stand it up to watch anyway, When I addressed these issues to the crew they openly admitted all the faults shrugged and dissappeared. The meal service was inedible, even a simple dish like the Pho. So it was a long hungry trip to London with no entertainment to boot. My adjacent passenger was also livid with the experience having completed 8 sectors on Vietnam Airlines  all of which were as bad. Overall the experience was worse in Business class than other airlines in Economy. A total waste of money. Upon arrival in Heathrow I tried to speak to VN staff but they were not interested. Needless to say i didnt fly back with Vietnam Airlines but rebooked on Thai Airways back to Bangkok, onboard the lovely A380 in a very nice business class pod. Fly Vietnam Airlines at your own risk, pay a little more and ensure you have a good flight with a better airline."
,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hue to Hanoi,November 2015,4.0,4.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,10,Vietnam Airlines from Hue to Hanoi. Smooth check in with no queue and check in counter automatically gave me exit row seat. The aircraft was boarded via a bus but this was just 20 metres or less!. The flight about 75% full and was punctual with good pilot communications. It's a 1 hour flight and staff gave every one a bottle of water and left everyone in peace with minimum disruptions. Baggage was quickly delivered and whole process was seamless.

I often select holiday destinations based on the availability of direct flights from Singapore. Friendly and attentive crew serving an often almost empty business class cabin. Perfect time slots when taking hotel check-in and check-out timing into consideration.  Food and snacks are acceptable.  When rerouted due to cancellation of a flight, we were surprised with a small refund, paid in cash in Ho Chi Min. Not a big amount, but a nice gesture. Once the outbound direct flight was cancelled and re-booked with a transfer in Ho Chi Minh. Due to very short transfer time in Ho Chi Minh, we, as business class passengers, were supposed to be escorted through customs, passport check and to the domestic terminal. This resulted in chaos. Mainly due to the ground attendant for some reason having to serve many other (economy) passengers as well. Also, the second leg (Ho Chi Minh to Phu Quoc) was in a very small turboprob airplane. Again chaos and no business class. The flight back was as per normal: direct flight in business class. Good to start your holiday. Will use again."

Returning from Nha Trang to Ho Chi Minh, due to change of flight time we missed our flight. On speaking with their office in Nah Trang the person was unhelpful, said there were no available seats until possibly 10.30pm. He said he would call us back in 1 hour and didn't. When we phoned back the office was shut for lunch. As we had to be back in Ho Chi Minh we booked with another airline with the view we would follow this up on our return home. Little did we know that when we checked in at Ho Chi Minh Airport we were advised that we were not booked on our flight back to Australia as we had not taken the leg from Nha Trang and to add insult to injury, we had to pay for preticketing. Then they advised that the bassinet for the 1 year old had been allocated to a mother and infant. They were dishonest as when we got onboard the seats were taken by a mother and teenager. The extra cost to us was some $2500 and after 3 months of communication they have refused to refund any of this money. This is my first review. As a frequent traveller I have never experienced such poor customer service from ground staff to flight attendants and together with the worrying poor condition and age of the planes, I would not recommend ever flying with Vietnam Airlines."

Couldn't prebook the seats going out but had 3 together. The plane seats were very comfy and adequate leg room. Take an iPad as the films are quite limited, also wifi didn't work on the way out. The food was terrible, luckily took some food on for my daughter and she had a roll. The service is probably the worst ever, one drinks service, they then go and sit for about 8 hours before one more meal service. My biggest concern was the non existent safety checks. They didn't carry out any seat belt checks, one lady was still in the toilet ten minutes before landing and two people next to us didn't even have their belt on for landing.  We paid £1200 for 3 return direct flights - cheaper than flying to Greece!"

Compared to the old B777 it was a big step forward for VN. The seats were fully flat and every seat has direct access to the aisle. Seat was spaciuos and comfortable. The service by the crew was excellent and personal. During the whole flight the crew was very attentive and helpful. The meals were great and delicious with a very good quality and quantity. IFE had a bigger choice than on the old B777, but still behind other airlines. The Screen had an excellent HD quality. Overall I would recommend flying on the new B787."

The aircraft's used were both rather new A321-200s - VN-A361 and VN-A611 - with the cabin of the former showing some wear and tear and that of the latter being in very good condition. I found the Economy Class seat more than adequate for the short-to-medium-haul flights for which Vietnam Airlines uses its fleet of A321-200s. The legroom and seat pitch were comparable to those of the short-to-medium-haul Economy Class products of other full-service airlines. The lack of an audio/video on demand (AVOD) system was missed, though the short films shown on the overhead screens helped break the monotony of the flight. The catering from Singapore was not as good as I expected but the catering from Hanoi was excellent - it should be noted, though, that I ordered the lacto-ovo vegetarian meal (VLML). The crew conducted all service efficiently and with courtesy. I particularly appreciated Vietnam Airlines' use of Terminal 3 in Singapore as well as the 30kg baggage allowance. For the price of S$252.20 return, Vietnam Airlines offered excellent value for money."

Every flight was late, with no explanation or apology by ground crew, cabin crew or pilot. Bangkok to Hanoi leg there was no IFE system and it seemed to be old seats in a new plane. Hanoi to London Heathrow using the same seat configuration as Cathay Pacific but took the cheapest seat options: headphones were terrible, seat buttons already broken, movie selection was Vietnamese movies and 1960/1970 ""classics"" (there were only 4 recent hollywood movies). Food was good. Cabin crew service lacks the polish of better airlines, obviously lacked training. WiFi was available onboard for free, but in total I got one webpage to load briefly and that was it - perhaps it is still in testing. No priority lane immigration cards were given to biz passengers. Most worrying thing was a ""technician"" prodding a ceiling light back into place just before takeoff, which makes me question the maintenance on the planes (they are only 9 months old). Effectively you are getting lie-flat economy with a very limited movie selection."

Both were just an hour long. Even so drinks and a nice snack were served, as were cold towels before takeoff and hot towels after the snacks. FAs were attentive and friendly. Our only complaint was the lack of legroom in our business class bulkhead seats. On the Ho Chi Minh City to Hue flight we had more legroom than in first class on a United Airlines domestic flight. Both planes were new and clean, and announcements in English as well as Vietnamese were clear and loud."
,A320 / Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Business Class,SGN to HAN,September 2015,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,3.0,3,yes,6,"Vietnam Airlines lounge at Ho Chi Minh City is reasonable, lounge at Hanoi cramped and ill-equipped, but as it was a relatively short stay it was quite adequate. Outbound check in a little chaotic; was issued with economy boarding card at the business desk, but the lady was very apologetic and rectified it immediately (whether it would have really mattered I don't know, as the seat number was correctly allocated), also directions were a little vague (not too bad for me as I have transited SGN several times, but may have been confusing for a first time visitor). Take off time was later than scheduled, but I had received email notification about a week previously, so it was easy to rearrange my plans to suit. Very comfortable seat outbound, friendly cabin crew who came around with the wine bottle a number of times during the short flight to Hanoi, more quickly than I could drink the stuff in fact! I can't comment on the food in either direction as I had already eaten at the hotel so didn't partake. Inbound on the new Boeing 787 was good and bad; the ""pod"" seat was a good size and 1-2-1 configuration. means everyone has easy aisle access. Service onboard was again satisfactory for a short trip, though nothing special. What I really disliked though was the air-bag equipped seat belt! Yes I know it may well do me a huge favour should something unpleasant happen, but it is horribly uncomfortable to wear. As the national carrier they were a lot closer to their advertised schedules than the low cost operators, and barring the initial hiccup, check-in and boarding was on the whole a lot less of a scramble too."
,A321 / Boeing 787 / 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,KUL to HAN via SGN,August 2015,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,3.0,3,yes,6,"Flew four sectors with Vietnam Airlines at the end of August 2015, KUL-SGN return and SGN-HAN return. The KUL-SGN sectors were rather uneventful - the flights were on time and there were no problems retrieving checked in luggage. The inflight meals were tasty. Wine served to those who wanted it. The flight attendants worked hard but were rather robotic. Overall, it is not a bad flying experience on this international route. My main reason for flying the domestic SGN-HAN sector was to sample Vietnam Airlines  new products on their Boeing 787-9 and A350-900 aircraft. I was on the Boeing 787-9 on the SGN-HAN sector and the aircraft was new. However, the IFE was not operational as it was a short domestic sector. The seats were a tad too narrow for my liking (3-3-3 in economy class) but legroom was sufficient. Cabin service is similar to Vietnam Airlines domestic flights - a light snack and nothing more. The flight ended on a sour note - my checked in luggage was contaminated by prawn/fish oil paste from other customer luggage. VN did not redeem itself too well and it was the airport workers who helped me clean up my bag. As it was close to midnight, I did not lodge any complaint with VN. The HAN-SGN sector was more disappointment. I did not manage to get on the A350 and was on a regular B777-200 ER flight. The aircraft was old and tired and some LCD screens onboard have seen better days. The original A350 flight that I was booked on was changed once already - the airline switched me to an earlier A330 flight. I wrote back and declined that flight and explained that I needed an A350 flight. They then switched me to an even earlier A350 flight. I thought that all was well and good at the time and looked forward to the flight. Unfortunately, the aircraft allocated to my flight was switched. All I can do was watch the A350 flight from my aircraft as it was on the next flight, 10 mins behind us. All in all, Vietnam Airlines is okay if you are on a budget. I do not think I will be flying them to Europe, based on the experience above."

For domestic routes, deluxe economy cabin is for economy class passengers. As I’m a Gold member I was upgraded to deluxe economy. The check-in procedure was quick with Sky Priority counter. The VN lounge at HAN is not too big and crowded sometimes. The food is so so and not impressive. The wifi was not too fast, not too slow, enough to surf. This lounge does not serve fresh noodles. The deluxe economy seats are arranged in 2-3-2 configuration with a seat pitch of 42 inches, foot rest and leg rest. Power and USB are provide. My feeling when seating in this seat was very comfortable. It’s almost the same with regional business class seat on Vietnam Airlines’ Airbus A321. The windows are impressive also.  The inflight service started long take-off on this 1:40 hrs domestic flight, dinner was served. The meal tray came with hot meal, soft drink and tea/coffee.

First, their website if you're buying in Vietnam doesn't support credit cards from the US. Second, when I went to the office in Quinhon to buy my ticket, they couldn't speak a lick of English. So, I buy a flight to Kuala Lumpur. Baggage lost in Saigon. They gave me a tiny piece of paper that was supposed to be my ticket claim for my bag but I lost it. So, basically it was a huge pain and I spent a week without my suitcase. Then, flying from Kuala Lumpur to Hanoi, they closed the counter one hour before I was supposed to fly and I missed the flight. They were entirely unhelpful. I don't recommend Vietnam Airlines.

During boarding for Singapore crew insisted that I must buy a return ticket and that I will have trouble in Singapore without one. Complete nonsense. They did not let me board the aircraft. Only after all other passengers were boarded and a hefty discussion with the head of the crew I was finally allowed to board the plane more than 1hr later. This time I was hold back in a transit aisle, kind of nowhere. No problems entering Singapore, just as expected. Except that my luggage was lost in Ho Chi Minh City. It was found after some phone calls but then took 3 days to get it to Singapore. The service during this time was just miserable : no call back, wrong or misleading information, just no one had a clue."

Flights excellent as was service and food. On return trip from Paris to HCMC great trip with service and food of a high quality. Flight home from Ho Chi Minh City to Melbourne was again excellent. We were in seats 4A/C on all legs of our trip. Didn't have a problem being near the galley and managed to sleep well on all flights. We have flown Vietnam Airlines Business many times and never had a problem with flights, food or service. We are happy to recommend them as an alternative to other airlines that charge more. "
,A321,Family Leisure,Business Class,Ho Chi Minh to Danang/Camranh,August 2015,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,no,2,"There was nothing special about Vietnam Airlines inflight experience. However, ground service and check in was a joke. There was no service for business class passengers. Doesn't matter if you were business class passengers or not, you would still have to wait for business counter to check in coach passengers before you. Top off, check in staff were errogant and didn't know about service.  4 of us travelled together, however only one of us waited in line. Once I got to the counter, the check in clerk told me everyone has to wait in line with their luggage. I told them that it was a family traveled together and I was holding all passenger passports to check in. Neverthless, she insisted we all had to wait in line together. "
,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh to Melbourne,September 2015,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,5,yes,8,"We flew Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh return plus 4 internal flights with Vietnam Airlines . My expectations for an economy fare is to be fed, have something to watch and sleep if it's an overnighter. Every flight was on time, the food was good, there was in flight entertainment - not great but enjoyed some good movies. The plane was half empty so got to stretch out and sleep due to so many empty seats. I found staff pleasant and helpful. Okay, they're not overly friendly and some of the ground staff didn't crack a smile at check in, but they did their job and in economy I guess that's what you get."

But generally, it is acceptable since it is not delayed. The second connecting flight from Ho Chi Minh to Osaka was quite good, the pilot did a very good job with the typhoon. However, Vietnam Airlines should work on improving its served meals and the in-flight entertainment. The food was not good, I mean it is not Asian taste. And the inflight magazine was kind of boring, most of the contents are in Vietnamese, I couldn't understand most of it. The video and audio seem so boring."
,A330-223,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh City,September 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5.0,4,yes,9,"Flew with Vietnam Airlines yesterday (3rd September) from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh City. Take off was excellent. For the price, it was good for this time of the year. Cabin Crew did their job well. The entertainment was okay, not much to do, but the sky map was what I stuck to the most. When we got to Vietnam, the landing was smooth."

Overall, flying with Vietnam Airlines was a pleasant journey. The flight attendants were nice and my food was served early due to the special request I have made. The seat condition was acceptable, I did not expect much for the fare that I had paid. The screen resolution of AVOD on B777 was satisfactory while the A321 was only equipped with an overhead screen. The Lotusmiles point was credited into the account few days after flying which is very fast. "
,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,HCM to DAD,August 2015,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"Relatively short hop. Efficient boarding, on time departure and arrival. Efficient inflight service by pleasant FA's. Not much more you could ask for."

The flight was smooth with on time departure/arrival. Their stewardesses were polite and attentive to passengers. They attended to my request (meals, water) for my kids. The food was better than the food I had on my long haul flight with Air Canada from Tokyo to Toronto. "
,A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,REP to PQC via SGN,August 2015,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"We booked a direct flight on Vietnam Airlines about 2 months before our departure, from Siem Reap to Phu Quoc, a one hour flight. 2.5 days before our flight was to depart, we received an email from Vietnam Airlines informing us that our flight was cancelled, no reason provided. Our new itinerary required flying from Siem Reap to Saigon, laying over for 4 hours, and then flying from Saigon to Phu Quoc - an all-day affair. When we emailed asking about compensation we were ignored. When we called to get clarification on our new flights (they sent us 2 emails with 2 different itineraries) we were hung up on. Finally received an email that no compensation would be given (not even use of the lounge, or a drink voucher) since we were notified more than 24 hours before departure. When we arrived at the check in counter no one could check us in, because their system was down. After an hour we were finally able to check in and were informed that our bags would not be transferred to our connecting flight in Saigon, nor could they give us a boarding pass for our connecting flight. We would have to collect our bags, clear customs, re-check in to get our second boarding pass, check bags again, and then go through security again. Our flight out of Siem Reap was delayed for an hour. On our flight, we were not offered any soft (or hard) drinks or snacks, but they did give us a tiny bottle of water. There were several empty seats in business class. When we landed in Saigon, we all stood in the aisle for 20 minutes waiting to deplane, as I guess there was no jetway available. As we got off the plane, there was a sign for the passengers to Phu Quoc, so we stood by it. An employee of Vietnam Airlines came over and gave us a sticker that said “Transfer,” and then pointed toward the immigration counters. No idea what it was for, no info given. At baggage, another airline employee asked for our tickets (again, no idea why.) He said after we got our bags he would provide further instruction. But after we got our bags he was gone. Someone else motioned us toward another terminal. So we dragged our bags down the sidewalk for about 5-10 minutes until we arrived at the domestic terminal, still not sure if we were in the right place, why we were wearing stickers, where the guy from baggage claim went, or why we were in the wrong city. We finally made it to the check in counter, and again asked about an upgrade, just so we could at least relax in the lounge until our next flight left. We were informed that we could purchase an upgrade if we wanted. We approached the Vietnam Airlines customer service counter just to recount the handling of the situation and the manager at the customer service counter told us that unfortunately they had just had so many angry customers that day that they could not afford to offer any sort of compensation to all of them, not even a water. That's a review in itself right there. Our next plane also was an hour delayed. The delays were not the frustrating part though, how the airline continued to not care was the kicker, If there is another option for your travel, I recommend you take it even at 3x the price."
,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Hanoi,July 2015,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"We booked this flight because of the Boeing Dreamliner 787-9, a week before take off they announced that they have changed the plane we are flying on to the most basic plane in the company. Got to the airport, delayed by 6 hours. We exclusively used Vietnam airlines, we had 8 flights with them in Vietnam and Cambodia. Only 2 of them were not delayed by more that 2 hours. 1 was cancelled, and the rest were awfully late. My father and partner both had business class tickets but at the check in desk the junior boy staff member decided my father was only allowed to check in 1 bag. "

A330-200 was packed - not one vacant seat. The unsmiling cabin crew failed to take action when passengers ignored the seatbelts sign and wandered off to the toilets while it was illuminated. Only a cursory glance to check if seat belts were secured was made before take-off. Dinner was tasty, if a little dry in parts, possibly from slight overheating and I noted that 3 of the cabin attendants were smiling during the food and drinks serving. The 2 toilets I went to were clean, and well-stocked including toothbrush packs and razors. IFE worked okay with its limited menu and at least 4 times during the flight, drinks were offered to those awake in the darkened cabin. It seems the attendants were more attentive on this flight and as we were approching Sydney, the purser, wearing a yellow uniform, patrolled throughout the aircraft double-checking the shades, seat belts and seats upright. The captain made up time and we landed in SYD 8 minutes early."

They don't know how to smile, very bad. At Heathrow they maked me missed the flight because of wrong information they gave me. So they send 3 times goes to British Airways to change my tickets, but the lady there said that it was Vietnam Airlines fault because they gave me the wrong information. I came back to them 3 times and everytime they just let me waiting like half an hour (the answers was always that is not our fault, go to British Airways again). I was really tired of walking with my luggage, I have been 7 hours walking at the airport to ask everyone to help because i'm not bringing alot of money to buy a tiket to get back to Amsterdam. So end up they were closed and said that someone will come to help me, but I was just waiting for 2-3 hours again. I had to stay at the airport 2 days to waiting my mom to booking another fight for me on the internet to go back home. So this is my first and last time going with the Vietnam airlines."
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Da Nang to Bangkok via SGN,August 2015,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,2,This is possibly the worst airline I have flown. Very hostile service especially with the ground staff at Da Nang. They only let us check-in at one specific counter with a long queue even though there were other 5 free counters. No one was smiling and the staff were acting like we were a burden to them! No entertainment on the flight. Food was just 2 pieces of ham and a bread roll. We took 4 legs of flights in total and all of them were delayed. 
,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Hanoi,July 2015,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,4.0,5,yes,8,The flight was 30 minutes late on take off. the cabin crew English language skills were weak but they were helpful and friendly. The food was relatively good and seating was no worse than a typical Virgin or BA flight. The real complaint was that the IFE was very dated but as an overall package that avoids a stopover (you cannot fly to Vietnam from the UK directly with anyone else) it was excellent value for money.

Award tickets flexible and free and easy to change and valid for a year. Aircraft an A321. Check in smooth, flights punctual, and boarding and luggage handled fine. Cabin colours and interior design are very dull, dark, and conservative.  No entertainment. A bottle of water and tissue were given to each passenger.  Apart from that the 4 crewmembers had absolutely nothing to do - nothing to sell, nothing to provide."
,A330-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,SYD to SGN,July 2015,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,3.0,4,no,3,"SYD-SGN on Vietnam Airlines because of the 8 hour flying time compared to 13-15 hours travelling time for its competitors. Check in was terribly slow, mainly due to the high percentage of passengers who had 3 or 4 large cartons as excess baggage. It all has to be weighed and labelled and that takes time. On boarding, the cabin crew pointed us unsmilingly towards our seats. The A330-200 looked in good condition with the cabin clean and tidy. We asked for extra seats at check-in so we could stretch out and had 4 seats to ourselves. In the rear cabin section there were only about 30 passengers. With the seat-belt sign illuminated the crew made no attempt to check the passengers or items on seats. While the A330 was waiting to enter the runway, the woman sitting in front of us stood up and walked to the rear toilet. The two cabin crew looking at her frowned but said and did nothing to stop her. During the flight, the seat belt sign was illuminated and passengers told to belt up as there was turbulence ahead. The flight smoothed out but the sign stayed on for over an hour but some passengers took no notice and moved around the cabin without challenge. The PTV selection is limited but passable, however my unit locked up and none of the controls would fix it. After a frustrating ten minutes I reported it to the cabin crew who advised me to change seats. Okay, but later my wife’s PTV also locked, but later went into re-boot and after several minutes, the programs returned, but the screen was still locked. Food served during the flight was edible. The toilets used by us were in poor condition. Floors wet, dirty stains under the seats, damaged fascia around the mirror, toilet seat and cover broken away from its mountings and tissues on the floor. We didn't see cabin attendant refresh or tidy toilets. On the final approach to Saigon, with the seat belt sign illuminated, passengers still moved about the cabin uncontested by the crew. Of the attendants who worked our part of the cabin, only one was smiling, and she kept it up all the flight. All in all, a very deficient performance from a somewhat surly cabin crew and poor maintenance, particularly the toilets."
,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London Gatwick to Ho Chi Minh City,March 2015,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"It has taken me some time to recover from the awful experience of flying with Vietnam Airlines. We booked a multi-destination holiday which involved flying with this airline 5 times, both domestic and International. There were 8 people travelling together (including 2 toddlers). The customer service is shockingly bad, both at check in and on board. The staff on board treated us terribly. Dished out food and drink to us as if we were in a prison, one even nudged me on the shoulder with the tea tray he was carrying. When I asked (several times) for a sandwich for my 3 year old, I got a tuna and cheese sandwich, loosely wrapped in cling film, which looked like it had been home made from a kids lunch box and had enjoyed many hours of sitting in warm air. Suffice to say, I did not deem it safe to feed to my daughter. Picture attached! I cannot express how awful these flights, bar one (we did one business class flight), were. The entertainment system was very out of date with bad pictures and a very small selection of movies and games. I understand that flying economy means that we may not enjoy many of the frills offered by more premium seats, as I often use budget airlines, but this is on a another level! Even service offered on airlines such as Ryanair and Easyjet far exceeds that received from Vietnam's national airline. What a bad representation of Vietnam. I will never fly with this airline again, even if it means paying more to use an alternative carrier. I even wrote to the airline to report my experience and am still waiting for a response after two months. Perhaps they employ the same stewards to deal with complaints. Pay that bit extra and avoid the nightmare of Vietnam Airlines."
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Saigon,July 2015,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,no,3,"I was very disappointed on all my 5 flights. Leaving Sydney we were delayed by approx 50 mins. This I know is inevitable but on three out of five flights we were delayed. The worst part was sitting on the tarmac in Saigon for 50 mins in heat and not being offered water. The food was awful and on a afternoon flight I asked for some juice - their reply was there's pepsi, pepsi or pepsi. Not good enough Vietnam Airlines, If you want people to visit your country show a bit more public relations."
,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City,July 2015,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,4,yes,7,"Flying on A350 aircraft, I set a high expectation which wasn't fully met after all. The cabin is spotless and roomy. Each seat is equipped with touch screen, but unfortunately entertainment is not available on short-haul flights. Food was extremely basic and no coffee or tea was served, which is even worse than my trips with them few years ago. Cabin staff is decent and the plane arrived on time. Overall a little disappointed."

Crew service was efficient, and food and drinks served was okay. The flight from SGN to KIX was on a new plane with interactive entertainment features (unfortunately not put to much use as it was a night flight) but the return flight from KIX to SGN was on an older one which only shows the same clips for everyone. Both flights on time, food was okay, and the service was good. "
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh City,July 2015,3.0,4.0,,,,3.0,4,yes,7,"Was a short flight of around 55 mins, the cabin was well kept and tidy. I do not believe drinks were offered and on such a short flight really who needs them to be. I did have a bottle of water in my carry on anyhow.

You need a registered email to purchase pre-paid baggage online. If you have booked through a travel agent they may not have registered your email address. I got caught by this and had to pay $14 per kg at check-in instead of paying much less to purchase online. The manager at the Vietnam Airlines counter handled this appallingly and it was a terrible experience.
,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,SGN-LHR,,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,3,no,2,"I was astounded to just read the last review. We have recently flown back to London on Vietnam Airlines and I have to say their business class is possibly one of the worst products out there. I read they are supposed to be bringing in new planes and not a moment too soon - the seats were malfunctioning, they are an upright angled seat type and very uncomfortable for such a long flight. Staff were polite and quite nice, but their language skills terrible - they couldn't understand most of our requests. Food is equivalent to premium economy on most airlines, and the IFE is probably also about 10 years out of date. I'm wondering if the last reviewer flew another airline? The upside of Vietnam Airlines is that their flights are really cheap!"

,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Da Nang via Hanoi,July 2015,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"My flight was cancelled without any warning, despite the airline knowing for the past 8 hours and possessing my contact information. No assistance or room and board was given. I had to pull teeth in order for them to transfer my flight to tomorrow. In general their attitude was horrific, their excuses shoddy, and their customer care non existent. I will never use this airline again."
,Boeing 777 / A330,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Sydney to Frankfurt via Ho Chi Minh City,June 2015,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,3.0,4,no,4,"We went business class with Vietnam Airlines. Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City, faultless. The B777-200 for Ho Chi Minh City to Frankfurt - the seat is not as pictured on their web site with an individual shell back. The seat was just an ordinary seat which when in the fully reclined position, made it impossible to get up from a window seat at night without waking up the person next to you. The interior is old and shabby. I got a great sleep on the A330 and almost none on the B777. They offer a layover service in Ho Chi Minh City. Someone meets you before immigration, they take your passport and arrange the visa. They transport you to a good 4-star hotel only minutes from the airport. There is nothing to do in the immediate vicinity and you need to get a taxi to downtown yourself. If your stay is long enough they offer a tour of the city. They also fed us. I was impressed with this aspect of their service. We got a good deal on the airfare but I think I will pay the extra and travel with another airline next trip."

Flights were on time, staff are fine - they just go about their job. Good food and entertainment on the international flight. Comfy seats on all flights. The best thing about them were the price of my tickets. I booked 5/6 months in advance and got great prices for a full service plane. "

The middle seat between the other passenger and me was free so it added to the level of comfort. The meal was filling and quite tasty - when you fly around Europe and get little or nothing this makes such a nice change! The cabin was quite warm. The crew did several drink runs and were always available. Would fly with them again if I was in the region.

Crew were usual grumpy and rude self, refusing to hang my suit up because that's apparently only a business class service. Chief purser had a terrible attitude and was very rude, basically ignoring me. Immediately after take off half the crew sat and relaxed in business class seats. The others passed out some water and joined them! They say they want to be a 4 star airline! I'm amazed they're even a 3 star one! "
,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Sydney to London via Saigon,June 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,1,"After reading many reviews about this airline I had a few concerns. I booked with Flight Center and was having a few issues with them about my flights. I called Vietnam Customer Service in Sydney Australia and they soon put everything right. Check in was smooth with fast track priority. The new business class lounge was excellent, had a nice foot massage. Once onboard we were warmly greeted by the crew - refreshing hand towels and champagne. Food was good, drinks were plentiful. Nothing was any trouble for the crew their English was excellent. As it was a long stopover we were taken to a hotel which was an excellent chance to shower, rest and have a meal. Ok so they are not in the same class as Emirates etc and I have flown them but for the price that you pay their service is excellent."
,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,2,no,2,"I live in Vietnam and have to fly Vietnam Airlines regularly. In their magazine they say they want to become a 4-Star airline. They are not even a 3-Star airline. I am a Platinum member but get treated as badly as all the others. There is no flight out of HCMC on time, even when the weather is good. Business Lounges are filthy and
dirty (while the staff plays with their smartphones instead to clean up the tables). Upgrades never happen. Instead, right after take off the crew brings their friends and family members into Business Class  to fill up the empty seats. On trips to Europe I try to avoid VN Airlines as much as possible. This airline needs a stronger
focus on quality and needs to start listening to their customers."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,yes,7,Flew VN780 MEL-HCMC on A330. Very good flight clean and comfortable good food staff a little grumpy but didn't worry us. Not the greatest of entertainment systems but enough to get by. I'd fly with VNA again and I recommend VNA.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,VN780 May 23rd 2015. I fly regularly from Melbourne to HCMC with this airline. The optiontown upgrade to Business class great and excellent value for money good food attentive friendly staff clean planes and lay flat bed seats. Nothing like arriving home in the morning refreshed after a good sleep. When I have to go to Vietnam I don't even consider using any other airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,6th May from LHR flight VN50. Return flight on 19th May from Hanoi flight VN55. I was very dissatisfied from the moment we entered the plane cabin staff were very unhelpful bordering on rude the plane on our outward trip was almost empty so the crew had little to do. I was expecting to have regular water or juices offered but this did not happen and on such a long flight it was needed. Delivery of food was an interruption into their rest time and the lack of English language was not good so communication was very difficult the plane was quite old and the seats very uncomfortable with very little leg room. The return flight was full so it was even more uncomfortable the service was just as bad and the screen on my seat was broken and just flashed throughout the flight. I asked the crew member for help and got a shrug and she put the magazine over the seat and that was it! I will never choose this airline again unless they improve their planes and train staff to a reasonable standard. I have never heard so many complaints by passengers on a flight before.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,We flew from Singapore to London Heathrow via Ho Chi Minh city on business class. The plane an A321 departed Singapore on time. Only 5 seats in business class were occupied. Fairly short flight and no inflight entertainment. Upon arrival in HCM we disembarked and quickly boarded a bus to the airport. We were given complimentary access to the business lounge. The flight to London Heathrow was re-timed which meant spending an extra hour in HCM. For this route the plane was a Boeing 777. Business class was half full. The interior was clean but only one toilet in business class also used by the pilot and his officers. When occupied we had to use the toilets in economy class. The meal was limited in choice. Inflight entertainment was accessed from ipad with a good selection of movies. Seats were quite narrow and not fully reclined. Service was fine with personable crew. The indirect route was a bit of a hassle but for the price we paid for business class which cost about the same as premium economy for other airlines flying direct meant it was worth the extra journey time. Boeing 777 will be replaced by new Dreamliner from London Heathrow in July 2015. Look forward to experiencing flat bed in business class on return leg.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,6,Flew from KUL to CDG Vietnam airlines use A321 for KUL-HAN route B777 for HAN-CDG route. A321 is a typical short haul flight with good meals provided no private screen IFE only overhead screen broadcast system. B777 is an old aircraft with old fashion interior a small seat back screen with NON on demand IFE means they have time schedule to broadcast the movie. On DME to KUL VN use A330-200 surprisingly this is a modern aircraft with nice interior larger seat back screen with video on demand entertainment system. Flight attendants were polite food provided was good. They even served cocktail and sparkling wines. As for amenities they only provide blanket and pillow tooth brush was placed in bathroom with minimum quantity for grabs. No duty free shopping. VN should refurbish their B777 aircraft's if they want to continue using this plane in order to compete with other 3 star airlines as it is really outdated. If you want to fly with VN and expect a bit more comfortable flying experience try to choose route using A330-200 or their newly aircraft - A350 and B787.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,Flight VN 19 from HAN to CDG in Economy seat. We bought our ticket on Air France because it's a codeshare flight. The seats config is 3-3-3 on their 777 old plane very noisy. The service was very bad not friendly at all the food was tasteless. I am very surprised that Air France which i know well for having good service can have codeshares like this. I had a look at the Business class seat and it's an extremely old version! No screen on the back. The IFE is not on demand so if you miss the start of a movie you're going to have to wait - are we back in 2000?
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,I chose this airline to travel to Europe and back from Australia as it had reasonably priced business-class fares. I had read mixed reviews but decided to give it a go. First leg Sydney to Ho Chi Minh city was in an A330 6 years old. The plane was clean and comfortable and in quite good condition. The service was attentive and friendly without being intrusive. The meals were very good and the wine list excellent mainly French. Not full lie-flat seats but close to it - enough to get a good rest. The Ho Chi Minh lounge is OK not great. Comfortable and with good stocks of beverages but the Western Food selection is minimal. Also no showers which would be a welcome addition. By contrast the Hanoi lounge is excellent with slightly better Western food selection and shower facilities. Decent standard and roomy. The flights to and from Europe are on older 777's. These do not have lie flat seats but rather the older wide seats that recline significantly. Again not bad for a rest and short sleep but not a longer deep sleep that you might get with full lie-flats. The entertainment system does not work so you are provided with ipads instead which is more than satisfactory. The selection is not as great as on Emirates Qantas or Singapore but enough to keep you occupied for the duration of the flight with not too much trouble. The 777's are about to be replaced with new 787's and A350's so this will refresh the hard offering from Vietnam to Europe and offer the latest comforts of air travel. I am inclined to book more travel with this airline to Europe once the new planes are in service. Overall I found the experience satisfying and good value for money. The service of the staff was the highlight for me coupled with good food and wine offerings.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew from KL to Frankfurt via Hanoi. It seemed like a strange detour but was the cheapest option. We were served decent meals (even on the shorter flight which was surprising) and wide selection of drinks inc. small cocktail menu sparkling wine red or white wine/beer. Note: I asked for a vegetarian meal but was told I couldn't as I hadn't specified during check in - we checked in online and there was no meal option on there. Shame. Seats in economy were wider than usual and comfortable we were going to pay for an upgrade to deluxe economy (4-5 inches more room) but once we saw the seats we didn't bother. Entertainment on long haul was small in seat screens with a good selection but all the films started at the same time so if you missed the start you had to wait for it to finish and start again. Cabin crew were really attentive and really friendly. Would certainly fly with them again. The online check-in is extremely dated and one of the oldest websites I have ever seen. If you have specific dietary/other requirements I would recommend calling them or checking in at the airport.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,,Hanoi to Danang to Hanoi. First of all the check-in was terrible - took staff about 15 min to check in each customer! One ground staff member was using her phone privately while checking in guests - not good at all! Boarded both flights with no greetings from the yawning unprofessional crew. A321 aircraft was old and uncomfortable. After the crew threw out bottles of water they disappeared to the back seats in the plane and were playing games on their phone.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,,Flew LHR to Hanoi on 10 April. 1 hour late commencing boarding and once boarded we were marooned on the aircraft at the stand for a further 2.5 hours. We were given no information at all and in Economy we were not even offered a drink or snack. We were then turfed off the aircraft and given 8 vouchers each for refreshment in the terminal. Finally re-boarded the aircraft and took off nearly 7 hours after the scheduled departure. No apology or explanation from the flight or cabin crew - disgraceful. The Captain made not one announcement during the whole time we were on the aircraft - from the initial aborted boarding through to landing in Hanoi. Ground staff at Heathrow advised us that the collision avoidance system PCB had to be replaced and sourced from another airline at Heathrow in other words an avoidable technical fault. Cabin staff were polite but distant and unfriendly - in flight meals were poor. On our return 2 weeks later (HCMC / LHR) we suffered a 1 hour delay boarding / taking off - again no apology or explanation and not one announcement from the flight crew to the passengers. Prior to landing the estimated arrival time changed by 30 minutes and we circled Heathrow a number of times before landing 1.5 hours late - no explanation or communication from the flight crew. Surly cabin staff with little or no interaction with passengers. This airline should be avoided at all costs.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,MEL-SGN VN780 21 Apr. SGN-CDG VN11 21 Apr. I don't normally travel business class but for this Europe trip we paid the extra. We flew MEL-CDG. MEL-SGN was on a A330 which was in good condition comfortable and virtually empty (there was only 4 people in business for this flight). We has access to the Qantas lounge in MEL. On arrival to SGN we were met by a tour guide who had organised a visa for us and taken to a hotel for a few hours sleep. This was organised and paid for by the airline (you have to get your travel agent to do this in advance for you). SGN-CDG was on a 777. This plane was tired but comfortable. I got to sleep quite easily again the food was excellent and the service the same. The IFE was an iPad but this worked well and had a small but good selection on it.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5,yes,8,"Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi - flight time changed 5 times. Booked a 10 am flight that finally departed at 4pm. Upgraded to Business class using ""Optiontown"". Very easy but did not include lounge access. The service was excellent the snack was more like a meal. The A321 was a little tired seat comfortable but a little worn and there was no inflight entertainment."
,,,Premium Economy,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,1,no,3,We were wary about travelling with Vietnam Airways and I have to say all our fears were confirmed. We upgraded to Traveller Plus but apart from having more leg room the conditions were unacceptable. The upholstery on flight VN51 out of HCMC was disgraceful and the toilet floor was lifting. The galley units were scratched and appeared not to fit properly. Many seats had no screens and the same films were shown on both outward and inward journeys. The crew were rude inattentive and uncooperative. We were delayed 2 hours. We will definitely not be recommending Vietnam Airways.
,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,10,Flew out from Gatwick on VN 55 on 13th March returning into Heathrow on VN 54 on 31st March. Having read comments. critics regarding Vietnam Airline I was not looking forward to our return flight to Hanoi. However our flight was excellent on time and very comfortable. Would certainly travel with this airline again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,3,Flew HCM - Sydney on 10/4/15. Despite a full plane both the toilets in the middle section were locked and unavailable for passenger use throughout the entire flight. Apparently it is not uncommon behavior from Vietnam Airlines cabin crew to do this for reasons I am not entirely certain. Constant queues at the dirty rear toilets throughout the flight. Absolutely unprofessional and unacceptable.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,VN 773 from Ho Chi Minh - Sydney. Worst airline ever. Ageing aircraft. No entertainment system on an 8hr flight was available but not working which makes you question what other upkeep and maintenance is lacking. Western food option run out with no option left. Flight late leaving late arriving with no attempt to make time up. Upon landing and bouncing on and off the runaway breathed a sigh of relief we were on the ground. Cabin crew on the upside professional and pleasant. Seats uncomfortable. Have travelled extensively throughout the world and this was the worse airline experience ever. Will not be flying Vietnam Airlines ever again!
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,9,Siem Reap to Da Nang. All economy class on this ATR turboprop service-but was fine for a 90 minute flight. Think Vietnam were the only service provider on this route so no choice really. We had a problem with our Vietnam Visa- my mistake entirely as I had put the wrong arrival date in my application-the ground staff at Vietnam Airlines Siem Reap went above and beyond to try and get approval for us to fly and ended up speaking directly with the police Chief at Da Nang airport and they got us in! Kudos to them for their efforts as our trip was about to go horribly wrong. We have flown Vietnam Airlines several times in the past (in business) and are about to fly them again tomorrow to Bangkok (in business) - was a bit worried about the economy trip but should not have been concerned. All good-but seriously their business class fares are not much more than economy so would really recommend you treat yourself!
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,5,yes,8,KUL-SGN return on Airbus A221s. Both flights were on time. Planes were clean and the seats were comfortable. No IFE on such short flights. Food and drink were very good. Great value for money. Recommended.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Paris to Hanoi 777-200. Business class flight. Very good service. Polite and attentive. Very good food. Plenty of it with drinks available on demand. Seats were not lay flat but very good recline and fully adjustable. Cabin was comfortable with lights down for much of flight for good sleep. Entertainment via Ipad provided but had good selection of movies and programs. Aircraft's were quite old and looked worn. Would recommend this company to others.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,Travelled on 27th Feb 2015 to Hanoi the plane was old food was ok. Came back on 14th March 2015 from Ho Chi Minh City leaving at 12 midnight. We were told an hour later no beef stroganoff only fish not our choice therefore no meal. We asked for a snack nuts or such like during the night as we were hungry and were told no snacks available. We were told breakfast would be served to us first which they did only to find out that people a few rows in front were informed no omelette. We have been fortunate to travel on many airlines and treated and fed brilliantly never again will we travel via Vietnam Airlines. As people before have said the majority people travelling were British. I would rate this as a 2* airlines and hope when they move to Heathrow they improve greatly for the sake of future travellers.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,,,3,no,3,Just back from Ho Ch Minh City to London on 14th March 2015. 85% of passengers were English but only 50% of meals were omelettes as in menu. Large number of passengers were only offered beef noodles not good at 4am.
,,,Premium Economy,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,no,2,Flew from Gatwick to Hanoi Premium Economy. Plane old and very tired service was acceptable food was the best I have experienced on a flight. Return flight from Hanoi to Gatwick. Plane old and very tired service was unacceptable and food was inedible. I understand that the airline is about to take delivery of new planes. Lets hope its the start of a consistent service for Vietnam Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,,,0,no,4,CXR-DAD Internal morning flight. Check-in good the usual 3 desks open processing passengers. Boarding on time and pushback about 10 minutes early arrival also 10 minutes early flight on a relatively new A321. Overall the attention to detail let down the flight and was indicative of some underlying attitudes. Cabin Crew did not appear to check everyone's seat belt was fastened prior to take-off nor stow hats and coats that emergency row passengers had placed on an empty seat. A passenger decided to get up to use the toilet just after take-off when the Fasten Seatbelt sign was still illuminated but no comments/instructions from the cabin staff to return to seat! The final point was that the seatback pockets were not cleared out after the fights or even overnight as both my travelling companion and I found old boarding passes and other rubbish stuffed in the pockets - clearly the attention to detail is missing and needs work if the airline is to be truly successful!
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,no,2,December 2014 SGN-TPE on VN570: Besides the rather warm cabin temperature everything else was relatively ok until I had to use the toilet. There was a line in the back of the plane because one toilet was locked up. When people started to ask questions probably because they got tired of the wait a crew member then unlocked that toilet and proceeded to clear out a bunch of luggage. Turns out that the flight crew was using that toilet to store their handheld luggage.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,3,yes,6,Flew from London Gatwick to Ho Chi Minh 24 January returned Hanoi to London Gatwick 9th February with 3 internal flights within that period. Long haul flights - planes dated with uncomfortable seats but attentive and polite crew. Internal flights - modern aircraft and again polite crew. If the quality of the 777's matched the staff this trip would have been good value hopefully the airline can afford to upgrade their planes soon.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,"First time to use Vietnam Airlines for a routine flight UK to Manila reason being a return flight of £475 against an average of £700 to £800 with other carriers. Also used ""Optiontown"" to bid on having the adjacent 2 seats empty two days before departure this was confirmed. Service on board was excellent friendly crew willing to go the extra mile unlike other carriers crew didn't disappear after the meal service they were always on hand. Having 3 seats to myself was a joy meaning I could lay down and get some shut eye (this for only £22"" ). my only negative would be the dated entertainment system and lack of choice other than that this airline is up there will all the other carriers in this route. Would definitely use again."
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,5,Flew LGW-HAN on 20 Jan 2015 and HCM-LGW on 4 Feb 2015. The cabin is in need of a major refurb! Cabin was clean but looked dull old fashioned seats broken controls stuck up with sellotape. Missing reading lights IFE provided with pre loaded tablets choice of food was meat and fish normally most airlines have a choice of Veg option but that was missing beverages OK coffee was one of the best I've had at 40 thousand feet? Wash rooms had minimal products of non-descript origin for use but were clean. They do not have duty free goods on the plane. cabin staff were pleasant and helpful. The only advantage is this is a direct flight from LGW to Vietnam otherwise there are choices if you are willing to take a flight from an overseas hub adding another 4-6 hours to a 12+ hours flight.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew Jan 2015 LGW-SGN-MEL. This was the return journey (see earlier post). Enjoyed the very nice lounge facilities at London Gatwick's Number 1 Lounge for four hours longer than anticipated due to a mechanical issue (a malfunctioning de-icing valve had to be replaced). This had to be sourced from Heathrow which explains the four hours. Finally the board in the lounge told us to proceed to the gate. Got there in 10 minutes but no-one was boarding. The crew hadn't arrived. We were told by the British company on the gate that they were resting in a local hotel and were only 10 minutes away. Well that ten minutes turned into an hour. We finally got away four hours late which we never caught up. Flight in the pointy end was in the old B777 which definitely needs retiring. Food and service was good had a good sleep in the 160 odd degree seats. Woke up with an hour and half to landing and were fed an OK western breakfast. We were met again at the transfer desk by a tour company representative who obtained a one day visa for us and went with us to a nice city hotel. Those Ho Chi Minh City scooters are something else! After a shower and sleep the rep met us in the lobby and took us back to the airport where he took us through immigration. Spent an hour or so in the Vietnam Airlines Lounge where we enjoyed the alcohol and massage chair. The food was OK. Boarded our flight to Melbourne on time in a much newer A330. Can't remember what I ordered from the menu but the food and drinks as well as the service was good. Slept most of the way until landing. Summary: For the price we paid over Christmas this has to be the deal of the year. Only two negatives. The long layovers in both directions in SGN and the old B777s (SGN-LGW). P.S: For sheer convenience book a room the night before your departure at LGW's Premier Inn North Terminal or the more expensive Sofitel next door and walk 100 metres into departures.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,,4,yes,8,BKK-Hanoi return Business. Lounges nothing to write about basic but as ever with Vietnamese people very friendly. All drinks some basic food but lounges look the 90/80's. On board hardwear good A321 clean fresh. Crew very friendly Food and beverage was above average and served with a smile. Landed on time no Biz class fast track for immigration so about an hour with visa. Return overall the same so would recommend!
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,19th Dec VN 772. 20th Dec VN 51. 3rd Jan VN 50. 4th Jan VN 773. I thought they were excellent! We flew from Sydney to London in Dec with our 9 month old baby. They are not completely flat beds but as we read a lot of reviews we expected that. The food was very good staff were lovely and very helpful. The plane from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh is nicer then from Ho Chi Minh to London but is still fine.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,KUL to LGW (via SGN). First time I've used Vietnam Airlines and overall I was fairly impressed. On the short KUL to SGN leg we got a pretty substantial meal of decent quality - certainly much more than many other airlines seem to offer for a sub 2 hour flight or in some cases for longer journeys than that. The A321 aircraft for this leg was also clean comfortable and fairly new looking. For the longer SGN to LGW part it was a 777 and the state of its cabin was the one negative aspect of our Vietnam Airlines experience. It looked pretty worn and it was actually less comfortable in regards leg room and seat comfort than the A321. Personally I don't really care about how good or bad the IFE is but I could see what this 777 had probably wouldn't impress passengers who do care about the IFE. In spite of those negatives I thought the service provided was really good. Again good quality meals and I found the cabin crew to be pleasant and helpful. I would not agree with other reviewers criticisms of English abilities. Granted none I came across could pass themselves off as native English speakers but they were perfectly good enough to do the job. I with zero Vietnamese ability had no problems communicating with any of them at all. So a little unfortunate I thought that their staff's good work was somewhat undermined by the less impressive state of the cabin they were working in. I should mention another positive was the transfer at SGN. I'd been warned by a friend who used to live in Ho Chi Minh City that it was a terrible airport. Indeed it was rather dated if glitzy shopping mall but it ticked the boxes that matter for me. Toilets were plentiful and all were spotlessly clean. Transit process was fast and efficient and simple food and drinks seemed much less of a rip off than many other international airports I've transferred via. Overall the pluses outweighed the minuses and I'd fly Vietnam again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,2,yes,5,Flew DAD-SGN on VN113. Two days prior to departure I received an email from the airline letting me know that the flight had been delayed 40 minutes. It was nice of them to let me know in advance as many airlines that I have previously traveled just wait to tell you at the airport. The flight itself was pleasant and comfortable. FA's just did their job and the service was okay nothing special. The only time I really saw them was during take off and landing and once to hand out complementary bottles of water. Overall the airline was better than I was expecting and got me to my destination on time yet the price was considerably higher than VietJet or Jetstar Pacific. I would still recommend Vietnam Airlines and would travel again if no cheaper alternatives.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,yes,7,After reading some of the reviews I came prepared with an inflatable cushion battery powered fan snacks and plenty of reading material! 12 pm flight from LGW. Seat was ok with enough room to stretch legs fully out managed to get some sleep so can't be too bad. Lunch/dinner served almost immediately food very average and not completely hot ordered Hake with rice got chewy Cod instead. Flight Attendants requested blinds be pulled down as they came around to collect the food trays lights went out soon after at about 3 pm. As noted before they seem to treat this as a night flight possibly for the crews benefit but judging by some chronic jetlag I suffered after arriving in Hanoi perhaps for passenger benefit too? My seatback monitor didn't work only occasionally randomly displaying flight info. Captain stated over PA they were re-booting the entertainment system made no difference I had my phone and a book so no problem. At one point I was standing at the back of the plane and could see about half of the screens were playing films. Crew were efficient if not particularly friendly makes a change from bland corporate insincere politeness! Plenty of passengers milling around at back of plane helping themselves to drinks and snacks. Toilets seemed to be all working and stocked with tissue paper and soap. Plane interior a little tired looking my armrest had gaffer tape on it. Person in front had a light that wouldn't turn off some paper was stuck over it by flight attendant. At one point I asked for a sandwich and was told they didn't have any was given a pot noodle instead which wasn't very nice later on I saw a tray of sandwiches in the galley! Surprisingly (ticket stated one meal only) we were served a hot breakfast again very average (an omelette and ham). Airline not as bad as I feared not great though would fly with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,,4,yes,7,HAN-SGN / SGN-HUI/ HUI-HAN on 17th 30th Dec. 2014 and Jan 4th 2015. All 3 flights were on Airbus 321. Good aircrafts but dull interior. First flight delayed almost 2 hours of which the second hour was just waiting on the runway prior to kickoff. Other passengers said that on this route SGN-HAN-SGN delays are normal while to/from the provinces the airline appear to be much more punctual. Service onboard is absolutely minimal. One small bottle of water handed out is not impressive while a lot of idle FA's have nothing to do. To the 2 hour flight Hanoi to Saigon a sandwich was added. Nothing can be purchased to add to food or drinks. Other flights on time a bit dull not much to report. If you provide a tea - or instant coffee sachet to the FAs they will prepare it for you and thus give you a hot paper mug of coffee/tea for free.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,,,3,yes,7,VN610 BKK-HAN with A321 window seat 26A. Everything worked as expected. The flight was on time both for departure and landing. Check-in security boarding as well as disembarkation and baggage retrieval worked without a hitch. On-board service was competent and caring. No complaints at all for Economy Class you can't do much better than that. The stewardesses were not very helpful unless you asked them to help. Service was normal with no extra smiles. There was no inflight entertainment.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Despite having 6 seats booked in business class including a black card holder (and two 80 year olds I might add) our 5.30pm flight was cancelled and we were moved to a 10.30pm one without so much as an email text or phone call. The VN airlines representative was most unaccommodating and the service was absolutely unacceptable. After numerous phone calls we were able to arrange 6 economy class seats on a 7.45pm flight: with just a 30 usd refund per ticket. Essentially we were made to pay excess baggage for our business class baggage allowance following this downgrade. As frequent flyers we of course anticipate that many delays are unavoidable however it is entirely unacceptable to not inform passengers as soon as a delay is announced especially if it is 5 hours late!
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Very similar review to a recent Australian traveller. Flew MEL-LGW via SGN. A330 on first leg to Ho Chi Minh City. Had breakfast in the Qantas business lounge in Melbourne prior to departure. That was nothing to write home about but better much better than waiting in the terminal. Boarded and departed on time. Aircraft was clean and comfortable. Hostesses were smiley polite and attentive. Lunch was served soon after takeoff and was enjoyable. Wines/spirits were topped up regularly. Arrived on time at Ho Chi Minh City for an eight hour layover (too long). Because we were travelling in business we were met at the transfer desk had a one day visa organised and were then taken on a tour of the city in a nice car (air-conditioned thankfully as it was so humid there). What an eye- opener that that journey was! There are 10000000 scooters in Ho Chi Minh City and we saw most of them on that 10 km journey. It was organised chaos. We enjoyed a free dinner in the Catina Hotel which was very nice and we were then taken on a walking tour to see the highlights of the city. We were then put in a car and returned to the airport where we were met by the same tour company representative who had our visa papers stamped (unbelievable bureaucracy in Vietnam) and we spent a couple of hours in Vietnam Airlines lounge. We were not hungry but enjoyed the whisky and soft drinks. The flight to London Gatwick left SGN a half hour late due to the late arrival of the incoming flight. This flight was on an older Boeing 777. We were dog-tired by then and fell asleep very soon after takeoff. We were served an adequate breakfast an hour or so before landing at Gatwick. The IFE doesn't work so they hand out Ipads but we slept. The seats were comfortable with plenty of legroom. Summary: At over half the price of the likes of Singapore Qantas Emirates etc. Vietnam Airlines represents very good value. My only negative is that the connections at SGN were too long despite being given the free city tour hotel meal a sleep in a hotel room on the return journey etc. Would go with them every time at the price I paid.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Excellent experience and am very happy to recommend. Flew round trip from Gatwick to HCMC and also took an internal flight during travels using this airline. Very smooth flight tasty food latest films. Slept 8 hours + both ways. Staff friendly. Really good value for money.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,6,VN630 CGK-SGN 22 December 2014. Flight was almost full and departed CGK on time. No welcome drinks were offered only packaged wet towels. No individual IFE screens. The plane (A321) offered generous seat pitch and my seat was comfortable albeit understandably worn out. Lunch was served immediately after take-off. FAs were generally friendly but it seemed their English capability was quite limited. The highlight of the flight had to be the fragrant and delicious Vietnamese coffee that was served on-board! Overall I had a pleasant experience with VN.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Business Class - Vietnam Airlines - Melbourne to HCM. Business Priority Check In Immigration Express Pass Access to Qantas Business Lounge via Voucher Priority Boarding Seating approx. 60% capacity in business with seating to the same standard as any other carrier - lie flat bed universal power points USB point IFE with a decent selection. Food and drinks service was excellent. If you want additional drinks or snacks after the main service all you have to do is press the call bell. Throughout the radio channels they remind you to do this. Business Class - Lounge Access - HCM. Lounge is easy to find and very welcoming. Its usually very quiet. Reasonable range of hot and cold snacks a make your own noodle bar and a few local food options. Toilets but no shower facilities. Most seats are big and comfy with their own power sockets and good selection of books and magazines. Lighting is a little harsh at night. Great selection of spirits and wines. Flights are announced and screens are available to check times. A quiet corner also has a massage chair for use. Its a decent lounge but after a two or three hours you will be over it. Business Class - Vietnam Airlines - HCM to London Gatwick (via Germany). These planes are older and a lot more worn out. Don't expect the same standard as the Australia flights. The seats recline well and they are very comfy but there is no power on this plane no usb sockets the IFE is unusable so they give you an iPad instead. No privacy screens. Food and drink service is excellent and staff were extremely accommodating when asked for additional wine spirits or snacks. On a couple of occasions I asked for a snack and wine and I was given a sample platter and even had my wine topped up without prompt. The stop over in Germany is seamless and pretty quick. I flew back to Melbourne from Paris via HCM. In Paris its a very confusing process to check in. This has nothing to do with Vietnam its just the way the airport is designed. Boarding was good with easy priority for business customers. Plane was again about half full. Transit Tour in HCM. Vietnam Airlines ran a special promo for long stop overs where I was met at HCM transit zone by my tour guide. They sort out your visa and escort you through the whole process. Overall Vietnam Airlines do not do themselves any favours - their website is dull and does not go to much lengths to show off the good service they provide in reality. I was pleasantly surprised with how good the whole process was and how good business class is in Vietnam Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,4,yes,7,Flew Hong Kong-Hanoi end of November. Aircraft a very well turned out A321. Seats comfortable enough. My colleague wanted an aisle seat with extra legroom (due to a leg injury) so we sat in a two seat exit row at the back which gave me a window seat - with no window! Flight attendants very smart in their traditional costumes and were attentive throughout the two hour flight. Food Vietnamese and gave me a taste of the delights to come in Vietnamese food. I watched only the moving map display on the seat back IFE so cannot comment on the programming. All told a very acceptable flight.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,4,yes,8,Very pleasantly surprised. Flew REP-HAN/HAN-DAD. Planes (all A321) are modern and fresh. The FAs are welcoming and despite the language barrier (expected) communications are clear and polite. Although no IFE the short trips are passed easily. The seats are the old style of Business Class. A little hard however plenty of room. The service on board is exemplary. The inflight meals have been tasty and fresh (mix Western and Vietnamese) and they are old school in actually wanting to pour more wine (decent French wines). On 2 flights they even did the old school trick of holding economy in place until Business class had collected their overhead luggage and walked from the plane. All in all above expectations.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew from Shanghai to HCMC. I had never flown Vietnamese Airlines before but was pleasantly surprised. The inside of the cabin was amazingly clean and the seats were very comfortable. The service was excellent as well. The food was good but not great. Where the flight was lacking is in the entertainment area. You only had the option of watching what was showing on the overhead screen. That didn't matter to me though since I bring my own entertainment on my tablet.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,no,1,VN231 outbound and VN272 return. Vietnam is perhaps one of the most enchanting countries in Asia I have yet to experience yet Vietnam Airlines leaves very little to be desired - and it has everything to do with the small details from all areas ranging from their print media / safety on board video to the ever so important quality of customer service. Service in the airport and during the flight - lack of willingness to help perceived as aggressive - not customer oriented or empathetic to the needs of the customer. Food quality - Average/Normal in quality and variety. Not necessarily a critical element at this stage as there are other more significant issues at hand. Communications/Language - Poor. For an international airline this is perhaps one of the poorest airlines I have experienced in terms of listening and communicating English to international guests.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Singapore-Hanoi-Singapore in late November. Completed on-line check-in and only had to drop off luggage at Changi Airport T3 (which was handled very efficiently). Boarding was organised and flight departed Singapore on time. There is minimal inflight entertainment on the A321s that operate on this route - there are audio channels you can tune in to as well as some short TV programmes on Vietnam but there are also newspapers on offer when you board. Cabin service on the Singapore-Hanoi flight was good crew did their job efficiently and one steward even happily refilled our water bottles at our request. The two meal choices were good and drink service was conducted twice during the flight. Seat pitch was good at 32 inches and very comfortable. Flight arrived in Hanoi on time and bags were on the belt 20-25 minutes after disembarkation. For the return to Singapore check-in in the morning was a bit chaotic with hundreds of passengers queuing - you can avoid this situation if you do web check-in. Boarding was orderly and the flight departed on time. The lunch was better on the return leg and the cabin crew were friendlier this time round. Once again this was an A321 so no PTVs and only audio channels were available. Arrival into Singapore was on-time and bags were on the belt in under 20 minutes. Price is very good and service was also above my expectations - I look forward to flying them again soon.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,4,Flew from Gatwick to Saigon on 1 November 2014 lunchtime flight many seats could not be put upright as they were old and not maintained the plane was far too hot and the entertainment system broken. Food was fine on way out although the choice of drinks was poor. Lights were turned out after the first meal even though it was early afternoon. We had no offer of further drinks and we had to go and collect any water we required. Staff were rude and pushed past people shoving them without saying anything. On the way back from Hanoi on 21 November 00.10 to Gatwick the seats were the same two toilets were out of order when we got on the food was not very good at all and we were only offered one drink and some water until breakfast on a 13 hour flight. Choice of drinks poor and they were all from plastic bottles. The staff on this plane were much nicer but I had to ask for the toilets to be replenished with towels as they were not checking these on a regular basis which was critical when the flight had less toilets. I was on a package tour so did not choose this airline and I consider these are the worse long haul flights I have taken. However the flight from Siem Reap to Luang Prabang and the flight back to Hanoi were good small planes with only 68 passengers.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,2,no,,Gatwick to Saigon return. Entertainment consoles not working. Food ran out and pot noodles unacceptable alternative. Staff didn't speak English very well. Several internal flights which were good and staff spoke English very well. Long haul to be avoided but internal flights recommended.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,,,4,yes,7,Domestic Hanoi-Dalat-Hanoi 22-25 November 14. Good hardware (all flights Airbus 321) lounges well equipped with soft drinks and beers. Other alcoholic drinks available but completely substandard. Food mediocre but options prevailed. Check in smooth efficient and call buttons on board answered within 4-8 seconds. Food onboard unbearable forget these ugly Western cold snacks. No hot dishes and no options but one useless plate of white bread sandwich which has no market neither within nor outside Vietnam - a scandal for the country. Staff alert polite limited English. IFE working but no handset speakers given. Only one terrible US entertainment movie shown. Priority embarking and disembarking - a lot of courtesy from FAs but all in all very conservative quiet experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,LGW to HCMC - Sydney and return. Good flights on all routes pleasant staff at all times. Food was good and overall a good experience good value for money and will use again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,Flight was Sydney to Ho Chi Minh - Qantas flight on Vietnam Airlines. It was a normal economy flight comfortable enough. Watched a movie and there was a reasonable selection. It didn't provide the entertainment range of other airlines but it was enough for me. As a Qantas gold FF I had priority luggage but my bags were last off. Did a domestic flight for one hour and it was also good. Doing the red eye flying home so going business class. Price is quite good so it will be interesting to see how comfortable the seats are.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew London to Hanoi and Saigon to London both in business. As a counter to some of the negative reviews both flights were excellent. Sure the cabin felt a bit tired and there was no lie flat bed but food and drink were good and plentiful and service both ways particularly the return was incredibly attentive. The entertainment was limited. Outbound we were offered iPads which were far superior to the armrest screens on the return. Nice touches included dedicated business class buses to and from the aircraft. All in all I had an excellent experience. If you go expecting something comparable to one of the five star airlines you may be disappointed but it was good value and will happily travel with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,We travelled Gatwick to Hanoi Saigon to Gatwick (with a few internal flights in between). The internal flights were short and were acceptable. The long haul flights both ways were terrible. The attendants were miserable and did their job begrudgingly. The food was appalling - both Asian and European. We spent the whole flight hungry with only the offer of a pot noodle or a roll and butter not substantial for a 12 hour flight. We would never use Vietnam Airlines or recommend them to anyone. We have travelled many airlines including the low cost airlines and have never experienced such a poor service.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,,,5,yes,7,Saigon to Hue and Danang Saigon. Both legs on A321s and the interiors were lovely shades of blue and green and the seating comfort was fine. On the first flight early in the morning they offered a cup of water to each passenger. On the return we each got a bottle of water. Pretty skimpy catering especially for an early morning flight. Crews served water well and that was about it. Price competitive with LCCs and no extra charges. Both flights on time.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Flying to VN from MEL was fantastic. It was an 8 hour flight and I was able to sleep comfortably. The food was ok. The entertainment was fantastic although it would have been better if they have added more kids / family movies. The staff service was marvellous and the bathroom toilets were also clean and had no problems. Overall fantastic flight good entertainment and amazing comfort. I highly recommend Vietnam Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,3,We did a few flights both domestic and international. The domestic planes are more comfortable than the international! Business class on short trips (1hr) is nice but really not all that different. Save your money. As for international I would not fly economy again if at all. Definitely spend the extra $$ and be comfortable for an almost 9 hr flight (Melb - Saigon). We were flying on Qantas flights on a VA plane. The staff are surly but it's no wonder. The planes are filthy and old and there is no fresh air in the cabin. After 9 hours the cabin reeks and someone vomiting didn't help but no fresh air? First drinks are ok but then on the second round you get Pepsi water or juice. Out of a big bottle. So hygiene? No amenity kits at all- not even an eye mask. Extremely poor food. Now I know why people fly the other airline. With 2 weeks between flights there was no difference in entertainment and choices are very limited.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,yes,5,MEL-SGN-CDG and return. We decided to try Vietnam Airlines as they offered Australia to Europe flights at a significantly lower price to other airlines I've used in the past. We got what we paid for and nothing more. Note that Australia and Europe flights aren't timed to connect with each other which means a 16 hour layover in each direction. This worked out well as we were able to exit the airport stay at a nearby hotel and freshen up before the connecting flight while our bags remained in transit. The only problem with this is you need to purchase apply for a visa before leaving MEL which can up to 140 AUD on top of the fare. The MEL-SGN flights on the A330 were fine however the 777-200 on the SGN-CDG leg is looking very tired. The seat back IFE is limited and works in channels rather than on demand. Most of the cabin crew could not speak much English. The food out of MEL and CDG was okay but the food out of SGN was terrible. Would fly with Vietnam Airlines again once they begin 787 flights.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,,,3,no,4,Flew from Paris to Taipei via SGN. The flight was late leaving CDG without explanation and passengers were still boarding when the scheduled departure time came and went. The flight was an hour and half late getting to SGN and there were several passengers at risk of missing their connecting flight. While the plane was still taxiing on the runway the flight attendants took passengers with urgent connections up to the front for quicker disembarkation but without announcing to the rest of the passengers. Most other passengers began to get up and grab their bags and took the flight attendants over 5 minutes to start telling everyone to remain seated.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,3,no,4,There was no entertainment on the way out on 3rd Oct 10.10am flight Gatwick and on my return on the 17th 10.15pm from Saigon - still no entertainment and I was not the only one where the screens did not work. Please service your equipment over 10 hours with no music or films can be very boring.
,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,2,no,4,Vietnam airline is one of the cheapest airlines to fly from Paris to Cambodia but the quality is bad. We did an upgrade to premium economy with my kid. The lights and TV entertainment worked the first hour and then it was dark until the end. The staff couldn't do anything as the flight was full. There was no space in the lounge area to benefit from any light. So 10 hours flight with no light to read a book or TV of any kind is a bit much for an adult let alone with the kid. I felt a bit ripped off and I am crossing my fingers really hard for my flight back to Paris in December where I will surely stick to the economy class. The service is basic as is the food.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,Very impressed with level of service Hong Kong to Hanoi Food excellent esp seafood staff friendly and professional. Flight on time out and return. Very good ticket price.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,SYD-SGN-CDG and LGW-SGN-SYD. Legs to/from Sydney A330. SGN-Europe on 777-200. All flights landed on time. I found the seats comfortable and was able to sleep on most legs. Food was plentiful although not 5-star. Crew attentive. As previously mentioned lounge at SGN very basic. On the return leg the day stay in the Ho Chi Minh hotel is a big bonus. The only real negative which must be addressed by the airline is the very old business class seating on the 777. On my flight from LGW/FRA 3 seats did not recline and as the cabin was full resulted in three (understandably) very disgruntled passengers. It is simply not good enough to pay the large business class premium for a broken seat for 12 hours (and not fair on the crew either who bore the brunt of it).
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,5,yes,8,I found the poor reviews on business class flights quite unfounded. We travelled from Sydney to London and found the trip excellent value for money. The service and food was excellent. The seats on the second leg were older style and not the shell style on the first leg but were still comfortable. The seats do not recline to 180 but are close enough that it doesn't matter. I could still sleep on my side and that is key for me. The lounge used in Sydney is Qantas and is great the lounge in Ho Chi Min is average. Compared to other business class seats and lounges yes Vietnam is behind the others however for the price you should compare to premium economy as that is the price you pay. In which case this airline is way ahead for me for value for money.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,no,2,Kuala Lumpur to Ho Chi Minh onward to Nha Trang 20th February. After flying constantly with this airline around South Asia their flight timings changed. Ground staff and flight staff give the poorest service of any airline. Safety briefing often stops and is not continued. The airline lounges are of poor quality are dirty and staff are unhelpful. Try and find a better airline.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,,3,yes,8,HUI-HAN on 18/9/2014. Flight (Airbus 321) on time. Lounge access in Hue smooth. Check-In only allowed 2 hours before departure at times very annoying. Lounge very conservative and food uninteresting. 2 beers no wines only soft drinks coffee tea milk etc. On board the product is very correct stable but boring and colour-less. Food has not been changed in more than 5 years – only a useless Western snack but nicely decorated and served on china with steel tools. Soft drinks and two beers available. Staff alert. Newspaper given. Seats are spacious comfortable and real business class seats in 2x2 configuration as compared to 3x3 in economy.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,,,5,yes,7,We fly to Saigon twice a year on average for family visits. Things are a lot better with the direct flights from Gatwick. Things are a bit hit and miss - some crews are really good others can be like prison wardens. This crew was good and the drinks and food kept coming. Seats in economy in the Boeing 777s are starting to show their age and the inflight entertainment jammed which meant 12 hours of Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks in the film about Disney being shown three times back to back with it proving impossible to switch the seatback screen off. It was on time. On these flights what you don't need is a crew that serves dinner at top speed misses pre dinner drinks then vanishes to the crew rest area for10 hours which is what happened on the return flight. Best thing is to book the upgrade option to Premium Economy through OptionTown.com. we did that in the past and it's brilliant. Unfortunately we were too late this time.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,I travelled from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh city and connected with the flight to Gatwick. The cost on this airline was several hundred less than others and I boarded in Melbourne as I could not get the same deal in Adelaide where I live. I have been on several carriers and Vietnam Airlines did a splendid job on the both flights. My only concern was the clarity of the announcements on board and the same at Ho Chi Minh airport. I would travel with them again without hesitation - don't take any notice of negative reviews. I had doubts before leaving Australia but was pleasantly surprised.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,,5,yes,7,SIN-LGW via SGN. I booked my trip back to UK on Vietnam Airlines because it was around 250GBP cheaper than any other airline expect Jet Airways which had poor layover times. Overall the experience on Vietnam Airlines is average not poor nor great. A lot of people on here have given awful reviews of the airline and some of it is valid. The aircraft are unclean the inflight entertainment is poor and dated the seat is rock solid however this is in context when comparing to 5&4 star airlines which command much higher prices. Given the fact that I was saving 250GBP (30%) I was more than happy to except a slightly lower quality service. Personally rated the food actually above that of a recent Emirates long haul flight I took. The flights were on time and the crew acted in a safe and polite manner. I would recommend this airline if its prices are greater than 20% below others for long haul if they are the same its clear that a more mainstream 4-5 star airline would be the better choice.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Always a pleasant experience on Vietnam Airlines. My son and I have flown them from Bangkok to Hanoi and on to Hong Kong. Then from Vientiane to Phnom Penh and on to Ho Chi Minh City. Last year from HCMC to Nha Trang and return. Then this last July from HCMC to Da Nang return and on to Taipei. They even upgraded us on that one for whatever reason. All these flights were reasonably on time courteous staff in flight and on the ground no lost luggage and very clean. Not only would I fly them again I would give them a preference. It's easy to book on- line on their website with lots of pricing choices. One of our favorites.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Return leg Hanoi to LGW 1 Aug 14. Dreading this flight due to the seats on the outward flight so I will deal with this first what a difference this seat was 56A (VNA149) much better support and a foot rest so the gamble is the plane you are flying on. IFE worked but dated and limited due to films on the outward leg (feedback from children). Crew were again very good and attentive and food (why do you get offered a meal at 2 am how about a snack and a decent breakfast) was good although ran out of my choice but the alternative Viet breakfast was excellent. A passenger emergency was handled very well on the flight. All in all I feel for VN they have been let down hugely by the late delivery of the new Boeing 787 and we the customer have suffered. I will gladly look forward to flying them again and if all is well on a new plane with a service that I feel will be up with the likes of SAA and Emirates.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,8,SGN-DAD return both legs with well maintained A321. Plane has good legroom but monitors only for safety video after that disappear. For over one hour domestic flight it's still bearable. Only one bottle of mineral water provided I thought I would have received snack refreshment as this is full service carrier and flight is over 1 hour. VN needs to work it out to achieve 4 star level and catch up with its ASEAN peers.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,0,no,3,Gatwick to HCM. The seats were old and most of the individual lights were missing as was ours. My seat's footrest would not raise fully my wife's would not fully retract so sleep was not a serious option. The entertainment system did not work so we were given ipads. The earphones were not compatible with these so the sound was inaudible. The Business class toilets did not work from the outset so these had been barred from use. My overhead reading light and the hostess call button part of the entertainment system controls did not work as the cord was fractured. Obtaining the hostess was only by walking into the cabin between business and economy. So for 12 hours: No sleep no video with sound no light for reading and no hostess to assist me attending the economy toilet during a period of severe turbulence. Oh and water regularly dripped from the ceiling. The staff were grumpy and never got one food order right. We chose Business Class because we felt that our age we needed some comfort. Big mistake.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,We travelled from London Gatwick to Ho Chi Minh and find that our apprehensions after reading some negative reviews were groundless. We were in economy but the food and beverages kept flowing through the night. The crews may not be eloquent in English but the service can be compared to that of Singapore and Emirates Airlines! They were able to keep our two boys entertained helping them to behave and were very helpful with the bassinet. Looking forward to another great time on our way back to London on August 1!
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,Had read these reviews beforehand and was incredibly worried about taking a 12 hour journey with this airline but as all multi stop options took 30 hours plus we decided to bite the bullet. Completely exceeded expectations really attentive crew meals were wonderful free instant noodles and sandwiches were a nice amenity toilets were fine planes were fairly modern and entertainment kept us thoroughly entertained. It's obviously not Emirates but I don't know what a lot of the reviewers on this we're expecting. If you have a bit of a delicate derrière I would advise bringing a cushion (I was fine on the way there but after a few days of long bus journeys the way back was a bit of a long sit).
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,no,7,LGW to SGN VN50 16/7 flight an hour late leaving due to a security alert looking at what happened on the same routing the next day fine by me. Back to the flight IFE worked at every other seat apart from mine unbelievable they tried to fix it without any luck so back to tablet I had with me. Meals were all fine hot and all the selections were available inflight snacks nice treats soft drinks were offered several times and drinks where available throughout. Apart from the worst seat in flying history 13 hours in the next best thing to a park bench is beyond a joke after ramming pillows and blankets at the back of the seat so as to be close to the overhead locker I really say no more I am not looking forward to the return leg. I would like to think this is work in progress and the only reason I couldn't recommend the airline is the cost to health services round the world who will have to pick the bill for damaged backs.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,,,2,no,1,I flew to Gatwick from Ho Chi Minh City the flight took 13 hours. The whole flight was a nightmare due to a 3 year old child screaming blue murder for the whole of the flight. The stewards and stewardess and parents made no real attempt to deal with problem to the discomfort of everybody in that particular section of the aircraft. Why is it not possible for passengers to seek compensation from the airlines for having to endure a nightmare experience similar to the one I endured along with my fellow passengers?
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew MED to SGN and return in Business Class. Staff Service Food and Flight were excellent. We have flown Singapore Malaysian and Thai Business class prior to this and the whole experience with Vietnam Airlines was up there with them. We will definitely travel Vietnam Business Class again. Highly Recommended.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,,On our way back from our tour through Vietnam on flight VN773 we experienced lots of problems. The entertainment system was not working they changed our seats and when we asked for coffee we were told there were none. Very poor salty breakfast without coffee or tea. Toilet floor full of water and no toilet paper.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,no,4,Flew from HKIA to Hanoi to Paris and back again. The HK to Vietnam routes were decent with newer planes and ample leg room service was also great. On the way to Paris however the planes were older with less leg space and hard as rock seats. To make it worse cabin temperature was increased I have never been warm on a plane before and it made for an uncomfortable 13 hours. Service wasn't the best either there weren't enough menus for everyone. Food was alright. Inflight entertainment system was something to be desired bring movies or books. Basically you get what you pay for a bargain. Will probably fly them again for shorter routes but will stay away from the longer hauls.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,SGN-SYD. This flight was part of an itinerary from Paris to Sydney. Vietnam Airlines offers a free transit program to eligible ticket holders (you need to book it 72 hours beforehand) - which we used and strongly recommend - we had a 14 hour transit between flights - we were met when we got off the plane and our visas were arranged we were then taken to an inner city hotel and had lunch and dinner and a tour of the city and then we were taken back to airport. It was a very pleasant way to spend the day and a nice break between the flights - also there was no extra money to pay and it took care of the hassle of organising a Vietnam visa. The A330-200 flight was half an hour late (all the flights I have taken out of SGN have been late) and was about 40% full in business class which was just as well because we had problems with three seats - entertainment not working necessitating multiple seat changes. Food was acceptable (not as good as the SYD-SGN leg) but the champagne was nice no refills were ever offered but the friendly staff responded quickly to the call button. The seat doesn't go completely horizontal but is pretty comfortable and sleep was possible. Entertainment options were pretty much limited to a reasonable selection of movies and not much else. No priority card given for customs/security at Sydney airport. Overall the flight went quickly and I was comfortable enough. I will fly Vietnam airlines again.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,NRT to SGN on A330-200. I had a very enjoyable flight from Tokyo to Ho Chi Minh City. The crew were very friendly and helpful. When using the call button one of the crew members came in just a few seconds. The Japanese Meal was delicious and more than enough. The IFE on the A330 is some ways better than the IFE on the B777 of VNA but also with a small selection - but for the 6-hours-flight it was ok. The seats are comfortable enough for this 6-hour flight during the day (for a night flight it may be not so comfortable though the seats are not lie flat).
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,Flew from Ho Chi Minh City to Da Nang last week never have I seen such disorganization at the airport. Flight was delayed no less than 3 times and we lost a day of our holiday sitting at the airport. Scores of their flights had gate changes and totally no communication with passengers waiting. Very disappointed with service on the flight. Will never fly with them again.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,5,Flew Business Class FRA-BKK via HCMC. B777 (FRA-SGN) and A321 (SGN-BKK) Positive points flights were all on time crew friendly and welcoming toilets were kept clean. Transfer Counter at SGN very efficient. Negative points for bland tasteless food lacking completely in presentation along with tiny wine glasses. The fantastic cuisine that Vietnam is famous for did not reflect in the catering. The entertainment system wasn't worth watching. Poor selection of films. The seats are not lie flat but I was aware of that beforehand. Did manage to get some rest even though it wasn't the most comfortable of seats. The aircraft interior looks shoddy and needs refurbishing. VN has the potential to become a better airline but they appear to be cutting costs in all the wrong areas. They totally lack the finesse that their competitors in the rest of S.E. Asia offer.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,5,yes,8,SGN-CDG B777-200. Efficient transfer desk at HCMC but very basic lounge with no shower. Disappointed on boarding to see it was a very old plane with recliner seating in 2-3-2 configuration. Flight 80% full. Food very tasty - supper and breakfast served all choices available in spite of being at the back of the cabin. Although disappointed by recliners managed to get about 9 hours sleep (was very tired) - the seats are not flat but they are well padded and quite wide. No drink refills offered but call button answered promptly and requests taken care of. The plane was extremely hot for the first 6 hours of the flight. Very limited collection of new release movies and nothing else on entertainment system.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,SYD-SGN A330. Efficient and friendly check-in at Sydney airport. Qantas lounge a nice place to have breakfast and a drink prior to boarding. Cabin 50% full. Seat is 160 degree pitch capsule and quite comfortable. Food was genuinely tasty and 2 meals served on an eight hour flight. Drinks were offered - nice champagne but glass never refilled without using call button to request. Attendants rarely seen out of meal service times but responded quickly to call button and immediately carried out all requests. In flight entertainment included about 10 new release movies and very little else - don't count on being entertained by this for the whole flight. A note - if you have an extended stop over (and wish to exit the airport) or are transferring to a domestic flight (including Saigon to Hanoi for an international connection) you will need to arrange a visa beforehand there are no visas on arrival and Saigon airport offers little in the way of distractions. Overall this was a pleasant flight and represented very good value for money.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,no,1,Myself and my family flew Vietnam airlines twice in April 2014 first leg from Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City and return about a week later. The flight from Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City was fine. Nice staff at check in on time and ok meal what you would expect from a 1.5 hr flight. However I can not say the same thing about the return leg. It started at check-in flew an early morning flight around 7am first thing that surprised me was the disorganisation at the check in area! There were 2 Vietnam airlines flights checking in and they had no lines to tell you where to stand for what flight. We lined up and waited after a 20 min wait we finally got to the front of the counter and the next minute it was closed. No word from the check in staff the check in woman just got up and walked away. The rest of the flight went on time and arrived safely in Singapore. I think the biggest thing from this is that Vietnam airlines really need to take a look at their airport customer services in Ho Chi Minh City and if you are going to have staff working at an international airport then a stranded level of English should be the required.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,,,3,no,5,On our trip from Melbourne to HMC we were highly impressed with the service and the food etc. Within Vietnam we were very happy with our flights and service. On our return flight from HMC to Australia the service was ok but the food was awful.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,yes,7,I took 2 VN flights (BKK-HAN and HAN-SGN) during the past few days. Flight to HAN: We experienced lots of turbulence during the flight yet the pilot managed to land the plane smoothly. Flight to SGN: it was quite spacious for a domestic flight yet the cabin crew should be more assertive in reprimanding the passengers who didn't obey the flight safety instructions. The in-flight entertainment didn't work but the magazine provided was quite entertaining. Should provide wider selection of in-flight meals.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,5,DAD-HAN-LGW-SGN-DAD: for once the flights were on schedule which is an unusual circumstance for VN. The flights and service were reasonable although the B777 is showing distinct signs of age. The worst aspect of the trip was the awful Bus Class lounge at SGN and the appalling scrum for immigration at HAN. The food on the return trip from LGW was considerably better than for the HAN/LGW sector and they know how to run a Bus Class lounge at LGW maybe VN should send their staff there for training. I chose VN for the sake of convenience but I will certainly look at other options next time. I should add that I would not like to have travelled in the Economy section. The seats looked cramped and I overheard some uncomplimentary remarks while waiting at SGN immigration.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,4,yes,7,Flew recently between Hanoi - Siem Reap - Hong Kong. Perfectly adequate with newish Airbus A321 aircraft decent legroom and good punctuality. Short trips so no entertainment etc. A snack was served which was basically a sandwich and a dessert; not great. Not much was expected. The cabin crew were fine although a little passive when fellow passengers were clearly ignoring instructions during take-off and landing. My main issue (which would lead me to recommend only with caution) is the number of times our flight times and numbers were changed. We did receive one notification of a schedule change but the flights we actually ended up on did not match the info. provided. Other passengers reported the same issue. Basically don't make onward/connecting plans which rely on accurate timings and flight numbers.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,0,no,4,I've flown many times domestic with VN and two intercontinental legs. For domestic flights VN is a fairly good option. Interiors look a bit worn and seats are not too comfy but for the 1-2 hr flights it is ok. Another story for the inter continental legs. I've flown in their 777. I can't judge about the technical state of the planes but if their maintenance is done like the cleaning it won't be good at all! The planes are dirty and IFE outdated (personal screens but no AVOD). Little legroom due to huge IFE boxes under most seats and safety checks prior to take off and landing are very poor. The food isn't the best I have had onboard airplanes. If I can avoid this airline in future I will!
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,3,no,2,Sunday 20 April 2014 flight VN017 Hanoi to Paris. The main areas where improvement is needed are: (1) cleanliness of toilets (very poor) and ensuring that basic hygiene is maintained such as by providing soap for handwashing (2) seat comfort - there is very little leg room for a 6 ft tall person and a media/entertainment box is installed under every seat cutting the space for feet in half and (3) food quality which was poor my hot meals were served almost cold and the replacement that I asked for was barely lukewarm. Incidentally I had the same problem of finding no soap in the toilet and generally filthy toilets on a flight to Australia in 2002 and nothing really seems to have changed in 12 years. Staff didn't seem to care.
,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,,"LGW to Hanoi on flight VN54 departed 4th April. Returned Saigon to LGW on flight VN51 departed 19th April. Awful airline which I booked despite the very mediocre reviews because of the direct flights from Gatwick. On our outward journey - on a fully laden plane - there ended up with one working WC apparently a ""waste management problem"". Booked Deluxe Economy - wish hadn't bothered - very little difference food (awful) same as economy. Staff on the outbound flight were extremely grumpy and didn't smile. Inward much better. Don't do it book with another airline."
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,5,yes,8,HUI-SGN. 17th April 2014 on an Airbus 321. Flight on time. New Business Class lounge at Phu Bai has a very disappointing boring design just a squared room and some industrial snacks plus some drinks. Only advantage is the view to the runway and a printer. The printer didn't work but the staff took the trouble to print out for me at VN counters downstairs. A funny complete nuisance is a compulsory bus drive from gate to aircraft hardly 20 meters. This goes for arrival as well departure and creates a lot superfluous efforts waiting and hassle in an airport where it is rare to see more than one aircraft at a time. The flight was full but service was on par. Newspapers handed out. A cold meal and drinks were offered (inc. 2 kinds of beer). A ring on the bell was addressed within seconds. Service began instantly after seat belts could be loosened and went on until touchdown. For a flight of 70 minutes duration the onboard service went on for 60 minutes quite impressive and better than most other carriers. Full business class seats in 2x2 configuration (compared to 3x3 in economy class). Priority luggage a joke and arrived as the latest but within 15 minutes which is tolerable. Annoying checks of luggage tags when leaving the terminal. The product offers very good value for money as the additional cost of business class travel compared to an economy is very reasonable.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,VN51 Saigon to Gatwick 12/04/2014. Old aircraft and very dirty inside - tray table ingrained with dirt ceiling splashed with food food splashed on side wall floor dirty seat pocket had debris inside toilet not cleaned and sink area dirty. Safety video shown before everyone seated and very little safety checking done prior to take-off and landing. One 300ml bottle of water given out on a 13hr flight small orange juice obtained from passing cabin crew but the tray wizzed down the aisle so fast we nearly missed it. It was very hot in the cabin throughout the journey. No bar service prior to supper. Food poor. Two internal flights with this airline were delayed for up to 4 hours.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,5,yes,8,SGN-HUI March 2014. Airbus 320. The pleasure by travelling business compared to economy on domestic is worth the modest additional payment as it allows for very fast check in and fast track: it took me less than 5 minutes in the crowded SGN airport to inscribe luggage check-in be issued lounge access card and pass the security fast lane. For economy typically 20-50 minute queue. The Lounge is darkish and has no shower nor champagne. Otherwise it is old classic and pleasant though resembles a relic from the eighties. The flight to HUI was delayed 2 hours due to a technical problems. The way VN handled this was very professional: I was informed by email on the delay 1 hour and 40 minutes prior to scheduled departure! VN pro-actively contacted me in the VN-business class lounge and informed me clearly. A staff member gave me two fair options: either accept the delay by VN or go with an earlier competing airline. I then decided to change to the competing airline VietjetAir to go on the initially scheduled time. I then accepted a downgrade as VietjetAir do not have business class. Further I would have to leave transit to sort out refund by VN-Airlines and to purchase ticket and check-in with VietjetAir. I decided to take the trouble. There was quite some risk and hassle involved as I was due to pay a hefty prize for overweight and for last Minute purchase to VietjetAir who has no co-operation with VN: I had to leave transit reclaim inscribed luggage re-pack and reshuffle luggage as to comply with VietJetAir strict requirements. The ticket price was negotiated by my VN facilitator to become the same as for the stretch SGN-HUI as for VN airlines in business. I paid at VietjetAir counter and checked in. Later I had to fill forms to reclaim at VN airlines what they owed me. I am all in all impressed it was doable. As for VN it only cost them my lounge access and the staff service. So it turned up to be a win/win situation. The trip SGN to Hue went well and I was seated like a pave getting all six front row seats though further back the flight was packed. Luggage were out when entering the terminal. Two Minutes later I was on the city coach from Airport. On time.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,Bargain of the century-we took Vietnam Airlines from Singapore to Hanoi and have 2 internal flights with them before heading back to Singapore from HCMC. For the price you cannot complain at all-nice new and clean planes (A321) smart friendly staff reasonable food and good choice of drinks. Compared to European airlines (I fly BA a lot shorthaul) there is no comparison-Vietnam win hands down. Business class fares so unbelievably reasonable to.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Early February I booked two return flights for myself and my wife. Outward leg 13/4/14 Bangkok to Danang via HCMC return 20/4/14 Danang to Bangkok via Hanoi. As of today 7/4/14 various sectors have been re-scheduled four times the last change was a cancellation of the entire Danang to Bangkok flight. We were put on flights to Bangkok via HCMC but this would have meant a 7.5 hour layover in HCMC. Out of sheer frustration I cancelled all the flights and will go elsewhere. This would have been our first flight with VA needless to say it will be the last as VA could not give an adequate explanation for the changes.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,4,yes,8,VN662 on 1 April from Singapore to Hanoi and VN661 from Hanoi to Singapore on 5 April travelling business class both ways. I have to say the staff were great on both legs always checking and always present. The food was great and served quickly along with refresher towels and plenty of water. The inflight entertainment was circa 1980 however the flight was so short it did not really matter. If there was a disappointment it was the seats. No sooner had we taken off and the person in from reclined their seat and I was flashed back to economy. The seat hit my legs and that was a real disappointment. Look at doing something about that and nobody will have anything to complain about.
,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew Deluxe economy Gatwick - Saigon then internally to Danang - Siem Reap - Hanoi and back to Gatwick. Pleasantly surprised having read the reviews as very content with the service glass of bubbly then good wines with ok meals. The entertainment is about the same standard as the older BA planes but best bring a tablet with you if you want more choices. Internal flights are on new A321 airbus plenty of legroom (food not great). Overall for the price and convenience of flying direct to Vietnam would use again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,,4,yes,10,June 2013 SGN - HAN: Vietnam Airlines saved us from a near disaster. My wife left her Kindle in the seat back pocket only to discover she'd done so in the taxi after leaving the airport. We were to fly to the U.S. two days later. A couple of strategic phone calls by our travel agent friend later we returned to the airport not hopeful at all. Despite 30 minutes to clean the aircraft for its return flight to SGN the ground staff had found the reader and delivered it to lost and found. Nicely done!
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew internal flights in Vietnam: HCM - DaNang. Then DaNang - Hanoi and finally Hanoi - HCM. We paid for the empty seats and upgrade policies through Optiontown - best bargain ever! All flights on time sensible check-in times at airports not the hours waiting about you get in Europe. Cannot recommend highly enough especially for the prices paid.
,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,I have used them 3 times for the London-Ho Chi Minh City route in the past 6 months in addition to a return flight Ho Chi Minh City-Hong Kong in March 2014 and Ho Chi Minh City-Da Nang in July 2013. Each time the flights were on time the planes of acceptable standard with most in-flight functions working (except one return flight to Gatwick in January 2014 when the in-flight program was not functioning). In my experience the flight staff were courteous and attentive. The food is of equal standard to most other International airlines (slightly disappointing as Vietnamese Cuisine is probably the best in the World). My wife did however experience a problem when she flew from Gatwick to Ho Chi Minh via Frankfurt (technical problem and delays). I have travelled extensively for the past 25 years across the Middle-East and USA and suggest that Vietnam Air are a good option for my requirements. Their luggage allowance is generous and they offer the benefit of a direct service from UK (however check scheduled stop-overs in Germany which appear to be seasonal).
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,yes,6,SYD-HCM-Hanoi on 22 Feb Hanoi-HCM-SYD on 26 Feb. Not the best certainly not the worst. Value for money fare. Inflight entertainment probably the worst point except HCM-SYD on return on a new/refurb A330 which was a bit more like it. Service absolutely fine food more than palatable bit stingy on the drinks but always available when asked for extra water. Transfers at HCM a bit frantic but bearable.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,How pleasantly surprised I was flew London to Ho Chi Minh Ho Chi Minh to Da Nang Da Nang to Siem Reap Siem Reap to Hanoi and Hanoi to London. All excellent on time excellent service comfort and value. The prop plane used to fly to Siem Reap was a delight. Would not hesitate to use again easily comparable to its competitors.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,I had never flown with Vietnam Airlines however after my recent trip from Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur my opinion has changed. It was a comfortable flight with very nice staff and good quality food seats were comfortable.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,SIN-SGN in Business on A321. Excellent 2 hour flight on time departure and early arrival. New airbus 321 with comfortable and spacious business class seats in a 2x2 configuration. The whole trip was vastly superior to European carriers on short haul flights with a generous and tasty choice of hot meal welcome drink and hot towels. An extra bus to the terminal (apron parking) for business class passengers upon arrival. Speedy and easy immigration in Ho Chi Minh and the luggage on the belt before we got there.
,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew Gatwick to Hanoi outwards and Saigon to Gatwick inwards. We were pleasantly surprised having read a number of adverse reviews. Outward flight was slightly delayed for 1 hour on the outward flight due to congestion we were kept informed. We travelled premier economy and this proved very good value for money. Inflight staff were friendly helpful and competent. Some were not English speakers but they understood the principle of customer car. In flight special meals were provided and in flight food was excellent. I'd be happy to recommend Vietnam airlines for flying direct to and from Gatwick to Vietnam. Internal flights with this airline in Vietnam were also good and punctual.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,1,no,,I missed a connecting flight en route MEL-SYD to HCM. Qantas domestic flight was over an hour late departing Melb so missed VN air flight to HCM from Sydney. Qantas/Vietnam Airlines offered to fly me back to MEL and start journey again tomorrow or to fly on elsewhere. I chose to fly to Singapore where they put me up and next day flew on to HCM with Jetstar. My only extra cost was for meals and arriving a day late. On return flight HCM-MEL you fly overnight and they crank the heat way up on plane. It's like an 8 hour sauna. Even my wife (Vietnamese) was burning up it was so hot last time. I asked 5 times to lower the heat. They lowered it to 25 degrees (still too hot) and after that ignored me and never responded to calls.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,3,yes,5,LGW-HAN-SGN REP-LGW. It did not start well as our flight from Gatwick left 2 hours late with us sat on the plane for all of that time. The flight itself was fine the food was good and plentiful and despite previous reviews all the IFE screens seemed to be working the entertainment choice was however poor there were no service issues as flight attendants were never far away the plane is however quite old. The flight from Hanoi to HCM at the point of wheels up the right hand engine hit a bird. This resulted in another 2 hrs sat on the plane awaiting confirmation no damage had been done. This plane was ancient and you could feel springs in the seat. The next flight from REP to SGN was great. Flight left 10 mins early took only 42 mins instead of an hour on what looked like a brand new plane. We then were to connect with a flight back to London and had the pleasant surprise of being given complimentary lounge passes and free food. The flight back left bang on time but this plane was older then the one going out with the same entertainment choice and the food was poor. I would fly again but only when they get some new planes.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,1,Ho Chi Minh - Da Nang - Hanoi - Phu Quoc - Ho Chi Minh. The first flight to Da Nang was re-scheduled by 3 hours on the day and then delayed a further 45 minutes - no explanation or apology was given. Ground staff seemed to be immune to complaints from passengers. Food was advertised online but only mineral water was given out. No promised food was given out on the flight to Hanoi either and it was delayed. The flight to Phu Quoc offered terrible food and was delayed. The flight back to Ho Chi Minh City did leave almost on time. Staff on all the flights couldn't care less all aircraft were showing their age and flights seem to leave only when Vietnam Airlines decide they want them to. It is frightening when initially you don't see your flight on the departure board at the scheduled time only to find it further down the board at a newly-decided time. I would try one of the competing domestic carriers next time. If this is the quality of SkyTeam then I will personally avoid the whole alliance.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,"Luang Prabang to Hanoi Hué to HCMC both A321. New aircraft. Flights on time friendly crew clean aircraft and good info from the cockpit. Attention to safety procedures. No IFE but magazines surprisingly good. I lost my credit card on the flight and the friendly ground staff went the extra mile to retrieve it for me in good humour. The Luang Prabang flight had a snack listed but it was just a non-alcoholic drink. Only water on the short Hué flight but it cost so little that anything else would have been worth 10% of the flight price. VN definitely belong to the family of ""good"" Asian airlines."
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,MEL-SGN-TPE-SGN-MEL with breaks in between various legs for business meetings. I can only say excellent all round. Vietnam Airlines offer close to 5-Star Service in Business Class if my own previous experiences with other airlines are any guide. I found check-in on Vietnam Airlines can occasionally be rather chaotic mainly because so many apparent first time and naive flyers seem to crowd into the business class check-in or boarding areas with their relatives seeing them off and with no idea of accepted boarding processes. Nevertheless on-board food and wine first rate with an amazing 4-choice main menu on some flights which were all on-time unless airport control dictated otherwise. Superb service from extremely well groomed flight attendants. I would prefer more in-flight comment from the flight crew especially as the flight map on some flights was not working. The Business Lounge in Saigon is quite good and adequate with good views of the tarmac and shared lounges (VN Airlines use the Qantas lounge in Melbourne and China Airlines in Taipei) - quite good. My only gripe was that management of in-flight turbulence and warning seemed poor as was the management of some passengers who completely ignored safety instructions (the guy next to me on one sector put his seat into the fully flat bed position during taxiing for take off which would have meant I would not have been able to quickly leave the aircraft in an emergency). However to be fair to the cabin crew they could do little to solve this problem as they were required to be strapped into their crew seats at the same time of take-off anyway. Very good inflight reading on Vietnam Airlines.
,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew London to Hanoi Hanoi to Siem Reap Siem Reap to Ho Chi Min City internal flight in Vietnam then Hanoi to London. The flight service etc was great. Comparable with BA flights. Great value for money.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew LGW-SGN on 21st December. Having read a lot of reviews I was expecting to have some type of trouble with our booking. To be fair I could not fault VN one bit! Business class was not outrageously expensive and well worth the money. Yes the plane/cabin is a bit older and a touch dated but everything worked and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The food was plentiful and the drink continued to flow throughout the flight. For those that care the plane departed and arrived on time. All in all a great start to our Christmas getaway.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,We flew business class LGW-HAN-SGN-MEL-SGN-LGW. The seats on the Boeings on the London legs are not as nice as on the Airbus on Australia routes neither are fully flat beds. Food was better on the flights to Vietnam than on flights from Vietnam - this may be due it being classed as Lunch on inbound and Supper on outbound flights. IFE kept breaking up on SGN-LGW leg so I gave up.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew from CDG Paris to Hanoi. The flight boarded on time and the staff were very good. The seats were as normal for economy class. The seat back TV was good not a great choice of films but it was fine. The service was excellent very attentive. The food served was good and the selection was good.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,,4,yes,10,HKG-HAN and SGN-HKG both flights with A321 both flights excellent on time with friendly staff. Food was delicious 2 options of meat (Western / Asian) and 2 options of fish. 2 servings of wine plus coffee or tea. What else do you want in a 2 hour of flight?
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,MEL-SGN-MEL on A330 in Economy. Undoubtedly two of the worst flights I can remember in recent memory. First time on VN and will be the last time. Can't think of anything particularly positive to say other than one of the two flights was on time. Other than that it was an awful experience. The A330 equipment is dated and falling apart. Masking tape used in several places to hold together broken parts. Problems with IFE on both flights which required resetting the screen - unsuccessful on all occasions - so no video either way. Food was unfit for human consumption. But even worse was a compete lack of warmth or professionalism by the cabin crew or ground personnel. Very few smiles cabin crew disappears for long periods at a time is gruff when approached with a small request. Having flown several of the carriers throughout Asia most of which are models of efficiency and great service VN sits rock bottom in my opinion. This is an airline from the dark ages. And to make the experience even worse we did a 'go around' before landing at MEL on a beautiful calm clear morning which didn't inspire much confidence from a safety perspective. Would avoid at any and all costs.
,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,FRA-SGN on 21/12 in Deluxe Economy on B777. Flight was fully booked despite this the crew were always very friendly and helpful - even in the middle of the night and came very quickly after calling them. IFE does not have such a big choice compared to other airlines but it was ok. Most movies were available in different languages (e.g. English French German). Quality of food (dinner and breakfast) was good and the quantity was more than enough. Menu cards were given soon after departure and for both meals there was a choice between Asian and western food. Amenity kit was a small plastic bag with toothbrush sleeping mask ear plugs and socks.
,,,Premium Economy,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,I was very disappointed in the standard and grubbiness of the aircraft for a long haul flight thank goodness we booked economy delux because had we just booked economy it would have been even worse. The plane was so old only one toilet worked in our part of the aircraft and the inflight entertainment was non existent. The controls on the side of the seats were so worn we were unable to determine which was which. The staff seemed to be relaxed on the level of service that was provided. We were lucky to have a bottle of water half way through the 13 hour flight. I will never fly with this company again. Compared to the quality of Aircraft and Service using internal flights Vietnam Airlines need to get their act together and take some lessons from other carriers in the area.
,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,10,SGN-FRA on 31/12 in Deluxe Economy on B777. Like on the flight from FRA to SGN the crew were very friendly and helpful - even in the middle of the night. They came very quickly after calling them via the call button. In Deluxe Economy there was only 9 pax for 2 flight attendants so the service was very personal. Menu cards were given soon after departure and for both meals there was a choice between Asian and Western food. The crew take the meal order personally and some minutes later the menu was brought directly from the galley to the seat (no trolley service). Quality of food (dinner and breakfast) was very good and the quantity was more than enough. Amenity kit was a small plastic bag with toothbrush sleeping mask ear plugs and socks. IFE has not such a big choice than other airlines but it was ok. Most movies were available in different languages (e.g. English French German).
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,,3,yes,6,ICN-HAN-KUL on 12/25 and SIN-SGN-ICN on 1/2. Both flights departed and arrived on time. Two hour layovers in each airport. I booked a SkyMiles award for these flights one month out at 45000 miles and $55 taxes. My friends paid for their tickets which were around 300 USD less than non-stop on Korean Air. HAN airport is extremely basic - lots of tired-looking souvenir stalls a random local restaurant that no one eats at and a Burger King. The terminal felt very empty at 2 PM in the afternoon. SGN airport is much newer but spotty wi-fi and the same assortment of random tourist junk and a few restaurants. Keep your layovers there as short as possible. The planes to/from ICN were very old. Think pink walls drop down TVs and a seat back TV smaller than most new cell phones. The movie selection was that you watched what they played no choices. They offered a meal but they all tasted the same. They also served supper after take off on the red eye to ICN which is frustrating because you only get around 3.5 hours of sleep by the time they turn off the lights. The narrow body jets to KUL/from SIN were much nicer and newer. People say Korean Air has a warm cabin but they haven't flown VN. Stiflingly hot the entire time. The cabin staff was kind to me during service but I didn't need them for anything else. Overall their service is a conundrum. They offer champagne and menus for economy meal service but their planes are dated. We arrived safely and everyone was polite. I would definitely continue to travel Korean Air first but the price is very nice if you're on a budget just don't expect a lot.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,yes,4,Domestic travels SGN-HUI-SGN-BMV-SGN-HUI-SGN. The airline is falling behind and no innovations for ages. A good amount of FA's have absolutely nothing to do apart from dishing out a bottle of water. Check-in from provinces only possible at the earliest 2 hours before travel (at times very limiting of flexibility). Transfers not possible with onward connections: one is dropped out to collect luggage queue up for check in and security for ages (in Saigon 1-2 hours typically). What an unnecessary hassle and waste of time instead of allowing domestic transits. Tickets purchased in airports are not properly invoiced just typewritten” and very basic. No entertainment of FA interaction on board but only a roaring silence during flights. Other airlines now take advantage of this ailing boring conservative airline (Jetstar Vietjetair Mekong etc.) and have a fresh appeal. On the positive site: Delays are relatively rare. Luggage allowance are de facto generous. They have plenty town offices which provide direct services.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,4,yes,9,A321 from CGK-SGN. Poor transit airport. Flew A330-200 SGN-HAN. Quite nice facilities but need improvements. B777-200ER HAN-SGN then SGN-CGK with A321 - quite a comfortable A321.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,3,no,4,First travelled with VN when they first started flying to Australia. In those days the Cabin Crew gave the Business Class passengers gifts on leaving the flight. So much has changed but as a previous reviewer said you get what you paid for. Flew from Sydney to HCMC and returned from Paris to HCMC and next day flew to Sydney. The flight was uneventful food good audio lousy and the beds dreadful. Once we arrived in HCMC we were off loaded onto the Tarmac without any warning. We only ever have carry on and to stagger down the stairs to a waiting bus was the last thing I needed on arrival. Staff pleasant and service good but other airlines have moved on but VN still lagging behind in comfort. Cheap and not nice!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,,,3,no,6,Return flight from SIN-SGN-ICN. Meal service was great! However flight from SIN-SGN the cabin crew had no smiles and due to the a small A321 the space was limited and they kept banging into me without any apologies. Service from SGN-ICN was good. However the return from ICN-SGN was disappointing. The check-in had more than 12 check in counters however they opened 6 for group check in and only 5 for normal economy check in and that morning they had 4 flights to Vietnam - I waited for more than an hour just to get my check in done.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,4,"Jakarta to Saigon November 25 2013 on Airbus 321. The plane departed a little bit late Jakarta airport is chaos I flew for a round trip between SGN and HAN. The staff at SGN was nice though I had no idea why he was so slow in re-checking for my information as I had checked-in online previously. By the way they dedicated a counter for check-in online passengers but it was unhelpful. And worse the staffs at HAN check-in counters were rude like I was begging them something. VN used A330 and B777 for my flights which were good a bit comfortable. The stewardess' English was terrible though. Food was so disappointed to me with a cold thick sandwich. One of the worst in-flight meals I'd ever tasted. Two-hours flights were without any entertainment so boring! Flying domestically VN may be the best but for travelling overseas I would say ""No!"" with VN."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,2,no,3,"Jakarta to Saigon November 25 2013 on Airbus 321. The plane departed a little bit late Jakarta airport is chaos and nearly all flights have delays in departing or arriving. What surprised me was that the plane was pushed back while some passengers were still loading their cabin luggage into overhead lockers. Cabin crews seemed to be ignorant as they were busy organizing meal trolleys. Crews hardly smiled and when you asked something they were very slow and sometimes just said ""later"" without being helpful. On the way back November 29 2013 the crews looked fresher but some were indeed not friendly. I will try to avoid using this airline in the future. Not mentioning long haul short haul flight experience was not pleasant at all."
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Melbourne - Hanoi via Ho Chi Minh. Flight left on Time from Melbourne upgraded to business class using optiontown. Good comfortable seats great food excellent service and adequate inflight entertainment. Super service from flight crew. Day time flight so arrives into Ho Chi Minh at just after 4pm local time and departs from domestic to Hanoi at 1830. Just enough time to complete immigration and customs. Unfortunately due to some serious issues with the baggage handling at Melbourne Airport our bags missed the connection and had to follow us the next day. I don't blame Vietnam Airlines for the issue as issue was Melbourne airports and can only praise the way they handled the situation on arrival in Hanoi. Bags arrived 2 days later to our hotel in Hanoi.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Ho Chi Minh to Sydney. Flight left on Time from Ho Chi Minh upgraded to business class using optiontown. Good comfortable seats great food excellent service and adequate inflight entertainment. Super service from flight crew. Night flight and 2 meal service which is a bit unnecessary as only 4-5 hours apart but cannot complain about to much being offered can you.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,To be fair you get what you pay for in regards to quality and service the flights were on time and the food was good. The biggest issue we had was the plane from Frankfurt to Saigon had a technical problem with one of the emergency exits and they had to ask for 27 volunteers who would receive 600 euros per passenger to take another flight trying to get this paid is like trying to extract a tooth from a lion total wall of silence.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,Flew from Melbourne to Siem Reap via Ho Chi Minh. The plane was modern and clean and the service in business class was excellent. The flight was on time. The flight from Ho Chi Minh to Siem Reap was operated by Cambodia Air and this plane was very old but was fine for a 45 minute flight. Both of my return flights were operated by Vietnam Airlines and the service was excellent. Only issue I had was that I was given an economy seat for the Siem Reap to Ho Chi Minh flight when I had a ticket for business class. After querying this I was given the correct seat. The food and service was excellent and I would happily fly with this airline again. Please take care to check if you need a visa for Vietnam. I was in transit however some people have noted that their ticket fails to mention an internal flight from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi (and then say to Paris). This happened to a friend of mine and resulted in her return visa being cancelled and she had to promptly organise a visa for her flight from Ho Chi Min to Hanoi. Best to check with the airline as some passengers have been caught out by this.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,,5,yes,9,KUL-SGN-KUL on A321 economy class. First time on Vietnam Airlines and had a pleasant surprise. What I thought suppose to be decent 90 minutes flight turned out to be an eye opener. The service was outstanding and the food was good compared to other 5-star airlines that ply the same routes. The seat pitch is quite comfortable and the configuration of 160+ people made the cabin look spacious and un-crowded.
,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,We flew LDN to Hanoi HCM to LDN. Upgraded using option town to Deluxe economy - definitely worth it - more leg room. Food was really good option of western or Vietnamese. Plane was Boeing 777- very safe aircraft if not the most modern. Service was great by the staff welcome towels drinks brought round. If you wanted more food during the flight all you needed to do was go to the galley and get sandwiches drinks etc. If you are used to flying Qatar Airlines then maybe its not the same service as you get there but for the price and the fact you fly direct in a safe plane then I would definitely recommend Vietnam Airlines. Was on time both ways.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,VN54 from Gatwick to Hanoi on 12/11/2013. The service was good the staff helpful drinks were brought round frequently during the night and the food was no worse than any other economy airline. The aircraft seemed quite old and the seats were not overly comfortable. Our travelling companions' entertainment screens did not work which was disappointing on a long flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,4,yes,9,SGN-BKK with A321. On time great food nice staff clean plane. Definitely a 4 star flight. Only minus that we were not given immigration form for Thailand on the plane.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,2,no,3,We had 2 long haul flights from Gatwick to Hanoi and a return journey 16 days later 13 Oct and 29th. On both journeys we found the staff more interested in holding conversations among themselves ignoring passengers and even shouting to each other. On both flights the toilets were dirty no soap in the dispensers and filthy floors on long flights. Passengers should expect regular opportunities to have drinks water or juice in particular on each flight we had to go to the galley to get drinks. The leg room was very small we had more room on most of the internal flights we took in Vietnam and Cambodia. We have travelled to a lot of countries and this is one of worst airlines we have used.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,,,5,yes,8,HKG-SGN-HKG Business - good flights excellent food and service and a certain charm not normally experienced on many airlines. I enjoy the VN Airlines Lounge at Saigon but not the shared lounge at Hong Kong which reminded of a seedy bar. However I do not wish to detract from the very pleasant on-time and professional experience I had on Vietnam Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,In March this year we booked a flight from Melbourne to Ho Chi Min City then on to Danang. We were not due to travel until October. My husband and I have traveled extensively on various airlines. Our flight from Melbourne to Ho Chi Min City was not delayed significantly the inflight entertainment worked perfectly the food was very nice the plane was in good condition (no broken seats or arm rests) and staff were exceptional. You were not bothered every five minutes by them but if you wanted or needed something they were there in an instant and always with a smile. It was one of the best international flights I have ever been on. My only small criticism is that the seats are a little on the hard side and after a 9 hour flight my bottom was a bit sore. We had a connecting flight from Ho Chi Min City to Danang which was cancelled. The staff managed to get us on a flight that actually left fifty minutes earlier than the one we were supposed to be on. The airline representative went to huge lengths to make sure our bags went on the correct flight. When we arrived in Danang our luggage was there and so was our transfer. In total we had four flights with Vietnam Airlines and every one of them was excellent.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,,,4,yes,7,"Flew Singapore-Ho Chi Minh City-Danang and Hanoi-Singapore. On checking in at Singapore I was expecting my baggage to be checked in all the way to Danang with a 2-hour transit in Ho Chi Minh City. The check-in agent at Changi informed me that this cannot be done as ""there is no longer any immigration at Danang"". No immigration at Danang? Silkair flies direct from Singapore to Danang! How do they clear international passengers there then? Perhaps it is the way the Ho Chi Minh airport is designed that does not allow international passengers to transit smoothly from the international terminal to the domestic terminal? Even if we have to go through immigration at Ho Chi Minh City why can't the baggage be checked in all the way? The result? I had to go through immigration at Ho Chi Minh City collect the luggage myself walk to the domestic terminal with my luggage and check-in again for my flight to Danang. This is not a transit it's a transfer and it's with the same airline! Return from Hanoi to Singapore was less eventful. Used Optiontown for an upgrade to Business Class. Well worth the money if only to avoid the very long queues at economy check-in with their big tour groups. Food and service in Business Class was also very good."
,,,Premium Economy,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,no,1,Flew from London to HCM Deluxe Economy. The flight was a nightmare and not what I expected. The deluxe economy was absolutely not worth the difference. Cramped and the cabin temperature was so hot it was hard to breath. We did not receive a flight pack and there were two toothbrushes in the toilets. I asked for an eye mask and after a lot of fuss one was found but not in a hygienic bag. Cutlery for breakfast was plastic. The inflight entertainment was faulty. The flight stopped in Frankfurt and we were left without any information for two hours. I will not be flying with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,no,,The most chaotic check-in I have had the misfortune to experience was at Hanoi Airport this morning trying to check in for the VN Singapore flight. Unclear queues people pushing in slow check-in and unhelpful unsmiling staff when passengers were getting concerned about being able to check in on time despite being at the airport in good time. Naturally the flight was late leaving and also late arriving at Singapore without a word of apology by anyone. Whilst the flight was otherwise uneventful the whole experience was horrible and it was good to be back at Changi.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,1,"Myself and my wife have travelled extensively throughout Asia and Europe. We are halfway through a 2 week Business class trip to numerous destinations in Vietnam. We were booked to travel to Danang from Hanoi yesterday. Due to a typhoon flights were delayed. NO-one at Vietnam airlines would advise us if they would be rescheduling flights. No communication to passengers no notices. Nothing to let us know what was happening. We waited for 6 hours at the airport. We after repeated requests were rescheduled to first available flight the next day 30 hours after our flight was postponed. We left the airport to get a hotel room for the night at 8.40pm. Friends of ours who could not afford to stay in a hotel decided to stay at the airport. They were put on an ""unscheduled flight"" 20 mins after we left the airport. We are extremely upset with Vietnam Airlines They told us that no flights would be leaving until after 2am and that we had to rebook with first available seats (business or coach) which were 9pm the following night. How can it be that we are told there is no seats and no flights yet our friends (coach travellers) are at the destination and we are still sitting here waiting for ""the only flight available""? Vietnam airlines seriously lack communication skills integrity and respect to the passengers. I would advise anyone wishing to travel with Vietnam Airlines to seriously think about another airline. The most disappointing experience we have had with any airline."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,,"Customer service is not in this airlines vocabulary. Planes are old and tired and the ones we flew on the video screens did not work. Flew from Hanoi to Gatwick via Frankfurt on 20th September 2013. Plane was due to depart Frankfurt at 07-15 on 21st but it went ""tec"" and after a couple of hours flight was cancelled. We were eventually re-booked on to the 16-15 Lufthansa flight to Heathrow. Vietnam Airlines had no representative at Frankfurt and made no effort to transport us from Heathrow to Gatwick where we had parked our car. We thus had to arrange our own transfer. During the 9 hour delay we endured all we received in terms of refreshment was a small cheese roll and a can of Fanta orange. We would certainly not recommend this airline and would advise that if we travel to Vietnam again it would be with a more reputable airline."
,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,Due to fly to Hanoi via Frankfurt on 20th Sep 13 at 1010hrs. Flight cancelled until 21 Sep 13. Reason given was aircraft U/S in Germany awaiting spare part. Put up in Hilton Hotel. Note pushed under our door at 2200hrs saying Flight was now 0640hrs on 21 Sep with check-in at 0500hrs! On arrival at check-in at 0500hrs no one there! Eventually turned up at 0520hrs. Flight delayed boarded at 0700 but didn't take-off until 0835hrs. Landed in Frankfurt to be told we could not leave the aircraft. The crew left the aircraft and the cleaning staff came on board to clean the aircraft. Spent nearly 3 hours on the plane no refreshments offered we had to ask for a drink. Some people helping themselves as nobody on board. Eventually the new crew came on board followed by the German passengers who found that the seats had been double booked! Told to sit wherever they could. Took-off at about 1320hrs. I suspect 2 half full flights had been turned into 1 full one! No inflight entertainment either going to Hanoi or coming back. Food and service poor. Never travel with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,no,,Bought Vietnam airlines flight as it was the fastest to Hanoi. Travelled on VN0144 from LGW to Hanoi. First the plane said it was delayed until 12.30 and there was nobody to be found in the Vietnam Airlines help desk until around 1. They said that the plane had been delayed until tomorrow giving us a £5 meal voucher for a decent meal in Gatwick £5 does not go far. We got put up in the Gatwick Hilton and fed which was good but what was bad is that they gave us no information until around 10 at night by a note under the door. Vietnam Airlines had no customer service rep sent to the hotel. We finally got on the flight the next morning at around 10.00 (24hrs later). The first leg was to Frankfurt which on arrival we found out that the seats had been double booked. Also we were not allowed to get off which was annoying as I wanted to get some liquid duty free items as we were told that we were not allowed to take them to Frankfurt. The long haul stretch was uncomfortable for me as there was very limited leg space and the in flight entertainment was broken. Also the air crew let the passengers run riot over the drinks. This meant that people on board got rowdy and Vietnam airlines crew just sat at the back of the plane doing nothing. Plane safety - I didn't feel safe on-board because of the amount of disorganization and chaos from the airline. They also had no emphasis on safety and didn't show the safety videos on it's hurried take off from Frankfurt.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5,yes,7,Flew Ho Chi Minh to Frankfurt 4 Oct on Boeing 777 200 series in business class. Although seats are a little on the old side the were reasonably comfortable. The inflight entertainment system did not work and only one film offered on the main screen which is not acceptable in business class! Otherwise food and was excellent. Again no showers at Ho Chi Minh airport business class lounge.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,The pros: plane took off and landed safely seats were relatively spacious. My boyfriend and I traveled from Ho Chi Minh City to Phu Quoc and back in the last week. You'd think there'd be minimum hassle on a 50 minute flight. Outbound our flight attendants completely ignored a phone that was ringing and people snapping pictures and listening to iPods during take off and landing. The flight back from Phu Quoc was even worse. One of the main points of interest is fish sauce made on the island. We bought two small bottles hoping to send it in our luggage and were told that was not possible. It's a Vietnam Airlines-specific regulation. A group of passengers were sitting stewing because they were also not informed they could not transport fish sauce. Our flight was delayed and an announcement repeatedly said to contact a representative with questions but to do so I had to walk out of the gate and check back in again. Luckily it was a small airport and was not too busy. Still I will never fly Vietnam Airlines again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,no,,Just arrived home from my trip and am appalled at the lack of service I received after our flight from Gatwick to Hanoi was delayed over 24 hours on 21st Aug! Left in the Airport from 1.30pm until 10pm not knowing what was happening and only updated every 2 hours. At 10.30 told that we were going to the Sofitel for the night and we should fly out at 11am the next day. Upon arriving the next morning we were told that the flight was delayed again and should leave at 1.30pm. During this whole ordeal we were only given two $7 meal vouchers! Once we boarded we were given a letter to explain the delay to our insurance companies but this letter only stated that we were delayed 23 hours! I finally got the chance to try and get some information when I was flying out of Hanoi to Melbourne and to see if I could get the time on my letter changed. I was waiting for over an hour at the help desk while they tried to find out what time we left as the records showed we left at 9am! Told there was nothing they could do. I can't complain about the price of the flights and the in flight meals. If you don't mind delays and are on a budget - go with Vietnam Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,yes,5,I have just returned from a trip to London from Melbourne via Hanoi. Vietnam Airlines provided the cheapest flight on this route. I understood that when booking a cheap flight that I would get what I paid for. Better than I thought there were personal screens with a choice of about 2 dozen movies and the food ranged from very good to ok (depending on leg). It was the little things which let it down Hanoi-London my screen did not work London- Hanoi my seat did not recline Hanoi-Ho Chi Minh they had double booked my seat so I was moved to another seat. Was I unlucky? - maybe. The biggest issue however was the Vietnam Visa issue. My travel agent (and I) had not arranged a Vietnam Visa (as the Hanoi-HCM flight is a domestic flight and requires transfer to domestic terminal) so when I arrived at Tullamarine for the first leg of my flight I was asked to step to the side and made hurried and stressful arrangements for a last minute Visa pre-approval letter. The Vietnam Airlines customer service officer on hand was very helpful but it would have been better if (i) the need for a Visa had been clearer at time of booking or (ii) there could be some arrangement meaning that Visa is not required for transit.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,4,yes,9,TPE-SGN (Ho Chi Minh City). Economy class. Great experience. Friendly flight staff dressed smartly dressed in uniforms. Pleasant lunch and they offered me an extra (free) beer. In flight entertainment isn't much but who needs that when you have a good book or a tablet.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,5,yes,7,Just back from the UK flew Sydney - Ho Chi Minh City - London and back the same way. SYD-HCMC flight was better than HCMC-LHR plane was newer and more comfortable and in-flight entertainment was better. HCMC-LHR plane was older and due a refit/upgrade as in-flight entertainment was very limited for a 13 hour flight. Food was better than we imagined offering a choice of western or Asian style and staff were very attentive and pleasant serving drinks frequently. Only thing that got our goat was the 8 hour layover on the way out and the 13 hour layover on the way back although VA provided meal vouchers for the wait in the airport we felt somehow spoiled by Emirates who provided a hotel room in the same circumstance. You can leave the airport provided you get a letter from the Vietnamese consulate prior to arriving in the country we were not aware of this. All in all for the price we paid ($1500) each Sydney-London return it was value for money and would use Vietnam Airlines again but would sort out a visa first. Give them a go if your on a budget or pay double and fly a brand airline the choice is yours I have been as honest as I can as I myself read these forums before travelling and was pleasantly surprised.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,,3,no,2,Just flew Hanoi - HCM - Sydney. Flight delayed out of Hanoi. Also delayed 40 mins or so coming out of HCM (for some reason that we were not told) - we sat on the tarmac getting hotter and hotter as the aircon wasn't working well. Very limited choice of inflight movies. I could not watch any because the sound wasn't working on my system and staff said there was nothing they could do. Plane was old and seats very close together and hard. Woman next to me was texting after takeoff and staff said nothing. Staff were pleasant and tried hard but couldn't really compensate for overall poor customer experience. Would suggest avoid this airline if you possibly can.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,no,,"Flying SGN-KUL on 18 August with old parents. Manage to upgrade the business class via option town. Special meal requested during the booking and special meal was confirmed. I took my own initiative to double confirmed on the special meal. It printed clearly on the boarding pass. No special meal is served. The reason given from the Leading Steward ""We do not received any information regarding your request""."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,6,Flew from Melbourne - Ho Chi Minh - Paris. Great flight for the price food was good service was fine staff don't smile much but overall we enjoyed our flight to Paris. Home from London flying Vietnam Airlines stop over in Hanoi made it a long flight having to catch an internal flight to Ho Chi Minh then onto Melbourne but the prices were excellent. Saved around $4000 by flying with them.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,5,yes,8,Recently used VN for our domestic flights in Vietnam during our recent trip. Both flights departed and landed on time. Paid the extra for business for the extra luggage allowance you get. Seats were spacious and comfortable and a drink and snack was provided even though very short flights. Crew smiling and pleasant. Would highly recommend for domestic flights around Vietnam.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,2,no,3,Flown two long haul flights (Gatwick-HCMC-Gatwick) further three internal flights with them. Whereas the internal flights were fine (comfortable seats ok food quick check in etc.) the long haul flights are another beast. The seats are hard the armrests would not fold up the leg rests dig into your legs when folded up particularly the aisle seats have a metal box underneath them which further limits the leg space. The inflight entertainment either does not work or is very limited. The food is very bad. Online booking of seats is not possible turning up 4 hours before departure is still not good enough to secure an emergency exit seat or similar. Would not recommend this airline for long haul flights.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Just had 4 four flights with Vietnam Airlines (July 2013) 2 long haul Gatwick to HCM and Hanoi to Gatwick and 2 internal. We managed to secure upgrades to Business Class (relatively easy and inexpensive) for the long haul flights. No complaints whatsoever cabin was good service was exceptional. food was great. When the flight crew were not in the cabin and I wanted something I just went and asked as on most long haul flights irrelevant of cabin class the crew are in the cabin for only a short time. The internal flights (not business class) once again were very good staff pleasant and so on. I obviously have not experienced the basic long haul flight cabins and service but for what we had and the little amount we paid for the 15000 miles I traveled with them I am very pleased.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,Flew to Paris. 2 days before the flight discovered we needed to purchase a landing VISA to transit through the country. When we checked in we were only given boarding passes for the first leg of the trip and told we would have to collect our bags once we had purchased our VISAs. First flight from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh City our head sets didn't work and flight attendants unhelpful. Request for vegetarian meals was not granted. Upon landing in Ho Chi Minh City we raced to the VISA counter. Once we got them we collected our bags and were given boarding passes for a domestic flight to Hanoi. Boarded only to disembark due to a 'technical difficulty'. 20 mins later given new boarding passes and allowed to board the same aircraft. In Hanoi we made our flight to Paris with 15 mins to spare. Unfortunately the process had to be repeated coming home with additional cost for the paperwork needed for the VISA. After a 13 hour flight from Paris we had to collect our bags clear customs and recheck in. Followed by an 8 hour wait in Hanoi's Domestic Terminal which is very small and lacking in facilities followed by another 2 hour flight to Ho Chi Minh and a further 3 hour wait before we boarded our plane to Melbourne. We would not recommend flying with this carrier. They weren't reliable friendly or cost effective in any way.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,7th July on VN144 returned on 23rd on VN942. I was very nervous to fly VA long haul after reading all the reviews online therefore I was very pleasantly surprised on my outbound journey! Plane was clean the stewardesses were friendly and polite the food was amazing and the in flight entertainment worked! And to top it off we got free meal coupons (breakfast and lunch) at the airport restaurant because we had a long wait. However the return flight wasn't as pleasant as the plane seemed slightly smaller and the leg room was terrible. Still considering I half of what I normally would I couldn't complain. All in all a good airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,3,Sydney - Ho Chi Minh - Frankfurt return. On the first flight from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh the flight attendants huddled in the back while they sat and talked. I had a 7 hour layover on the way to Europe. On all flights there were some good some bad flight attendants. Also on all flights the food was just ok. A Vietnamese friend of mine said I should bring some extra food of my own for this same reason. Check-in was a nightmare due to inability of people to queue up as well. The inflight entertainment didn't work on the first 12 hour flight back and it kept restarting on the second 10 hour flight. I had a 12 hour layover coming back which is beyond acceptable. I would never fly with Vietnam Airlines again.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,,Don't fly Vietnam Airlines if you are anywhere near 6 ft tall. Our flight was called 20 minutes before due flight time 75 minutes later no one had boarded no announcements to explain those keen to get on early were still in the queue. Flight was nearly full but back row was free I asked if I could take a seat was told to get back to my seat. Staff treated passengers with barely disguised contempt. They offered chicken or beef options for the main course and we were one of the first served. My wife and I asked for the beef and were told there was only 1 left! Breakfast was completely inedible I looked around the cabin the food was virtually untouched. Overall one of the worst flights in over 30 years of flying.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,SGN - SIN and return. Flight attendants friendly. Felt relaxed and comfortable. Clean cabin and clean toilet.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,My holiday was to start in June 2013 so I booked in Feb 2013. Advised that flight no. 1314 from Saigon to Da Nang. One month before my holiday the flight was cancelled and the times changed - flight no. 1316. Then on arrival in Vietnam advised again that the flight was cancelled and changed to flight no. 1318. On arrival to Saigon airport advised that the flight no. 1318 was delayed for a total of 6 hours for a 1 hour flight. All I can say is that this is very poor service from an airline that has a monopoly position in the local market. They need some serious competition to sharpen up their service standards.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,3,no,5,Siem Reap - Luang Prabang April 30th. Plane looks new but the cabin was not very well maintained with dirty windows loose tables and my backrest would not stay upright. Disappointing service for the relatively high prices with just a rather disgusting sandwich an apple and soft drinks offered. No tea or coffee or beer. Flight attendants are courteous but do not smile or interact with passengers and that despite the flight being almost empty. However they got us there safely and on time.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1,no,2,Flight VN931 on 24 May 2013 from Luang Prabang (Laos) to Siem Reap (Cambodia) an ATR72 aircraft only 7 passengers on board a cabin crew of 3 flight attendants (all men). After takeoff a small meal box with a cake and a desert was given to each passenger no drinks not even water for a 1hr 45mins flight and it was not a cheap flight! A big surprise to see all flights attendants sleeping one in the front row and two others at the rear of the aircraft. They only woke up when the captain announced landing at Siem Reap Airport!
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,,,2,no,4,Long haul from Paris CDG to Hanoi. Good food on board but service of flight attendants and inflight entertainment is very poor. Have also flown with them domestic and no comments therefore. Flights always on time and good service. Will never fly long haul with them again.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Our return flight from Saigon to Gatwick on 22 March 2013 was delayed by 8 hours. When we arrived at Saigon from Da Nang we were met in the arrivals area and were very quickly and efficiently transported to the Park Royal Hotel where we allocated a pleasant room and given vouchers for dinner and breakfast. Next morning an alarm call woke us and after breakfast we were mini-bussed to the Airport and boarded our flight for a very smooth ride back to the UK. It all worked like clockwork!
,,,Business Class,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,3,no,2,"Recently travelled from MEL to HCMC then returned from Hanoi to HCMC and onwards to Melbourne. On the trip from HCMC to Melbourne we were less than impressed. The stewardesses made a great show of coming around to take our meal orders then proceeded to bring the meals out one at a time. By the time they reached us (we were in the centre in row 3) they had run out of our chosen meal so we were given the choice of pho or instant noodles - not what I would consider ""Business Class"" food! There was only one toilet in this cabin. We were not impressed with this airline."
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,,Sydney to Frankfurt on return London to HCMC for a holiday then HCMC back to Sydney. Check in - despite the flight having the same flight number all the way to Hanoi we were told at business class checking that we needed a visa for our transit! Because the HCMC to Hanoi sector was domestic! $137 and a very stressful hour later we had our visa's. No apologies from VA staff that their itinerary gave no indication of this. Land in HCMC and have to go through immigration and customs - at peak arrival time then change to the domestic terminal. Back through more security to finally connect with our flight to Hanoi and onto Frankfurt. On the return we should have known better but get to Gatwick buy our duty free and then find our we are transiting in Frankfurt (again same flight number no mention of transit on our itinerary). Because our boarding pass made no mention of a transit the duty free staffer did not seal our French champagne - consequently we lost it to the German Customs authorities. Even the map in the airline magazine shows direct flights from Gatwick! Finally on our last leg of our journey now travelling with 2 of our kids. We tried to get all of us into the business lounge and were prepared to pay for the kids. But no we could come in they could pay $30 each but had to use another lounge. The lounge was virtually empty it's not as if they were taking valuable seats! Business class seats are not proper beds - not even close - they are hard as nails and the food was awful. Never again! We booked eight people with this airline and it was a massive mistake.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,,,4,no,4,HCMC-Hanoi in economy. Check in at domestic airport staff are not so friendly but did the job. As an elite plus member of sky team you do have sky priority service but can not bring a friend. Vietnam airline also refused Skyteam Elite Plus member to access its lounge. I have to pay 18 dollars to use the lounge. Boarding was smooth 777-200 aircraft has best economy seat. No AVOD program during the 2 hours flight. Cabin crew did the basic work and nothing really special food was pretty average as well only coke and water available. We landed in Hanoi on time luggage out not too long after we landed but my luggage was so wet even the clothes and shoes inside are wet. It is definitely a basic airline and totally 3 star.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,We travelled Australia to Frankfurt via HCM and London to Australia via Hanoi and cannot complain. We were met in HCM taken through airport to hotel for 8 hr layover fed and taken back to Airport. On way back London Gatwick via Frankfurt to Australia we had great crew good meals. Yes seats not lie flat but good all the same. Service was friendly especially on Hanoi-Sydney leg. Yes planes not the newest but great leg room and food good. Overall would highly recommend them as alternative Australia to UK Europe Airline. Bonus if Flying Business class out of Sydney you use the Qantas Business lounge at Sydney.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,4,yes,8,We flew 4 legs between Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh and Ho Chi Minh and Cam Ranh. All the airplanes were new and reasonably clean. Sufficient leg room. Service was efficient though not overly friendly. We got the special meals we had asked for on the international leg. Flights were pretty much on time and check in was quick and easy. Baggage arrived without much delay. No complaints.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Flew several domestic flights and BKK-HCMC. Domestic flights on new A320 only bottled water offered. Staff friendly As a Sky team elitePlus member no access to lounge on domestic flights however they do offer Sky priority at check in. No mileage for lowest booking classes but tickets were very cheap. From BKK to HCMC a small hot meal was offered and variety of drinks including beer was available. Lounge in BKK shared with AF/KL and offered a variety of drinks and quite descent food. All in all a 3* product.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,SGN to Colombo and return. Smiling staff and friendly service. A pretty good meal on a fairly short flight with beer and wine included. Clean spiffy if not new Airbus equipment on both legs. Highly recommended.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,Ho Chi Minh to Bangkok. Flight time is so short (~65 mins) but full service with food tea and coffee. Cabin attendants but take care passenger well. Entertainment is nothing should have some short videos for relax.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,4,Melbourne to HCMC on the 30th of April. Absolutely fabulous and best value for money. On time great food smiling attentive service clean plane and clean toilet. Vietnam makes a nice stopover on the way to Europe and all in all a great way to fly.
,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,,,3,no,4,London-Ho Chi Minh-Danang-Ho Chi Minh-Frankfurt-London. Flew out premium economy to Ho Chi Minh. I was presently surprised. Premium economy seats had a lot of leg room and separate cabin. Service very good food acceptable drinks brought constantly they did run out of gin beer and sparkling wine. However we went to the rear galley of economy and they let us help ourselves to the bottle! Sandwiches also served. Crew were pleasant sometimes off hand. However as tvs don't work and the plane is in need of refurbishment. Both internal flights in economy newer clean planes service good left on time. Return flight via Frankfurt upgraded to business with option town resulted in return journey costing only £140 more each than premium. Lots of leg room seat not flat but enabled us to sleep. Food ok service good at meal and drinks time but didn't see them for 6 hours - everyone was sleeping. Most of the plane was held together by tape and it was dirty. TV worked in business but kept falling over! Not sure I would fly with them again.
,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Back to Germany from SGN to FRA on B777-300 in Economy Deluxe. There's nothing negative to say about the flight - I could sleep all the time between dinner and breakfast. Food service was good and for the night every passenger got a bottle of water. If you want to have anything else to drink the crew reacted very soon and come to the seat.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,Flying from FRA to SIN via HAN on board B777-200 and A321. The crew on the long haul flight from FRA to HAN was very friendly and attentive. The food and beverages were more than enough with a very good choice between different kinds of meals. The staff in Hanoi was very helpful and guided me personally to the transfer counter and the security check - so everything was easy to find. The short flight from HAN to SIN (2.5 hours) on A321 was excellent. Staff were friendly and cared about passengers. Beside the short flight there were printed menu cards and a choice between three menus. Both flights were on time and gave me a very good impression of VNA.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,0,no,,The long haul from Gatwick to Ho Chi Min City was appalling. We took off at 12 noon were fed at about 1pm (barely edible) we hardly saw a member of the cabin crew until they gave us breakfast 10 hours later. The inflight entertainment did not function and the end of the arm rest was broken and with sharp edges protruding it was reluctantly taped at the third time of asking. The cabin lights were turned off until we were given breakfast. They were treating it as a night flight. The seat was uncomfortable and the general condition of the plane was shabby and grubby. It was a dreadful trip the cabin crew when they did appear were unhelpful at best. Their internal flights were much better. Counter staff said there were no premium economy seats available this was untrue.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,2,no,3,London Gatwick - Hanoi - Ho Chi Minh - London Gatwick. Direct flights and choice of seats are the only positive points. Crew are quite surly and as said before not seen for hours after meals are served. On both flights one of our screens was not working as were quite a few others. When people called the crew they kept saying they will reboot the system but never came back to check so we assumed that either they did not bother looking into it or they knew it was hopeless! Also we flew over 2 different months but the films were not changed with limited choice. Food was awful both Asian or Western style and drinks choice limited. Will not fly again with Vietnam Airlines and will not recommend.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,1,no,,LGW to Hanoi. Very poor flight no entertainment on any of the screens plane scruffy toilets dirty staff not seen unless dishing out food and drink very small amount of drink given and only came round once. Seats very small and not much leg room and I am only 5ft 2. Internal flights were 100 per cent better. Would not fly with Vietnam Airlines long haul again. Flight home to LGW was no better.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,no,2,London Gatwick Ho Chi Minh City economy. Only airline offering (twice weekly) direct flight but service so poor advise avoiding. The food was OK no drink offered beforehand wine with meal was less than half full plastic beaker the crew disappeared for next 8 hours. Worse they first shut the window blinds and turned off the lights - it was 12 noon departure from London but crew presumably on Vietnam + 6 hours time - and the overhead lights didn't work. Called crew who confirmed they don't work thanks and failed to understand the concept of reporting a fault. And the entertainment system didn't work so 8 hours in the dark in undersized seat with no entertainment or reading light. Fortunately we had two torches so read by torch light. Traveller's tip : take a miner's lamp if you fly Vietnam Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,Overall the flights were good except for our trip home. The plane looked like it hadn't been serviced there were crumbs still on the floor and dirty marks on the screens and trays. Staff did what they needed and were pleasant. When checking in I asked for a window seat not on the wings I still got seated right on top of the wings maybe a language barrier but this did happen on 3 occasions. The internal flights in Vietnam were fine.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,I fly VN502/503 HCMC to BAIYUN Guangzhou at least 2 times per month for the last 2 years. Tan Son Nhat airport is very busy with tourists Vietnam airlines check-in staff are incredibly slow and unfriendly. 3 Business Class check-in counters remain open and free not processing the very long lines of economy passengers that often delay these flights. Always have to stand on a hot crowded jam packed bus on the tarmac before and after each flight. Aircraft dirty toilets disgusting on these VN to China flights. Cabin Crew surly unhelpful and safety is not a priority. Food is horrible. Cabin attendants disappear after shovelling the food out.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,1,no,,Long haul flight from Gatwick to Ho Chi Min in an old aircraft. Apart from dishing out obligatory drink and meals did not see cabin crew until time to land. They seemed indifferent and uninterested in passenger welfare or need. Had to help ourselves to drinks (as did other passengers from a tray left in serving place). Cabin crew were solemn faced. Would not fly again or recommend.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,2,no,,Sydney-Saigon. Aircraft seemed pretty new. Everything worked. Food of adequate standard. On time. Seat pretty cramped but typical. Service polite and efficient but not friendly. Saigon-Hanoi: Old clunky aircraft. Video screens and audio did not work properly. Meal not heated properly. Hanoi-Hoi An: Cambodian Air plane. Seemed pretty new. Everything worked Only water and wipes on one hour flight. Hoi An - Saigon: Old clunky aircraft. Only water and wipes on this flight. Saigon - Sydney: Another old aircraft. Seat old. Delayed half hour. A hole in armrest where some button had once been. Screen small and would not stow in seat. Picture on screen poor. Games control button deeply encrusted with filth. Edge of tray broken and very uncomfortable to use. Food was served hot and of acceptable quality. Fairly cramped and uncomfortable. Usual efficient service.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,yes,7,Singapore to Hanoi return. An acceptable service for the money paid staff tried really hard aircraft getting on a bit so entertainment poor for a 3hr flight but not a deal clincher. Would certainly fly Vietnam again.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,Business on domestic flights excellent with real BC seat. On the international flight from Hanoi to Paris we disliked the seat very hard an angle of only 156° decades behind other Asian carriers. Food very mediocre and limited choice. No wine list and asking for a dry white Bordeaux we got a dessert wine. We refused it and was changed for a white burgundy. The VOD was not working so sleeping was the only impossible alternative but seen the poor seat and with the passenger in front almost on your knees makes sleeping almost impossible.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,,,2,no,2,I travelled back home in business class with a broken collarbone and ribs on the flight form Ho Chi Minh City to Paris. Although I was mentioned as a passenger needing medical assistance I never got any support from staff on the plane. Upon arrival the other passengers had to help me get with hand luggage and with my clothes. I find this absolutely unacceptable.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,,3,yes,6,SIN-HAN. Experience ok food good. Took over an hour and a half to collect meal trays after service. Leading to a 20+ person queue for bathrooms. Hostess's did job without being friendly or smiling. Left and landed on time.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,HKK - Hanoi on 30th Jan then Hanoi-Danang 1st Feb Danang-BKK (via HCM) on Feb 7th. All routes were on relatively new looking A321s or A320s. International service was good with decent entertainment and food. Flights from their hubs (Hanoi and HCM) were on time but our Danang-HCM leg was delayed 90 mins with no explanation. We had lounge access in HCM which was comfortable though the drinks selection was poor. Danang airport was very nice in contrast to HCM and Hanoi especially - very old and a terrible waiting area for domestic flights. The HCM domestic-international transfer requires you to leave switch terminals by walking outside. Overall however a good experience and recommended for domestic/regional routes.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,,5,yes,9,In Feb 2013 we took four flights with VN and two with their codeshare partner Cambodia Angkor Air (49% owned by VN). These flights were SIN-HAN HAN-HUI HUI-SGN SGN - REP and return (K6 flights) and SGN- SIN. We were travelling in Business Class but we were very impressed with VN's (and K6's) overall performance. AF and KLM could learn from the way in which VN handle priority boarding and (except on one flight) baggage handling. A couple of the A321s were brand new the others in good condition. The food was well judged for the length of flight and time of day. We had supper in Hanoi with friends who had travelled LGW-HAN the previous night one couple in Business Clas one in Premium Economy (called De Luxe by VN). Their comments backed up those who refer to IFE systems not working on VN's long-haul flights.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,LGW-HAN and SGN to LGW. Both flights departed and arrived on time. No problem getting window seats / seats together no unexpected stops. Crew did their jobs to an 'acceptable' standard one or two were quite good. Upholstery had seen better days and the first set of headphones we got on the way out were dodgy. Food was fine - two choices at each meal and no problem pre-ordering a vegetarian meal. Films were 2012 releases and a new one on me they have selectable camera views from the cockpit and beneath the plane which can be quite dramatic during take-off and landing. Direct flights saved us a lot of time and airline choice saved us a lot of money - would definitely use again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,5,no,8,SGN to Danang return on Airbus 321. Avoid seat 39 on the starboard bulkhead. It does not recline. Clean airplanes and OK cabin staff. Return flight to SGN left 30 minutes late because of late equipment arrival which seems to happen a lot with VN Air later in the day. Insipid annoying background music while boarding and disembarking. Every carrier plays it and I do not understand why. My inflight experience is certainly not enhanced.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Very good direct flights Gatwick to Hanoi and then Ho Chi Min back to Gatwick both direct. Seats were comfortable despite 10 hours one way and 12 coming back. Service very good.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,Awful experience. Had an early morning flight from Phu Quoc to Ho Chi Minh City with a connecting flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Da Nang. The plane never turned up and passengers were told an hour after departure time that the flight had been cancelled with no announcements prior to this. Went to the service counter to ask to be put on the next flight to Ho Chi Minh but were told we were not in the system so there was nothing they would do. Service staff were extremely rude and unhelpful. Next flight left and we finally got put on a flight later that day by which time we had missed our connecting flight. The later flight was also delayed 2 hours with barely any explanation made to passengers.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,Very happy with the flight and the service. Excellent value for money! London Gatwick to Hanoi but both outward and return flights ran to time there was adequate legroom and the food and service was very good. True there did seem to be the odd screen that was stuck on games and we also had the same films on the way back as those seen 3 weeks earlier but since the return flight left at midnight and arrived at 6.30 it didn't matter. The landing at Gatwick with a full plane was one of the most gentle I have ever experienced. In terms of value this was unbeatable! I would definitely fly with VA again. We also took short flights to Luang Prabang and from Siem Reap and again very punctual.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,,5,yes,8,HKG-SGN-HKG in Business Class. I was completely satisfied with the service on-time performance and food and wine. On the Ho Chi Minh City-Hong Kong flight the service was exceptional with a charm efficiency and elegance rarely found with the larger major world airlines these days. The lunch menu was remarkable with 3 good choices covering Asian and Western needs. Both my flights that I travelled on were exactly on time. The only downside to the flights was the use of a shared 'business lounge' in Hong Kong. However the Vietnam Airlines lounge at Saigon Airport is perfectly fine for working and for refreshments. From this experience I think I shall look to use VN Airlines for business travel again.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,5th December 2012 LGW to Hanoi. On time departure extra leg room seat as requested entertainment not great - very tired but food was good and staff were friendly. All in all excellent value for money. These are the first of the 777s so need a refit sooner rather than later but all in all pretty good service.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,2,no,2,Business class SGN-SYD 28/1. Traveling alone with 2 children. I booked 3 seats in a row 3A 3C and 3D. Plan was to sit 2 year old next to window as quiet and dark and therefore hopefully (for everyone's sake) she would sleep! At departure gate I was told seat 3A is broken and given new boarding cards all in different parts of the cabin. I explained my 2 year old could not sit alone however no alternative could be found except me in the 'broken' seat next to her. Cant understand why departure staff could not have rearranged seating prior to gate to accommodate us together. IFE terrible seats even those that worked were hard and uncomfortable. This airline is deteriorating each year.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,6,Flew on a range of domestic and international flights: Hanoi-Nha Trang-Ho Chi Minh City-Melbourne. The HAN-NHA flight was terrible. The plane was hot and the meal was horrible. The second flight from NHA-SGN was only a short flight. The planes were clean on both domestic legs. On the international flight from SGN- MEL the A330-200 was extremely cramped. The food was reasonably good. The AVOD is poor however and constantly freezes despite the cabin crew's best efforts to fix it. The cabin crew were quite friendly on this leg.
,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,In past 6 months i have flown 6 international flights and 4 domestic flights with Vietnam Airlines. Have flown Frankfurt to Hanoi return. Hanoi to Nha Trang. Hanoi to Da Nang. and Hanoi to Bangkok return. Very friendly staff and excellent food onboard. Will be flying them again soon to Hanoi.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,January 5 2013. LGW-SGN-DAD / HUI-SGN-LGW. Swissport ground staff at LGW very unapproachable and cold faced. Boarding was smooth at least. Vietnam Airlines operate very tired looking 777-200ers 3-3-3 config. Cabin crew on all sectors were unfriendly and lacked common knowledge of the English language. LGW-SGN flight left on time and lunch was thrown out by the crew with a selection of drinks. Inflight entertainment is a small screen with about 4 channels if they are working. Don't bother using your call bell we did not see the crew in the cabin for about 9 hours. Prior to take off none of the crew checked seatbelts / seats upright / electronic equipment etc. Seatbelt sign came on throughout the flight which nobody checked. Upon Landing baggage was in the aisles blankets not stowed away. Vietnam airlines domestic product is dreadful - old A321s and no service on a 1hr 20 flight - a bottle of water and a wet wipe. HUI-LGW via SGN - similarly dissatisfied service flights on time to say the least. Cabin was extremely hot on SGN-LGW sector asked 3 times to turn it down but this request ignored. I shall never travel with them again.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,,,5,yes,9,SGN-BKK-SGN A321. Both flights were on time. Service was excellent and the staff very friendly and enthusiastic. Though the flight time was only about 1.5 hours VN provides a choice between two different meals and many different beverages. A good choice for travel within South East Asia.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,London Gatwick to Hanoi return. On the way out there were no PTVs the mainscreen TV's did not work the cabin was incredibly hot and the toilet behind my seat was broken. The seats were in poor condition. On arrival we waited over an hour for our baggage with no explanation or apology. I paid for a standby upgrade option on the way back and asked to upgrade to business class at the Vietnam Airlines desk in Hanoi airport but was told it was full. I later discovered this not to be the case. Only mainscreen TV's on the way back although the TV in the aisle did work this time. There were no midflight snack sandwiches on this flight but the Asian option of pot noodles I did not want. On arrival to LGW we were told that not all the baggage had been put on the plane and were given forms to fill in. We spent 4 hours in the airport queuing to hand in our forms.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,HCMC - Paris. Though VN Airlines say they have web check in the facility on their website does not function and they have no web check-in desks at the airport. Entertainment non existent and silence from the flight deck. Minimal food/beverages provided and all in all a long boring and uncomfortable flight - not to be recommended.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,,,4,yes,7,We used Vietnam Airlines for 2 domestic flights and one short international flight (Hanoi-Siam Reap). All flights were on time and used fairly new Airbus aircraft. Legroom was quite limited but no worse than other short haul flights. Inflight service was limited to a small bottle of water on the domestic flights; we got a small meal on the international flight but the quality was very poor even by airline food standards. I suggest eating beforehand - though not at the airport as options for food/drink at airports in Vietnam were surprisingly bad for a country with such great food. I bought the tickets on the Vietnam Airlines website without any problems; the domestic flights were very good value (about $60 each) the international flights rather less so.
,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,London Gatwick to HCMC on 19 Dec 2012 returned 5 Jan 2013. Booked seats in Deluxe Economy giving you a little more seat space and leg room. As soon as we boarded (both flights on time) and took our seats we were offered juice or water and a cold towel wipe. Staff brought round the menu's and you could chose from an Asian or European style meal. The food was good and you got metal cutlery! You could also chose drinks from beers wines spirits soft drinks - all free of charge. After dinner the lights dimmed enabling you to sleep and take advantage of the complimentary pillows and blankets or make use of the in-flight entertainment with complimentary headphones. During the flight staff didn't always come round sometimes you had to go to them or press your attention button. A couple of hours from the end of the flight breakfast was served again a choice between an Asian or European style meal. Overall our flight was great I would definitely fly with them again and upgrading to Deluxe Economy seems to be the way forward. We also had an internal flight from Nha Trang to HCMC this was 30 mins delayed but staff were friendly and the flight was good.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,,,4,yes,8,DAD-SGN. Short flight from Da Nang to Saigon on new A320 aircraft. Our original flight was cancelled so we were put on the later flight. Fearing we would miss our connection to Dubai at Ho Chi Minh we suggested we all take more hand luggage. Check in people said they would ensure our bags got there quickly and gave our checked bags business class tags and put us near the front of the plane. Service on board was simple but acceptable for short flight. Very comfortable. When we landed we were all allowed to travel with the business customers on the first coach to the baggage reclaim. Bags were first off within 3 minutes of arriving. Very impressed. We did not miss our connection!
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,1,no,,LGW-BKK via SGN. Plane was very old and looked unclean. Seats were rock hard and leg room was insufficient due to some a box under the seat in front of me. No entertainment apart from big screen at front of plane. Food and staff on board ok. At check in I asked for exit row seats and was told they were all taken I couldn't understand as I was first in the queue for check in and there was no web check in. Would not recommend.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,3,yes,9,Flew economy on domestic A321 from Danang to Hanoi. Plane was in a good condition. Leg space was really good more than larger carriers' economy class. Though it was a short flight no food was provided. A packet of snacks or a sandwich would be great. Service was good. Flight was smooth. The only thing was that the flight I originally booked for was cancelled so I had to take the later flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,no,,Flew Gatwick - Bangkok (via Hanoi) and returned via Ho Chi Minh City. Going out was fine flight was fine food fine although entertainment system awful and old about 3 choices of film which for a 13 hour flight is not sufficient. Coming home awful. Woman dropped my boyfriends passport down the side of her desk finally mechanics came and took the desk apart and found the passport. Got to Ho Chi Minh City was 9.30pm flight to Gatwick was due to be midnight but had been delayed to 9am next day. Waited 3 hours in airport to be told what was going on not offered any water no shops to buy anything. Then taken to a hotel. The next day coming back sat around for 2 hours without being told what was going on. No apologies or anything. The most disorganised airline. Will never use again.
,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,3,yes,8,PRG-CDG-HAN skyteam elite member. Economy class segment: PRG-CDG on Airbus a321. Seat ok. Had emergency exit seat (not upon request). No seat in front so leg space enough. No view outside due to lack of window. 4 small biscuits as a snack - poor for a 1.5 hr flight. Stopover in CDG: a nice 30 min walk between the 2 gates. In the mean time went to the check in counter to ask for a window seat. Upon arrival at the gate I asked about the seat and immediately received upgrade to economy plus cabin. I took advantage of the possibility to go to the Air France lounge. Seat was great legroom more than ok. Food is as usual on VN very good. Rice noodles upon request during the night. PTV (a little outdated system that takes time to get along with). Overall a good experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,,Just had a return trip LGW-BKK out via Hanoi return via HCMC. Outward flight was approx 1 hour late from LGW within an hour of the flight we had been given the food! Menu for the opposite direction and I had sussed out my in flight entertainment didn't work when meals were served I was asked what I wanted from the menu! I told them and they didn't have it the correct menu was taped to the trolley. In Hanoi I had a 3 hour connection you can't change money 'airside' in Vietnam meaning I couldn't eat or drink. Return journey connection was also 3 hours in HCMC but was actually 11.5 hours we were put up in a hotel but it took almost 3 hours for Vietnam airlines to organise it. When we eventually got going there was no apology from cabin crew or captain of plane and arrived LGW 15.20 instead of 06.45 on Dec 1st.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,1,no,,Flew Sydney-HMC-London in September (inflight entertainment did not work). Returned in November (inflight entertainment did not work) seemed like this was pretty normal as none of the cabin crew seemed surprised. Wife became ill on the flight and noticing that there were very few in business class I asked if she could be moved to get some fresher air (just until she felt better) I was given an abrupt 'these seats are only for business class passengers'.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew business class end October Paris-Hanoi-Sydney and Sydney-HCMH-Paris in business class. A main reason for using VN long haul to Asia is that you get 12hrs legs which allows for good time to work eat watch movie and get real night sleep. Love the noodle snack option. 777's are dated the IFE gets changed every couple of months so on my itinerary I quickly ran out of options. You get 6-8 hours transit time in Vietnam allowing a quick visit to downtown. All in all I find VN business service good value for money.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,,,3,yes,5,HAN to HCMC return. Cabin crew were friendly provided food and drinks on request. Aircraft was okay and the in-flight entertainment was old and did not work both ways. The food was fine although they did run up of the European option as it was popular on the return flight. I will not fly long haul with this airline again however we had a good experience of an internal flight which I will comment separately. All luggage was received promptly.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,,,4,yes,8,Travelled SIN-Hanoi and Hanoi-SIN on an A321. The aircraft was new and seats also new and comfortable. There is no personal entertainment set but the flight was short so it was ok. The service was only passable female staff were good and patient but the male staff were slow in responding to requests. Food was pretty good but portions are small. Overall a good airline. Plane left on time and landed early on both occasions but the landings were all terrible.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,no,3,London Gatwick To Bangkok via Ho Chi Minh. Glad that I'd read previous reviews which are pretty accurate. Would also add that you get what you pay for! The flight was smooth but departed a little late and plane looked a bit the worse for wear. The flight the inflight entertainment stopped working which appears to be very common. I was prepared and had my iPad etc to entertain me. Lunch and breakfast provided and were average. In between times nothing else was offered in fact most passengers went to gallery and were offered pot noodles and people helped themselves to drinks too. Also two toilets were out of order. Ho Chi Minh to BKK was the opposite and we had one of tastiest meals more legroom newer plane. A disappointing experience and would not choose to fly with them again - except we have a return flight!
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,LGW-HCMC 1/12/12 - Flight was 5 hours delayed whilst awaiting boarding advised we would be further delayed. Finally boarded flight - firstly discovered av equipment was not working screen jammed on child's game no option to shut screen off completely. Having read previously reviews I ensured I had sufficient reading material. However raised matter with cabin crew - response was a shrug of the shoulders from first member of staff. Discovered the overhead reading light also not working so despite having a back up plan this fell foul of Vietnam Airlines also. The member of staff returned to me a period of time later advising she had spoken to the purser who informed that no options for an upgrade or alternative seating were to be offered. Managed to utilise inflight newspapers to cover screen which was not attended to by staff. I do not believe that the cost of my flight was particularly low when compared with other airlines. It is unfortunate that my return flight is also with this carrier however I am giving this as little thought as possible to ensure it does not affect my vacation.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,LGW to HCMC return. Outward flight delayed 5hrs due to technical issues with dated B777 aircraft. Cabin crew were unfriendly however did provide food and drinks on request. Aircraft was dirty damage can be seen all around the cabin and the inflight entertainment was old and did not work both ways. Seats are old and uncomfortable however the flight was fairly smooth. Return flight delayed 9hrs due to technical issues with the aircraft again. This was the same aircraft as the outward flight so cabin quality was the same however the cabin crew were better on the return flight and provided a good service. The food was fine although they did run up of the European option as it was popular on the return flight. Due to the delay the airline put passengers up in a hotel overnight which was of a good standard. Final comments are that we were very concerned on the return flight due to the nature of the delays being technical issues with the aircraft and other posts here suggest that this is not unusual on this route. I will not fly long haul with this airline again however we had a good experience of an internal flight which I will comment separately. All luggage was received promptly.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,3,yes,7,HUI-HAN on a newish A321. Left on time and luggage came out fast. Might as well not bother having FAs on board though since all they do is give you a bottle of water and sit down and relax for the rest of the flight. Would be nice to have a few more beverage options if VNA really want to distinguish themselves from competitor airlines. At the very least they should offer tea/coffee.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,4,yes,8,Phu Quoc island to Can Tho - this 40 minute flight was good. The plane seemed new and I would happily fly Vietnam Airways domestic based on this experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,2,no,3,Flew HAN-SGN on an old but clean B777. Flight left on time and luggage came out fast. The inflight food and beverages were a disgrace though. Apparently only water and Pepsi will be served now on this route! Not even a cup of tea or coffee. Frankly this is a disgrace given that the airline have recently increased their fares. Food consisted of a revolting vacuum packed sandwich with low quality meat. Given that they now have more competition than ever on this route you'd think they'd be trying to improve their service not make cut backs and provide their passengers with less options. Very disappointing. The quality of the food in their lounge is also terrible.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,,,3,no,4,Bangkok - HCMC. Plane was fairly new but already showing damage to seats lockers etc. People using phones on takeoff and landing without any action from the crew. On arrival the aircraft was parked (finally after a 15 min delay) far out on the boundary then a further 20 minute delay before disembarkation. The airport ATC is a disaster.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Round-trip from Taipei to Siem Reap via Ho Chi Minh City. No long lines at check-in. All the planes (A321) seemed new inside and out and were quite roomy inside. I am tall and was especially happy with the amount of legroom. All of my seats were almost like Economy Plus seats on United Airlines. All flights left on time and arrived earlier than expected. The flight crew were not particularly friendly but were efficient. I have to say that the last flight was a bit hot and stuffy and I could have used some air conditioning but it wasn't horrible. Our bags were promptly delivered on both legs. It was a good experience overall and I wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,2,Gatwick to Ho Chi Minh City. Flight out was the worst long haul ever. Plane was incredibly hot with no option for any air conditioning. Staff were unhelpful and rude. Inflight entertainment did not work. Return journey was an equal disaster. Flight delayed 9 hours due to problems with the plane. They made no announcements at all and we were just told it was cancelled. They shipped us all off to hotels which took 3 hours and we then had to be back at the airport 4 hours later so no real sleep obtained. On returning to the airport as they had taken our passports off us they then had the task of handing out passports to 300 odd people - no organisation and no idea. In the end passengers took the box of passports off them and dealt with it themselves. Actual flight back was ok and staff were a little more helpful and attentive - not surprising really. Both planes on our journey were dirty.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,6,Flew London to Singapore via Vietnam. Aircraft is in need of a re fit the IFE is the older style and you can't stop start the programs but it worked. Crew friendly and the meals were good.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,3,no,5,Recently used as part of a booking made with Qantas airlines but flying with Vietnam Airlines. The flight to and from was poor with the aircraft in need of some basic maintenance/repairs consoles not working and crew not interested in any complaints or requests. Food sub standard with no choices in what you got. I used the airline for all internal flights within Vietnam which was better that their international flights and pleasant with all aspects of the process without fault. I suppose you pay for what you get. Surprised Qantas putting their name to another airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,My son and I have used Vietnam Airlines several times. Bangkok to Hanoi Hanoi to Hong Kong Vientiane to Phnom Penh and then on to Ho Chi Minh City. No complaints. Good service good food on time no lost luggage and aircraft in excellent condition. I will fly them again this summer from HCMC round-trip to Nha Trang. Nothing to complain about.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,Twice this year I have travelled Vietnam Airlines from Australia to the UK in Business Class. Excellent value for money. The best aircraft are the newer A330-200s cabins in better shape and excellent seat recline when compared to the B77-200s which are looking rather tired. Check in easy lounges fine although nothing special transit procedures in Vietnam well co-ordinated by ground staff. Onboard service is consistent catering excellent wines good AVOD rather limited. Despite these minor criticisms I believe that VN offers the best value for money Business Class option from Australia to the UK at present.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,,4,yes,7,HKG-SGN-DAD-SGN-HKG. My partner and I flew to D'nang with Vietnam airlines. The flight from Hong Kong to Ho Chi Minh was comfortable. We received a full meal service on board even though the flight was only 2 hours long. Ho Chi Minh itself is a bit of a culture shock. You will need to re-check in for domestic flights. Our connecting flight was cancelled but we were put back onto the next flight. They said we could have dinner in their lounge but none of their lounges knew what the desk was on about and by then it was too late to question it as there is no airline desk once in the departure lounge. Any longer than a one our transit in SGN is far too long!
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,,,1,no,,I booked Vietnam Airlines as they are the only company that do direct flights to Vietnam - I was travelling with children and wanted to get to Vietnam in the shortest possible time! The stewards were rude and offhand. Three out of four of our entertainment systems and reading lights didn't work and when we asked to be moved they were uninterested and told us there was nothing that could be done and we should just rest! This was a daytime flight with a 6-year old and a 13-year old. We were told to try and get compensation once we were back home.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,4,yes,9,For price reasons I travelled Vietnam Airlines last week from Paris - Bangkok (via Hanoi) - Sydney (via Ho Chi Minh) - Paris (via Ho Chi Minh). 1 month ago I travelled Paris - Hanoi return as well. Both times Business class. Service excellent food and wine very good selection noodle soups as snacks available throughout the 13 hour flight served by a smiling crew. Only negative is the flight entertainment system which had the same films for all the above cited flights. Crew told me that the programmes only change every 3 to 4 months due to cost reasons - take your own DVDs along.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,4,yes,10,Unremarkable short hop from Vientiane to Phnom Penh. Clean comfortable cabin friendly cabin crew. Belgian (I think) captain gave occasional information.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,,4,yes,9,"SGN to HAN return: Clean 777 each way with competent FA's. Left on time and arrived on time. Vietnam Airlines SMS'd a flight change the way they promised and did so well in advance. Stay away from starboard row 28. There's lots of leg room since it's an exit row but the passenger seats have been ""minimized"" to accommodate flight attendant seating and are a bit snug for an average sized Westerner."
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,3 adults had 4 flights in Business Class Melbourne SGN SGN Moscow Frankfurt SGN SGN Melbourne over September/October. Service on all flights excellent standout was crew on Frankfurt - SGN leg where staff addressed all by name over course of flight. IFE on all flights ok with good range of movies food plentiful and good quality wines good and water provided without request and often. Ground staff helpful in all instances - flights on time and cabins in good shape.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,no,5,Returned from Hanoi on a very worn out B777. Food was passable. When we discovered that all 3 consoles in our row did not work we asked to move as there appeared to be lots of empty seats requested 2 seats together. The crew member said initially that this was not possible but then said that she had found a pair of seats. My husband went to look and by that time someone else had taken the seats another row with one person sprawled across three seats the flight was not full. Eventually the Consoles did work but not for most of the 12 hour flight when it did finally work I missed the last 45 minutes of a film as the crew collected the headphones. Waited for the loo for ages told a crew member that someone had been in there for a long time and hoped they were OK. Steward knocked on door no response so he opened it to discover it empty problem with a broken lock! I don't think it was used after that.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew SGN-HAN on a relatively old but well enough maintained B777. Food was pretty good and the FAs were pleasant. Flight left on time and luggage came out quickly. My only complaint is about the standard of food in the business class lounge. Otherwise very good.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,I flew SYD-SGN-HAN-SGN then REP-SGN-SYD and was pleasantly surprised by Vietnam Airlines. The planes on the long haul sections were fairly new and comfortable with good inflight entertainment systems. Planes on the short haul sections were older with no inflight entertainment. Service was good on all flights the planes were clean and the food ranged from good to very good.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,4,no,4,Flew from London Gatwick to HCMC and from Hanoi to London Gatwick. On both journeys the inflight entertainment was broken leading to two very long and boring 12 hour flights. When we asked the air crew they reacted as if this was a constant problem and apologized that there was nothing they could do. That apart the food was a decent standard the staff were very friendly legroom was adequate but not ideal (6ft Male). The aircraft were very dated B777 with lots of broken consoles seats and even components held together with duct tape. We would use them again but only if there was no alternative.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Absolutely terrible service over 48hr delay in Gatwick with little to no information provided on when/how we would get to fly to our destination. Missed a 3 day stop over in Ho Chi Minh because of this delay and the service by staff was extremely disappointing. No benefits offered when we did finally get on a new flight lots of incorrect flight information provided and generally treated disgracefully by the airline. I was not provided with a Gluten Free meal which I requested (and require for health reasons) and we had broken entertainment systems for the 12hr leg of our journey. I would not recommend flying Vietnam Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,Flew from London Gatwick to Hanoi to Saigon to HUE to Nha Trang and back to Saigon and back home and I would say that Vietnam airline is a good airline if you want a cheap flight to Southeast Asia. Staff are friendly and the food is at a good standard. Seat comfort is what you would expect for economy. Entertainment is okay but on the first flight the entertainment broke so had to entertain myself for 12 hours but overall if you want a cheap flight to Southeast Asia then I would recommend Vietnam Airlines.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,4,no,2,Flew Melbourne to Paris return in business class. Extremely mediocre food and service on all legs bar the Paris back to Hanoi flight where they attempted to offer you your next course only once you had finished eating the one before. On all other flights the trays were presented in their entirety with offers of a first glass of wine along with tea or coffee - this on an 11 hour daytime flight. Still the cost was cheap and much lower than other airlines. It still wouldn't convince me to travel again with Vietnam as on every sector my arm rest was held together with duct tape on one flight part of the overhead panels were also being held together with duct tape and on the 2 different aircraft's I flew on the seats were uncomfortable. The foot rests only raised off the ground marginally so even when the seat back was in full recline your body is at a crazy angle - not conducive for sleeping. One positive note - ground staff in Hanoi and HCMC (Saigon) were first class.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,5,We booked our flight in April to fly direct from Gatwick to HCM. The inflight entertainment was hit and miss - I'd say about 50% on the back seat screens probably had some sort of problem. Food on the flight out was better than the return and the staff although polite on the way out were friendlier on our return. The seats and leg room were what you would expect from economy class. Both of our flights left and arrived on time. My only real gripe with VA is that nowhere through the online booking process did it state that we needed a visa for Vietnam. Having looked again at their site it is still very unclear.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,SYD-SGN-SYD. Really nice flights. The food was fairly good but some meals were just plain. The seats were fairly wide and had a larger than usual amount of leg-space which I appreciated. Unlike some other airlines the seats didn't make me fidget or get up as often as others and they were quite comfortable to sleep in for economy. Overall a great airline to fly to SE Asia.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,London Gatwick to Bangkok via Hanoi. No online check in but can check in at least 5 hours before flight at London Gatwick. Food ok. Staff friendly and Hanoi airport is cheap. Some shops don't except Pounds. A great airline at a great price. The fare was only £80 but with tax and fees it came to £480.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,1,Flying Gatwick to Bangkok: First flight cabin crew stingy with drinks and coffee. All crew seemed miserable and keen to get lights off so that they could ignore you. My sons entertainment console locked up and despite repeated requests crew did nothing. Crew managed to ignore the attention light for a good 30 minutes. Second flight eating tray was broken so could not sit together as a family. Return flight entertainment console broken so either sit apart or no entertainment. Same level of miserable service. When meal served one side of the plane got top up drinks and other didn't suggesting lax systems. Would avoid unless cheaper than any other airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,7,SYD-SGN-CDG and returning CDG-HAN-SGN-SYD. Food in-flight movies and service of a good standard for price. Australia-Europe travellers be aware that the return journey had a domestic Hanoi to Saigon leg that added hours to the journey and required a transit visa. Vietnam Airlines provided a Hanoi hotel for the 10 hour stopover - making it bearable - and arranged for transit visa with US$25 cash on arrival. However aggressive Air France staff in Paris attempted to block us boarding as we had no written evidence of a transit visa. Only after a series of frantic phone calls was clearance given.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,2,no,4,VN921 from VTE to SGN. Vietnam Airlines have monopolized this route and despite charging top dollar didn't even provide food or alcoholic beverages. The flight stops off in PNH where everybody has to get off and wait and we were delayed. Staff were generally friendly and welcoming although the purser was very unreceptive when I asked why food and alcoholic beverages were not provided.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Travelled from FRA to SGN in 777 and SGN to SIN in A321. Flight from FRA to SGN was good and the service was excellent. For dinner and breakfast there was a great choice between different meals food tasted good and was more than enough. The transfer in SGN was easy. The staff at the transfer counter were friendly and had already my boarding pass to SIN and the lounge invitation ready for me. So no waiting time at the counter. The 2 hours flight from SGN to SIN was eventless and good. For lunch there was a choice between 3 different meals and staff was friendly.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,2,no,3,Travelled from Melbourne to Hanoi return the flight over was very good on an A330. Service was great and very comfortable seats. Unfortunately the return flight was on a B777 the economy section was crowded with very old seats with no personal entertainment screens. Seats had a particularly hard section (meeting your lower back) and did not recline at all. The internal electric's were not working so our section could not turn on or off personal lights contact service crew etc and to make matters worse one light was permanently on and could not be turned off. My partner had a small box for some sort of wiring in his foot space. We were very pleased with the flight over and the two domestic flights but the return trip was the worst flight we have been on the staff did their best but the economy section in the B777 needs to be refurbished asap.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew from Melbourne to HCM return (8.5 hours each leg). The plane (Airbus 330) was full going over and it left and arrived on time. It was an uneventful flight with the crew efficiently serving meals and regularly coming around with drinks (water juice etc). The entertainment was reasonable although we flew three weeks apart and the movie selection had not changed in that time. On the return trip (mid week) the plane was only one third full. I am 6 foot tall and found the seats / legroom okay for an economy class seat. I would fly with them again.
