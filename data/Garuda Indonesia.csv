The showers are not cleaned between 2 passengers. The boarding experience is chaotic. Just before boarding the plane we are asked to leave our water bottles at the gate (which does not make any sense as we've already been through security). The cabin crew is unfriendly, the seats and toilets are dirty and the footrest is uncomfortable as it eats your legroom. No comment or excuses from the crew after a 1 hour delay. It seemed to be normal."

As it was a late-night flight the lounge was not that busy, however there were sufficient snacks, food and hot and colds drinks available. Boarding was orderly; however, it seems that Garuda lets people board with quite a lot of hand luggage, and I saw some large size cases as well which I believe should have been checked in as they took up too much space in the overhead storage bins. It was an overnight flight; however, the seats were reasonably comfortable. The cabin crew was efficient and welcoming, after takeoff they came around and offered a small meal and some hot & drinks. Not the best, however sufficient. We landed in Sorong on time and baggage came out very quickly. Overall, not a bad flight."

We arrived in Jakarta on schedule and when the aircraft door was opened, I was met by Vianda from the Garuda PSA Team who escorted me through immigration, baggage collect, customs and assisted me in getting a taxi. Thank you very much Vianda. My conclusion is that the onboard flight and ground services in Jakarta were outstanding, however these we let down by the long check in times and lack of lounge access in Tokyo Haneda airport. I note that Garuda uses a local company at Haneda to help with the check in process, however that should not be an excuse."

I had originally booked a direct flight from Melbourne to Jakarta, months later I was rebooked to a flight Via Denpasar (Bali). I completed online check in but, was unable to print my boarding pass. Once i arrived the airport check in was efficient. Melbourne to Denpasar was an older aircraft with signs of aging showing. Seats comfortable as my meal was very tasty and the crew friendly and efficient. I found the transfer in Bali to be very confusing! No clear signage and no domestic recheck counter. Denpasar to Jakarta brand new A330 neo. Boarding was chaotic as the sign for the row numbers was held way out of sight for people at the back of line, Instead of walking along the line to assist with boarding. Aircraft was brand new with great seats and a fantastic Business product, Meal was very tasty and Crew were very nice. I hope that the A330 neo will be deployed on the Australia routes. They would have a superior product to their competitors. App and website need a serious update as well as the transfer procedures in Denpasar. I will probably fly Garuda again and I hope to see their new cabins to Australia soon!"

✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300,Business,Business Class,Denpasar to Sydney,October 2023,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,"  I recently enjoyed a pleasure flight, and I must say that the service truly stood out as the most remarkable aspect of my journey. It's no surprise that Garuda Indonesia was awarded as The World's Best Cabin Crew. The attentiveness and professionalism of cabin crew made the experience enjoyable and memorable. Starting with the positive aspects, the welcome drink and bottle of water provided on the ground were appreciated. However, including a small sweet treat, such as a piece of candy or some snacks, would have added a delightful touch to the welcome service. On this flight, I requested a seafood meal. The first service commenced approximately 25 minutes after take-off, during which a starter of salmon tart was served. Before the lights were turned out, which was approximately an hour after take-off, the second service began. I received a tuna sandwich as a light snack or an in-between course. One of the cabin crew accidentally offered me a regular meal, and I opted for the chicken pie, resulting in my receiving two snacks. Despite this, it enhanced my dining experience satisfaction. In terms of the meal schedule, I suggest serving a hot meal during the light snack or in-between course service, not just during breakfast or the pre-landing meal. This adjustment would provide passengers with a satisfying dinner option and contribute to a more comfortable journey pace. Approximately halfway through the journey, juice service was provided. Integrating the light snack or in-between course during the juice service, midway through the flight, could better align with passengers' hunger levels and create a more seamless dining experience. About an hour and 50 minutes prior to landing, breakfast or a pre-landing meal was served, which consisted of appetizers and a hot meal. For the appetizer, I received mixed fruit, yogurt, a bread roll accompanied by strawberry jam and butter. For the hot meal, I was served stir-fry noodles with sweet and sour seafood. Overall, my journey with Garuda Indonesia was made truly memorable by the outstanding service and thoughtful meal offerings."

Check in was in Changi Terminal-3, however the aircraft departed from Terminal-1, therefore there was long walk to change terminals and use the Skytrain. As GA823 flight is an early morning departure check in opened at 05:15am. There was one business class check-in desk open, however I would say that the check-in staff was not very friendly in fact a little abrupt and not your typical Garuda-Indonesia warm service, however I note that Garuda-Indonesia uses a 3rd party service company in Singapore. The boarding gate was at Gate 26 Terminal which is right at the end of the Terminal. Security was reasonable and fast, when it came time for boarding the process was acceptable. The flight itself was good and the cabin crew quite helpful and very friendly. There was three choices food being offered and I chose the omelet, and it was served by tea and soft rolls and was more that acceptable. We arrived in Jakarta ahead of schedule and I was meet at the aircraft door by Garuda premium service team who escorted to the baggage area and through customs and on to my car . Garuda-Indonesia keeps providing a consistent high level of service; however, I would recommend that they speak with their service Company in Singapore to be a little more friendly at the check-in counters."

I chose a glass of champagne. Additionally, a bottle of water and amenity kits were placed on my seat. The first service included a snack (mixed nuts), which I received about 25 minutes after take-off. During the flight, I requested a special seafood meal. The second service (entree) commenced approximately an hour after take-off, consisting of king prawns with vermicelli noodles and mixed veggies. A bread roll and butter were also served on the entree tray. A suggestion for improvement is for Garuda to use pure butter instead of canola spread. The third service (main course) was served around 2 hours after take-off, featuring a hot meal of rice with sweet & sour seafood mix and cap cay. A dessert, mango pudding, was also included on the main course tray. I strongly recommend serving the dessert separately from the main course, while placing the bread on the entree tray and the side dishes on the main course tray. This approach allows passengers to fully savor each dish, enhancing the overall dining experience on your flights. After finishing the main course, a crew member offered me tea/coffee while I enjoyed the dessert. I opted for a cup of tea, which came with a mini chocolate bar. Approximately 2-3 hours before landing, sweet and savory snacks were offered, along with a beverage service. An hour prior to landing, a pre-landing snack and a final beverage service were served. The snack consisted of a salmon & cucumber sandwich with seaweed-flavored chips. Another area for improvement is the amenity kits. The amenity kits included: - A dental kit with a toothbrush and toothpaste. - Earplugs and an eye mask for a good night's sleep. - Plush socks and a cozy, high-quality blanket. - A curated selection of magazines and a tablet loaded with the latest movies and TV shows. Amenity kits that were missing or should have been included: - High-end skincare products, including moisturizer, lip balm, and facial mist. - Dental floss. - A neck pillow that provides excellent support for relaxation. - A stylish pen and notebook for jotting down thoughts. - Noise-Canceling headphones for enjoying in-flight entertainment. - Tissues and wet wipes for convenience."

However in the flight from Jakarta to Amsterdam the screen and sound was not working of seat 35A. We switched headset to check if the headset was broken but all headsets gave no sound. So the screen and sound were broken. No movies or music could be watched or listened. We asked the stewardess and after a couple failed restart of the screen we asked if it was possible to change seat. Only one of us could change somewhere else or a person who was a sleep in de first 15 minutes of the flight should be asked to change so we could sit together but they did not want to wake her up. So no indication when she would wake up. After an hour we had to ask if she woke up because of the food round and they said she did not want to change. There was no wifi connection and we paid a lot for the flight and chairs to sit together. With a 13,5 hour flight and no service of a working screen or wifi for this kind of money should at least deserve something in return. We got home safe with baggage but it is not nice that you pay this much without entertainment service which should be included."

Boarding was orderly despite stumbling a bit on the jet bridge - and upon boarding the plane, I spotted several product issues: the cabin was clean but was kept at a high temperature during boarding, the windows and the right wing of the airplane were undermaintained for so long that I was barely able to see the window clearly and the paintings to peel off, and the headrest of my seat had shrunken to the point that I felt like I was leaning against a piece of metal. Adding insult to injury, the in-flight entertainment experienced a major downgrade - no more live TV shows, no more games, and my headphone jack was nearing its breaking point. The selections were excellent if this flight was taken in 2018, but they were severely outdated by 2022 standards. Its responsiveness was not any better. The aircraft took off late, and we queued for a very long time at the taxiway with a scorching hot temperature inside the cabin. At this point, I was already about to give this flight a 4/10 - but then, the crews and the meal saved the day, both adding 2 points each. The crews were extremely friendly, polite, and proactive. It all started when they escorted me from the seat, and even during disembarking, they were still in a happy and energetic mood. They apologized when they forgot my order. On this 3-hour flight, they also proved that they're still above anyone else by serving not one, but two meals. The first one was a grilled fish with rice and vegetables, while the second one was a piece of strawberry bread. We were also given two bottles of drinks - a bottle of water and a bottle of tea, with other options still available upon request. Overall, this flight was salvaged by the service aspects of the flight. Had the services been as bad as the product, I wouldn't have given this flight an 8/10. Garuda really should consider balancing its service and its product. I know that they're experiencing a hard time nowadays, but who knows that the act of balancing service and product can save Garuda. This flight was a true representation of the following statement: ""A+ grade service with a B- grade product""."

They had emailed about a cancelation, but the email header I missed. I did appreciate the phone call 2 days before to say was I aware my flight was cancelled and my flight had been moved in a week. They claimed they tried calling a week before, but i never got. Why not text, email again, Whatsapp like every other airline?  Then, Garuda stops all flights Perth to Jakarta from July 1st. With no other flights, I am forced to book with another airline. The customer service over the phone cannot process me a refund or travel voucher. So I am forced to email. Email communication is slow for replies, they do not give you correct information. For instance, I am told travel voucher is only option, then I am told I can get refund but the fee to process is 120AUD. I then say I will take travel voucher. This has been 48 hours later and it still not processed. Every email they just say ""Related to your refund request, we regret to inform your refund in form travel voucher is still in progress by our internal unit. Currently we are still waiting for confirmation and we will get back to you as soon as possible."" I know every other airline has been hard due to the pandemic, but other airlines I have dealt with have done things over the phone, and instantly."

Check in at GA flight business class always done at its class, a dedicated check in lounge. One concern on flight GA088 to AMS was, there were a few passengers moving around the cabin without having a mask on. What I found worse was when the cabin crews walked past those passengers and did not notice and did not give any warning. Once I thought perhaps those passengers just forgot to have their mask on, but no. Afterwards, I went to the in-charge crews in business class with an angry voice, to address my concern as to why they let such things happen in corona times. Although all GA cabin crews are vaccinated against Covid-19, they must have been more alert with the onboard situation like on any other airlines I have flown with. It makes me wonder, is it the lack of English of the crews or just an ignorance? I have written a few good reviews about GA flights, but not this time. They announced that all passengers must sit according to seat number on the boarding pass, but this is yet another issue. I had to sit in one seat far away from my travel companion because of the social distancing, but when one asked to move seat to the empty seat between us, it was allowed by the crew. IFE on GA flights are still below average, kindly do an upgrade. A pillow on board would have helped my quality of sleep."

Second time flying their B777 route AMS-CGK and vise versa. Flying during pandemic doesn't stop the cabin crew to provide their best service as always. Helpful, sincere, friendly and attentive, this is how I describe GA cabin crew. Meals served as always, course by course as if you are experiencing an A'la Carte dining. Unlike other airlines that decided to serve their meals in a box and cut services from usual, but not in GA. Covid-19 measurement is nicely done, all crews wearing mask and hand gloves. There is no unnecessary attributes. Business class lavatories are huge in comparison with KLM's I flew weeks ago. Seats comes in 1-2-1 configurations while many airlines are still on 2-2-2 or even 2-3-2. Social distance is well practiced on board which is the most important case nowadays. Same goes to some of their domestic route such as CGK-DPS will fly only wide body aircrafts to ensure the social distancing. Can't wait to experience this route in a few days after 5 days compulsory quarantine in Jakarta for all international arrivals to Indonesia."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denpasar Bali to Bandung,January 2021,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,4,yes,9,"  Denpasar Bali to Bandung on 10 January 2021 as part of family trip to SE Asia. A new government requirement of a 2x24 hours validity Rapid Antigen test or 3x24 hours validity PCR test before flying forced us to get a RA test the day before. We have to validate the test results prior to check in and shows the validated documents at Garuda check in desk. We shopped a lot in Bali so we were overweight more than the allowance (44 lbs/20 kg per person) and have to pay for excess baggage at another booth, but then all our luggage were tagged as priority due to the excess baggage payment. The aircraft for this trip is a 10 year old B738 (PK-GFA) that is still in good shape. Boarding was done a few minutes early than expected, with Business Class passengers boarding first and then all Economy passengers. The airplane was clean but we still use our Clorox wipes to clean the tray table, armrest, seatbelts and screen when we got to our seat. The seats are spacious, legroom more than enough and the entertainment screen and its content is very decent for this 1.5 hours flight. We used the provided 2-prong headphones, since our wireless transmitter that connects to bluetooth headset is using a single 3.5"" jack. We were given a snack box with pastries and granola bar for this short flight, and drinks from the drink cart. Just like the Garuda flight a few days before, the FAs in this flight were very courteous, polite, helpful and cheerful when attending to their passengers. GA still have the best FA compared to other airlines in the world! Our flight left a few minutes ahead of schedule and we arrived around 32 minutes ahead of schedule. Our luggage, having the priority tags, were among the first ones being unloaded from the aircraft to the Business Class luggage arrival area, ahead of the other luggage that have to go to the regular conveyor belt. Great job by Garuda ground handling! Garuda Indonesia has kept their service level consistently high, and I can see why they are one of the few airlines that have 5 stars rating. Even for a short flight in Economy we were given a great service and one can wonder how would it be for Garuda's long haul flights. Hope Garuda can fly to more overseas destinations, and hopefully to US, so we can use GA for overseas trips and enjoy their high level of service."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Jakarta to Denpasar Bali,January 2021,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,3.0,4,yes,9,"  Jakarta to Denpasar BaliS on 06 January 2021 as part of Family trip to SE Asia. Bali requires a valid PCR Test to enter and we were told to validate our papers at a validation desk at the airport before we can even check-in. Check in was done really quick. We waited at a gate area where there were 3 other airplanes were parked so it was quite crowded and only after other flights took off we were able to get some seats close to the gate. The boarding was done old style, Business class first then Economy all at the same time. However they did not announce to prepare the PCR Test to show at the gate, so after we showed them our passports I have to fish for the PCR Test papers from my rolling bag for the gate agent when we were already at the gate and she asked for it. Or perhaps she just did it randomly because we're not locals, I don't know. The airplane is a 9 year old B738 (PK-GFS) that is still in good condition and clean, however we still sanitize the tray table, seatbelts, screen and armrest with Clorox wipes. The seats are large with ample legroom, and the touch screen even though smaller but still very bright and watchable. They do not have a large selection of movies and music available but more than enough for this short 1.5 hours flight. They still use the two-prong jack so we cannot use our wireless transmitter (3.5"" jack) and bluetooth headphones, but have to use the provided free headphones. The FAs were very courteous and polite, they are super friendly and helpful, and also cheerful in their disposition when interacting with passengers. No wonder GA FA's won awards years in a row for being the best FA in the world! Even for this short flight we got a snack box with savory pastry, cake and a granola bar, and a bottle of water. The FA's also offer drink service along with the snack box. They apologized that due to Covid-19 they can no longer offer hot meal but only snack box in this (short) flight. Very good engagement, again, makes me realize why they were the best FAs! We left 27 minutes behind schedule due to some late passengers, but were able to arrive 12:26 PM local time, 14 minutes early from our scheduled arrival. Even in this short flight the service is great, and the spacious seats and (even though rather limited) entertainment makes flying Garuda Indonesia a great experience. Other airlines especially in US should learn a lot from Garuda on how to make a flight that is enjoyed and not dreaded by their passengers."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denpasar to Auckland via Australia,December 2020,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I booked Garuda to fly back from Bali - Auckland for Dec 2, and a week before departure they changed one flight of the four flights required to return, by a week. Meaning, we got to Melbourne, then had to stay there for a week (which was impossible due to Covid restrictions), but then our flights to NZ were still scheduled to leave the week before. We had no choice but to cancel the flights because it was completely impossible to return! Then, when we cancelled and used an alternative provider, they offered us a 'Travel Credit', which a) we have no intention to use in the next 12 months as travelling is virtually impossible at this stage, and b) we want to refund because we won't be able to use it. They then, would not provide a refund at all, and all my efforts to contact them to resolve this have landed on deaf ears - they completely ignore me! As you can see, I am very frustrated at this ridiculous service. They will change your flights, make it impossible, then when you have to cancel with them because it becomes impossible to travel, they will issue you a 'travel credit', rather than give your money back.

I called the Call Center regarding the refund policy and they said that it is possible to get a cash refund. So, I decided to ask for a refund the next day. I went to the Ticket Office to be told that my tickets cannot be refunded for cash, and the cancellation also incurs penalties. At first, they told me that cancellation will incur only 2 million IDR, but in fact, I still got charged with tax. In exchange, they offered me a voucher that is exclusive to this airline. The voucher requires me to travel back and forth only to redeem it before use, and the one-year expiry date is a let down."

Their service in-flight is very friendly and good. Checking in at AMS was a tiny bit of a hassle, due to the fact that they let this be handled by Swissport - they just changed this, so we didn't know beforehand. Checking in at DPS however was fine. Due to COVID-19 we needed to go back to NL a week early. Garuda offered special treatment as rebooking could be done at no additional cost (!!) which is very generous from them I think (in comparison, KLM, our national carrier in NL stopped flying at all!). I chat with the Garuda team online at saturday morning about our situation, and, believe it or not, that same evening we could fly back to AMS at 19:05! How's that for service? Checking in at DPS was very friendly and helpful. They arranged the new boarding passes for us so we could get back to NL safe and sound. Arriving in AMS we unfortunately found out that our baggage didn't come with us. In these rare conditions, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, a lot of people took extra baggage with them and Garuda was forced to leave a lot of it behind. I heard from multiple other people they had the same issue, but the baggage arrives fine a few days later. At this time of writing we don't have it back, but it has been just one day, and we should get it in about 3 days - so we don't worry too much about this. All in all, flying with this Asian airline the first time, was very pleasant. Seats of the flight (777-300ER 3U3) were quite large and spacious, but we are just shorties (1.7m) so no leg problems here. As we had a free seat next to us on both flights, we had plenty of space. The in-flight services (beverages and drinks) were also fine. We had chicken, rice and some veggies and another time we had salmon, rice and veggies. In between we got some bread and other small snacks. It was so unfortunate for the stewardesses to need to wear masks, as they all looked so friendly. In-flight connectivity was superb, compared to (for example) United, the Wi-Fi speed was so fast that you could even stream movies from Netflix or Prime most of the flight! Also, the pricing for Wi-Fi was acceptable at around 20 euros for 24 hours. As a conclusion I can really recommend flying with Garuda when you're flying from AMS to DPS (or the other way around). They offer very good service, bigger seats and most important, customer comes in front of money-making. Where our national carrier KLM just stopped flying at all, Garuda keeps flying for at least another week to get passengers back home in these difficult crisis times."

On board, the crew welcomed us warmly, engaged with my son and consistently demonstrated helpfulness and friendliness despite the flight being full both in Business and Economy Class. The snack served in Economy Class was two breads, a pack of nuts and a bottle of mineral water. Garuda has added to capacity in some of its Economy Class planes, making the seat pitch and leg room less narrower and for me personally less comfortable. The flight could also have been more enjoyable if Garuda added more movie selection in its in-flight entertainment system. The flight departed and landed on time. We appreciated Garuda for bringing us back to Jakarta safely."

Disappointed by Garuda Indonesia on this specific service, especially when compared to their other A330 flights from Denpasar or Jakarta to Australian destinations. The aircraft is older than most other A330 services (built in 1998) and its interior appears to have stayed the same, with no inflight entertainment screens, comparably tiny overhead baggage bins, seat pitch of around 31 inches in an all economy layout. It seems like GA operates most of its oldest aircraft in all economy configurations on flights from Indonesia to Beijing, due to the comparatively high percentage of tourists who are very sensitive to price. However, at a similar price to other both Chinese airlines and international ones offering a connection, it's definitely a hard one for GA to stand out from the crowd, even if at a comparatively lower price. However, on the good side, the fantastic cabin crew service as well as its food is still shown on this flight."

Overall a very pleasant experience and lives up to its 5 star rating and best cabin crew awards.  Legroom is amazing. It appears to be at least 34 inches, and coming from other airlines offering 31 inch legrooms on international flights this is immediately apparent. In fact, it is so roomy when you need to get out of your seat your seat mate won't even need to get out of his/her chair, only needing to tuck their legs a bit back and you are out. Food provided was very pleasant, with metal cutlery provided in addition to multiple frequent drink services. On this specific route, I would definitely recommend Garuda Indonesia over other airlines simply because of the experience you get from them."

The check in process was adequate, however it was more like a transaction rather than a check in as the person checking m in seemed bored. I note that Garuda use agents in Amsterdam rather than their own team. Garuda uses the KLM lounge in Amsterdam which is quit large, however it is mainly full from early morning until midday, therefore very difficult to find a seat. Therefore I went straight to the gate and waiting for boarding. We boarded on time, however the aircraft pulled back a little behind schedule, but that did not delay our arrival in Medan. Onboard the cabin crew started serving drinks as soon as we sat down and also took note of what I wanted after take off. The menu selection of food and drinks was quite good and the crew keep coming around offering snacks and drinks after main meal was served. The main meal which I chose was the COD and it tasted very good and was well presented. After arrival in Medan I was assisted through immigration and baggage collection. After clearing customs my baggage was taken by the ground staff for forwarding to the Jakarta flight. The Medan-Jakarta sector again was good as their was a selection of Asian and western food available for breakfast. Again the service onboard was very good. With the exception of the check in experience and lack of seating in the KLM Lounge in Amsterdam, overall it was an excellent flight with outstanding onboard service."

I was initially excited to be travelling with Garuda on the new A330 neo. However that excitement soon faded and the worst business class flight I have ever taken. First of all the crew weren’t ready when we boarded, no alcoholic drinks were offered pre take off. It took them 3 hours to serve lunch. The starter was a prawn and the main course of beef was as tough as an old boot. Service continued to be incredibly slow throughout the flight. The thing that got my blood boiling was when a member of crew asked whether an ill member of crew could sit next to me? I said no because I didn’t want to catch what they had. To my amazement this was ignored and when I returned from the toilet the said crew member was asleep  next to me! I will never fly with them again."

When we booked it was direct with 1x2x1 seating but they made us stop and put us in 2x2x2 so wasn't a great start.

There is a big difference with Garuda depending on the configuration of the aircraft. Unfortunately this flight was the old configuration and was not a true lie flat bed. The IFE on Garuda is never great but this was as poor. Garuda also seem to struggle in Business Class when the flight is full. I have to say that the service on this flight could have been much better. On boarding there was no introduction by the FA, we then had to wait for an hour to get a glass of wine off the crew and this was not replenished without asking. As it was a late flight there was not dinner service and the breakfast. was tasty but service was haphazard. Overall not the best experience in Business Class."

Our flight home on Sunday 5th January was terrible. The meal was one of the worst we have had I asked for a glass of red wine for my self and white wine for my wife. The wine was given to us in paper cups. Later we asked for a coke and a sprite, again served in a paper cup. The cans were warm and no ice was offered. The seats were uncomfortable.  We flew with Garuda the same time back in 2018 and there were no problems then. We fly to Bali the same time every year and have flown with low cost airlines (Airasia, Malindo Air and Batik ) and received better service. We will never fly with Garuda again."

The airline used quite old aircraft, 23 years old, as a result it cannot give enough comfort. The cabin interior looked not very fresh and some elements definitely needed to be repaired. For example, there was a hole between an upper panel and a wall, it vibrated during the flight. I was really surprised there was no onboard entertainment system and no USB-socket. Seat pitch was very small and felt like a low-cost airline. My food was very poor and they didn't serve any wine to me. "

I was escorted from the check-in through to the lounge by the Ms Rosma the Garuda ground support manager and one of her team. When time came for boarding I greeted at the aircraft door with a warm welcome and a smile. We pulled back from the gate a little ahead of schedule, however we had a long taxi ride to the runway. Shortly after take-off the main meal was served. The choice was two Asian rice dishes only with a choice of soft or warm drinks. I opted for a only bread roll. More hot & cold drinks and snacks were served throughout the 3.40 hour flight. 30 minutes prior to landing in Sorong a bread roll was offered together with hot or cold drinks. Throughout the flight the toilets were cleaned and the cabin crew were very attentive through the flight. There were only two cabin crew in the business class section, which was full, however they provided a very good level of service and they were very polite and courteous. We landed in Sorong on schedule, however I had to wait nearly 45 minutes for my baggage."

With his help we were checked in very quickly and then escorted through security, immigration and into the lounge. The lounge used by Garuda at Haneda is also used by other airlines, therefore was very busy, however we were able to find a place for us to sit together. The food and drinks available in the lounge was adequate. When time came for boarding the Garuda ground support team were on hand to escort us to the plane. At the plane we were greeted at the door by the cabin crew who provided us with a very warm welcome. They certainly know how to treat their passengers and make you feel very welcome. There was a very good selection of food and drinks available and the quality, presentation and taste was excellent. Although the Cabin was full the Cabin crew kept coming around and offering warm and cold drinks together with snacks. They even went out of their way to help and assist my two children with additional snacks through out the flight. Additionally on the flight Garuda provides free onboard Wi Fi for the total duration of the flight and the speed of connection was quite impressive. Upon arrival in Jakarta we were met at the plane door by the Garuda ground service team who helped me and my family through immigration, baggage collection and directly to the cars provided by Garuda to take us to our accommodation. Another outstanding service from Garuda Cabin Crew and Ground support teams."

I used Bid Upgrade to get the business seat in this flight and perhaps that was the reason I felt ignored unlike few previous experience with Garuda when we purchased the business class tickets outright. All the ground experience was fine. On boarding the FA came around offering drinks and taking notes on what the breakfast choice to be. Then I went off sleeping until I heard sounds of plates and cutlery as sign of they were starting serving breakfast. I was not served my breakfast even though I turned my seat upright, FAs just walked pass me back and forth. At first, I thought I should just wait maybe mine will come soon - it did not until we landed. No one asked if I'd like anything to drink, I had to ring the bell to ask for a cup of coffee and it was too late to ask for breakfast then. Once we landed, the FA who took my order came to me and said I was sleeping soundly that she did not want to wake me up hence I skipped breakfast. The fact that I sat there the entire time they served breakfast and kept asking my neighbor passengers what else they'd like felt like an insult to me. Would I fly with Garuda again? Yes, if we are flying to Indonesia, but never use the Big Upgrade anymore. It's such a shame that I have always recommended them before as we have always received great hospitality prior. Hopefully it was just a one-off occasion and not a new trend for Garuda."

Check in was very quick and we were then assisted through immigration and into the lounge. When time came for boarding the Ground support team were on hand to help and assist us. The ground service team were so helpful all the way from following up with pick up driver, check in support, assistance through immigration and boarding the flight. The service was exceptional, therefore I would like to thank Rebecca and her team who are really dedicated to ensuring that their passengers are well looked after. As it was over night flight we all went to sleep, however prior to bedding down the cabin crew came around and took our meal section for breakfast. They started serving breakfast approx. 1.5 hours prior to landing. The selection of food was excellent and was very well presented. My young daughter woke up late, however the on board chef prepared some hot food to take away as we had a connecting flight and she could eat in the lounge. We landed in Haneda on schedule and we were met by the Haneda Garuda ground support team who helped and assisted us through immigration and check in for our onward flight.

The cabin crew looked very jaded and unmotivated, I can tolerate a bit of that as the flight was in the late evening. The announcement was done by a pre-recorded message which in my opinion loses a bit of human touch experience. The food was okay. Nothing special, in fact it's pretty mediocre.

Economy has a 2x4x2 seat configuration. The cabin provided everything you'd expect from a new plane, new IFE with a 10"" screen, but the same limited content as on the older A330-200. Disappointing as Garuda should provide a broader choice as well as live TV. Free Wifi connection didn't work for me as I don't use WhatsApp, but other passengers seemed to be using it. Other apps didn't work at all. The flight was delayed for an hour due to bad weather in Bali and they didn't catch up the time lost before landing in Amsterdam, which was fine with me personally, but others might consider this disappointing. The plane was only half full, which meant that I had 2 seats for myself. Leg room was great, and seat good. Sadly they did not offer beer or wine on the DPS-KNO flight, only KNO-AMS. But drinks were offered in abundance, food was average. Best part of course was the awesome crew. Great price and overall offering, unbeatable in my opinion for this route. Very pleasant experience and will fly Garuda again."

Although the plane was relatively old, it didn't seem that way except for the quite small 9"" screens and the out-dated IFE. Garuda should really update this as the on demand choice is small and the software kind of slow. Excellent check in service. Very charming, polite and courteous crew. I just can't find any mistake in their passenger handling.  Legroom was good, plane was only half full. The cabin service including drinks, was fine as they kept coming and offered new drinks. Food was average in my opinion, snack choice available but limited. Previously you had to change planes in Jakarta to fly to Bali, now they offer a connection via Medan. In Medan the plane got refueled, cleaned a bit and half of the passengers left here, while passengers to Denpasar had to stay on the plane. They promise a 30mins layover, but ours was more like 90 mins, which wasn't really a problem as it makes the whole flight still shorter than via Jakarta before.

Garuda Indonesia as always excel in their service, most notably their flight attendants who are helpful, friendly, and really smooth your journey. They are not pushy, but they are really helpful and their smile is genuine. The seats are pretty comfy and the leg space is very good. In-flight entertainment is pretty dated as the movies are pretty old, but they have quite good movie selection. Food in-flight needs some work as the menu is not very good. Water and other beverage is very good, on the other hand. The flight is smooth and good, and the pilot informs well before any turbulence so you won't be shocked in your seat.

We found the seat width to be inadequate especially when myself and other two passengers have broad shoulders. Very tight squeeze for the 3.hrs 25 mins to DPS. On return flight, air conditioning was not working so not only was it a tight squeeze home but very uncomfortable with the heat, many people complaining but nothing was done. Drinks and food was served with delay adding to the frustration that the cabin getting warmer, people getting hot. Ok food selection for flight out of PER but disappointing on the return leg. Options were chicken or fish, by the time it reached row 19 the chicken had been depleted, the air hostess saying they only stock 20% chicken and the rest fish. I expect more comfortable seating and better service to match what they claim to be a 5-star airline. Please consider going with another airline as Garuda has dropped their game!"

They really are an excellent airline; even the economy seats have good legroom and pitch and the IFE is adequate although there are some very outdated movies and a small selection of various TV shows. However, for a short flight such as Melbourne to Denpasar, one movie would usually suffice. Everything has been thought of, blankets, sleep masks etc and the FAs move effortlessly around the aircraft with drinks and snacks regularly and the main meals are hot and tasty; usually consisting of chicken or fish. The only criticism I would have would be is that there are several long winded flight deck announcements made in Indonesian but very brief annoucments made in English so you don't really get much information which I found a little odd, especially returning to Melbourne when the plane was 99% full of English speakers. I do respect the fact it is an Indonesian owned plane but that needs to be reviewed. Overall, definitely fly Garuda again."

Very crowded buses between terminal and plane. On the flight to Bali a larger jet was used, seating far better, bottled water offered on boarding etc. Meals are very average.

Return journey I went to check in at DPS and airport security said my Macbook Pro has a battery recall which they need to make Garuda aware of. Garuda checkin staff had absolutely no idea about this recall or how to act. They spent an hour discussing it amongst themselves and making phone calls to people who never seemed to answer the phone for us then to be told checkin had closed and we'd missed the flight. I told them that this was their fault and they had to find a solution to get us to Shanghai that day. Checkin then  re-opened but I was told they would not give me my Macbook back. So I was in the position of losing the computer or business class tickets. Decided to leave the computer, given no official form or statement to say that Garuda had taken it and was given no information on how to claim it back. What makes less sense is I had travelled to Bali on Garuda during this recall two weeks earlier band they had not brought it up during that trip. This was by far the worst experience of any airline."

I complained to Garuda Perth Office and the reply from the State Manager was more or less bad luck and refused a refund for the extra we paid. Garuda Perth to Bali is 100% a budget airline, the food was poor and on the return flight we brought our own food and ate at the departure gate so we did not need to eat on the flight. The flight entertainment  was a joke. No spirits served on board and lucky if you can get a beer or water. Garuda have lost me completely now, will take my business elsewhere."
✅ Trip Verified ,Airbu,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Sydney via Denpasar,September 2019,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,3.0,2,no,2,"  The flight was to be direct London to Denpasar on a Boeing 777-200 and connecting on to Sydney in an Airbus. The  flight from London to Denpasar was changed without being notified the Boeing 777 being changed to an older and less comfortable A330, an additional stop in Medan Indonesia, to refuel but with about half passengers getting off. On arriving in Denpasar we were rushed to our connecting Garuda aircraft and there was no way our luggage could have come with us (arriving 24 hours later in Sydney). The business class service was so poor, they woke business class passengers 3 hours before landing in Medan to ask if breakfast was wanted. Denpasar-Sydney flight there wasn't a printed menu but rather a small handwritten note that the cabin crew were using."

Check in was seamless as was security as there was not many people around late evening when I was checking in. The Garuda lounge was also quite as it was late evening, however the staff in the lounge were very helpful as they brought me out a selection of sandwiches which was very much appreciated. Boarding started at approx. 12:00am at gate 16 for our departure at 12:30am and boarding process was completed quickly as we left the gate on schedule. As it was night flight I tried to get some sleep, however the seats are not that comfortable as they are in need of repair. The service from the cabin crew was excellent as they keep coming around offering snacks and soft drinks through out the flight, even though the cabin was full. We arrived in Sorong on schedule and baggage came out very quickly, overall a good flight, however Garuda needs to fix seats as they are in much need of repair as they are beginning to show their age."

Long time no fly with Garuda Indonesia,  surprised by a few changes. Now, snacks are no longer packaged in boxes but use recycled paper, for me this is an innovative way to make efficiency and show that Garuda Indonesia is an environmentally friendly airline.  For the short route from Palembang to Jakarta, they no longer offer additional beverage services such as coke, water, milk or juice. My flight was delayed for 2 hours because of the haze that blanketed the island of Sumatra. I still recommend Garuda Indonesia as the airline of choice if you want a comfortable seat and entertainment that is quite up to date, on the other hand I must say that Garuda Indonesia must restore their best performance immediately."

Jakarta-Amsterdam part was flown with Garuda in partnership with KLM which took the Amsterdam-Tel Aviv part. I found Garuda to be one of the best airlines I have flown with so far. Service on the ground and in the air were outstanding! Kosher food, IFE and the seat were all positive. What I like most is the friendliness of the cabin crew, they treat you like a king! Will definitely fly Garuda again for my future trips to Indonesia."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300 ER,Business,First Class,Tokyo Haneda to Jakarta,September 2019,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Flew from Tokyo Haneda to Jakarta on GA875 on September 18th. Check in opened 3 hours prior to departure and the overall check in process was very efficient and I was on my way to the lounge via immigration. The check in and immigration process took less that 5 minutes to complete. I was escorted through to the lounge by a Garuda ground support staff member. The lounge is a shared lounge, however it is functional and has all the amenities that anyone requires in a lounge. When it was time to board the Garuda ground support staff came and escorted me to the aircraft, which was only a short walk from the lounge. The Garuda cabin crew welcome when boarding is great as you know you are with a team that is really happy to have you onboard. I noticed that Garuda now have a new safety briefing video, which I think is great as it shows the safety briefing intertwined with the various regions and cultures through out Indonesia. I was offered to pre-book my meal prior to boarding, however I stuck with the onboard menu which was more that sufficient. The food selection taste and presentation was excellent. Garuda also provides free onboard Wi-Fi and the connectivity all the way from Haneda to Jakarta was great. Arrival in Jakarta was slightly ahead of schedule and when the plane door was opened I was met by the Jakarta based ground support team who really go out of their way to make to feel special. I was escorted through immigration and only had to wait a few minutes for my luggage to come out. The ground support team then escorted me to a car, which Garuda provided to take me to my home. Overall it was a excellent flight with the door to door service."

When I arrived in Denpasar again Garuda ground support team were on hand to assist me took me to the international terminal including clearing immigration for my flight to Tokyo. The overnight flight to Tokyo took off on time and I was able to get a full 5 hours sleep. Food onboard was excellent as was the service. Upon arrival in Narita I again was assisted by the Garuda ground support team who helped me through immigration and customs and transportation to my hotel. I would like to thank Garuda Indonesia for this outstanding service and how seamless they made my flight even though I went through 3 airports."

Check-in at Heathrow shambolic not given the eat I had reserved. Fastrack security then the Sky Team Lounge with the most unfriendly service ever, food terrible. Boarding was delayed, on board staff amazing, very attentive. Snacks and drinks offered between meals. Food service was very good, nice crockery & tableware. Food was great quality & tasty. Inflight entertainment selection poor for such a long flight of over 17 hrs. Washrooms the cleanest I've experienced on an aircraft. The staff were genuine and appeared to be enjoying their work. Although not the same level of seat as some of the Arab airlines the service was far superior. I would fly Garuda business again."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Jakarta to Singapore,September 2019,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  From boarding to getting off, just fantastic! Our flight from Singapore to Jakarta with Garuda Indonesia was surprisingly good. Friendly ground crews take care of the needs of passengers and help where they can. There was no delay on our flight. The cabin was clean and in very a good condition. Although the brown seats take some getting used to, but they are comfortable. The legroom is really positive remarkable. It looks a bit in the cabin as if the time has stopped, because the style is really strange. It is interesting that all passengers on a flight with this airline get a hot meal if the flight time is longer than 90 minutes. Drinks are free on board. There are local drinks and food. The staff is also happy to help you fill out the immigration forms, if requested. A single point of criticism is that the windows of the Boeing 737 may be better cleaned from the outside. I already noticed that on several flights. Garuda Indonesia fly again? Always again! This is service competence and friendliness at its best!"

Check in was fast and efficient, however going through security took time as only a single lane was open. I did not have much time as I arrived from a connecting flight, therefore I did not visit the local Lounge. The cabin crew as normal on Garuda gave a warm welcome with genuine smiles. There was 3 selections of food available onboard and this was more than the Jakarta to Sorong flight 10 days earlier, however what was offered tasted good. Arrival in Jakarta was slightly ahead of schedule and baggage came out very quickly so I was on my way home very quickly. Overall this flight was much better that my GA862 August 30th Jakarta to Sorong flight."

I was disappointed flying home from Bali as the website stated flying business class I was allowed 40 kilos in one suitcase when I arrived at check-in I was advised the limit was 32 kilos in one suitcase so I had to repackage my bag at the airport. On returning I spoke with my travel agent and they had no idea about that rule. The service on board was amazing it was just disappointing about my check-in experience

Check in was straight forward and going through security was fast. The domestic Lounge in Jakarta Terminal-3 is large, but it lacks food, snacks and drinks. The snacks and food that were available was very limited, which meant I had to go outside to buy food. Boarding the flight was orderly and the plane pulled away from the gate on time, however we had a long taxi to the runway. Again the food and drinks available onboard was very limited and this seems to be a growing trend on Garuda domestic flights. The Cabin Crew did their best in providing what they had available and were extremely friendly. Arrival at Sorong was only slightly behind schedule and baggage came out very quickly. The flight itself was good, however the lack of snacks and drinks even soft drinks is a big switch off both in the lounge and onboard. Garuda needs to do better if they want to maintain their 5 Star rating."

Booked 2 x extra legroom economy class flights to and from Bali. Our flight times, outbound and inbound - were changed multiple times, culminating in Garuda cancelling our return flight altogether. When challenged, the airline did rebook our return flights but sold our extra legroom seats again. The airline could not disappoint the customer assigned our booked seats but they were quite happy to disappoint us. This is unacceptable and appalling customer service. We asked about the cost of an upgrade to business class and Garuda were not willing to offer a discounted rate. The cost was in excess of £3000GBP per person. We are now about to board an 18hr flight to the UK in seats that we didn’t book. We have flown to South East Asia a number of times but we will never use Garuda again. We’ll use Malaysia, Thai, Emirates, etc., who offer much better customer focused service."

Explained my interest in changing flight date. Person put me on hold and there was only empty noise for five minutes or so. No indication of any kind if my call was ever going to get answered so I hung up. Using Skype, I later rang the two numbers on the website.

Check in was fast and efficient. The lounge now used by Garuda is the Marhaba lounge, which is good as they have a good selection of food, snacks and drinks and lots of space for working. The plane was parked remotely so we had to use a bus to the plane, however this was fast and hassle free. The flight took off a few minutes ahead of scheduled and we landed in Jakarta 5 minutes ahead of schedule.

The Check in process at Jakarta Terminal-3 was a pleasant experience and the check in team were most helpful. We were met upon arrival in Medan and were escorted through immigration and into the lounge by the Garuda ground support team. They also escorted us to the London bound aircraft when we were ready to board. The onboard welcome by the cabin crew was 100% genuine and they really look me and my family through out the flight. The food onboard was excellent and there was a good selection of meals to chose from. The Chef and the cabin crew kept coming around offering snacks and drinks after the main meal. The seats were comfortable and we were able to get several hours of sleep even though it is a day flight. The aircraft arrived in London a little a head of schedule and with the help of the Garuda ground support team in London we were through immigration, collected our luggage and cleared customs all within 30 minutes and were on our way to our accommodation.

The Airplane was not the newest (considering it's an 737 you might not want the newest anyway, which luckily are still being grounded world-wide). Legroom was decent for the short haul flight, IFE working nicely with reasonable choices of content, the provided headphones were also quite comfortable and sounded reasonably ok (unlike some cheapo earphones given away by other airlines). Despite the short flying time of 1.5h between Singapore and Jakarta, Garuda provides a full meal service, with two choices to choose from, to my delight. On the way back it even offered the choice of a special dish from Padang, which was created by one of the famous Padang Restaurants in Indonesia. This was quite the highlight. The not-so-good: Windows were dusty somehow (but rest of the cabin were actually quite reasonably clean). And the fact that Garuda lands in Jakarta in Terminal 3 Airport (the older Terminal 2 would be better) - but that is more material for the Airport review."

In May I purchased a direct flight from Denpasar to XI'an for August 5th directly through Garuda's website. Today (July 24), I got an email from Garuda with a table that showed the date of the ticket I booked (the 'old ticket') and the date of my 'new ticket' August 2 - three days different. Nothing else was written in this email, no acknowledgement, no explanation. I called Garuda and talked to three different 'customer service' employees and had nothing resolved, because as each employee admitted they can't do anything. I asked to speak to a manager and was told no one else was working. I was told to go to the airport office.  I asked if I would be reimbursed for a car and was told no. I was told I will have to take a code share flight on another airline that is a connecting flight. I paid for a direct flight because I am moving and have luggage. They will not make up the cost difference. They just told me I can cancel my flight and book with another airline. "

But now they only serve snacks inside a bag. No candies offered before take off. But the flight attendant still try to serve the passengers in a professional way. The plane is a B 737-800 NG, but the IFE is getting old fashioned on this 1hr 40 mins flight. Luckily I got hot seat next behind the business class that gives me a huge legroom. With the high price in their domestic routes, I hope Garuda can give more services to their customers. The ground service is so so... the terminal is still the best, but will request you to walk further than in the old terminal."

While the flight was not bad (wide seats, good pitch), I am a bit disappointed. I had high expectations, which were not met - at boarding a random cabin bag search took place. Staff was unable to explain why a lighter was not allowed on-board whilst being allowed in the same flight from Heathrow. Staff on-board was medium friendly, and did not seem to understand English very well. IFE was outdated and very limited movies: only about 24 movies, old, and from a limited number of genres. After the whole flight being served only water and juice, I asked for  wine during dinner. Staff mentioned there was no wine or spirits available, which I find  hard to believe in a flight with 20% occupancy. Unclear why frequent flyers don’t get upgraded to Business Class. In summary, the flight was not bad, but I don’t Think there was much difference compared to 4 star airline."

The aircraft for the flight was a B777 with a 3-3-3 layout in economy. A blanket and small pillow are available on the seat right when you board. The seats itself are comfortable and the legroom quite spacious for economy. The load for the flight was around 60-70%. Particularly in the very rear cabin there were many empty rows so it's possible to get a row for yourself and lie down. Flight attendants on this flight were attentive and very friendly. The food served was good although not spectacular and it's nice that you can freely go to the galley and grab some chips and other snacks to snack on while you watch films on this long haul day flight. Regarding the IFE, there could really be an upgrade in film choices. There is certainly enough to keep you occupied and enough of an option for everyone but more choices would be an upgrade. Once at Heathrow I found my luggage already at the belt even though it did not take me long at all going through immigration. All in all it was a very positive experience with Garuda."

The boarding gate 24 is located a long way from the lounge area, however there are buggies that are available for anyone to board and they will drop you off at the gate. The boarding process was straight forward as there were two gates one for Business Class and Sky Priority members and the other for Economy. The flight took off a little behind schedule as there was queue for take off ahead of us. The flight itself was ok considering it is a night flight. The cabin crew came around through out the flight offering snacks and drinks, it would have been much better if they had of switched the cabin lights out and aloud us to sleep. The flight landed in Sorong close on schedule time, however it took much longer than usual for my baggage to be delivered for a business class passengers. The service overall from check in at Jakarta to landing in Sorong was good, but Garuda could do with a rethink about switching the cabin lights off after initial meal has been served as that would allow people to get some sleep."

As we were delayed leaving London this meant that I might miss my connecting flight to Jakarta, however on arrival in Denpasar, Bali Garuda had one of their ground staff meet me at the aircraft door and escort me all the way through immigration, customs and check in for the Jakarta flight. Without her help I think would not have been able to make the connection and I am very thankful to her and the Garuda team for their help.

Welcomed by the cabin crew with a warm smile and greetings, Candy and Newspaper were provided. So, unfortunately I sat in the middle because apparently the window seats are all full. The seats were comfortable and also you have extra legroom. They have inflight entertainment system and its decently nice although the screen isn't really responsive (you need to press a bit harder/ it might take time to load). There are good selection of movies and tv shows and also many more. I ended up watching some movies however, i noticed that i didn't have a headphone so i ask the flight attendants to bring me one. Snacks (ts only a 40 minute flight) they serve was quiet nice as well which consist of bun, cake, and brownie and also a towel) There's also many choices for the drink. After approximately 40 minutes flight, we finally arrived in yogyakarta. Overall a very good flight experience!"

The business lounge is not what I would describe as a business class lounge as it is used by general public for a fee. The flight departed Sorong on schedule and arrived in Jakarta on schedule. The On board service was ok, however there was only two selections of food being served and none of these were western. I find this hard to comprehend as over 85% of the business class passengers on the flight were westerners. The cabin crew tried to serve the best they could and did come around several times of snacks, however for the fares being charged for this sector I think Garuda Indonesia should be offering a much better service."

The flight is very standard as expected for a short-haul one. However, it is worthy to note that the airline actually served a cold snack for a flight that was less than an hour long. It took quite long for checked baggage to arrive at the carousel in Jakarta, possibly due to the sheer size of the new Terminal 3."

This was my first flight with Garuda, and I was totally impressed. Ground service was seamless. The seat was not anything special but comfortable (similar to that on Asiana and Vietnam Airlines A350). Cabin crew was attentive and genuinely nice. However, the highlight was the food. Meal presentations were meticulous in the way of first class service elsewhere, and the food tasted equally good. Dishes were served not on a tray, but separately plated; each was accompanied by new utensils to match, and that created a proper restaurant feel. In my opinion, food is the least important thing on a flight, but it is the same time the most recognizable measure of an airline's service quality. An airline that does well in meals often excels quality control."

The check in process was very fast as there were little people around at 21:00pm. Upon entering the lounge I noticed that Garuda has re-arranged the domestic lounge to provide more seating area. This is a very positive step and does give more seating area. The lounge itself was also very quiet due to the late evening. The gate for boarding the flight is a good 15 minute walk from the lounge, however not too bad as there was little people around. The gate check in process was ok given that the flight was full. I was lucky that I was in the emergency exist row as this give me extra leg room. The flight time is 3 hours and 45 minutes and an overnight flight.

Left at lunch time and had good lunch. At dinner time by my body clock, I was encouraged to eat hot snacks . However, I really wanted to have their dinner menu at that time but was told it would be served 2 hours before landing. Such are the arbitrary rules of air travel! That would have been in the early hours of the morning by my body clock and I would not want the dinner if full up with snacks. I would also have liked to get some sleep before landing. Fortunately, they did agree to serve my dinner a bit early and I did get a short nap before landing. There was an on-board chef. Wines were good, food was beautifully presented but the ingredients were not really up to the same standard. Overall, though, a very high standard."

The plane was full, however the cabin crew did come around quite often offering snacks and drinks, however there was no sugar free soft drinks available on board also. The food selection is also very limited i.e. only two options. The flight arrived in Sorong on time and baggage came out very quickly. Overall the flight was ok, however Garuda Indonesia needs to think about providing non sugar based soft drinks together with a wider selection of meals considering that it is a 3.35 hour flight and arrives in Sorong at approx. 06:30am. Therefore a breakfast might be appropriate."

I got told that the fee to reschedule my flight is A$100 + $13 price difference. I agreed to it and they said they are going to confirm the rescheduling and told me to wait for 3-5 mins. And the call always got disconnected. In the end, I'm still trying to sort out my rescheduling via live chat now. I don't know whether it's going to go well or not.

Garuda are now using the SKY PRIORITY Lounge in Terminal-4 and this is much better as there is loads of space and a very good selection of hot and cold food and drink. The boarding gate was vey close to the lounge and the boarding process was well controlled. As it was a night flight I was able to get between 5~6 hours sleep. The cabin crew when I awoke were on hand to offer food and drinks and nothing was any problem for them. The cabin crew are very friendly and are really happy to show you Indonesian hospitality at its best.

The IFE on Garuda could have better options, there was a very limited choice but what they offered was still pretty good.

Surprisingly the crew handed me a Fast track card since I was connecting on a domestic flight and would have to past immigration, I was shocked that the crew gave it.

In the lounge the ground support team were most helpful and brought my children some great snacks as we waited for our connecting flight to Jakarta. The flight to Jakarta was slightly delayed, however the ground support team did everything possible to keep us updated on the revised departure time. Upon arrival in Jakarta the Garuda ground support team were on hand to help and assist us getting our luggage and getting us on the road home. Overall a great service both on ground and in the air from Garuda Indonesia from Check-in at Narita, Tokyo to in Jakarta via Denpasar."

Garuda ground support team even called me prior to us leaving home to ask the approx. time that we would be arriving at the airport so that they would have someone waiting to help us with our luggage. Check-in all the way to Narita was very fast and efficient. The Lounge in Jakarta was busy was expected as Christmas holiday time, however they were seats available. On arrival in Denpasar Garuda ground support team were on hand to escort us from the domestic terminal to the international terminal and through immigration and they then took us to the lounge. The Garuda ground support teams, in Jakarta, Denpasar and Narita are a credit to Garuda Indonesia as they are dedicated to their passenger’s and nothing is any bother to them. Our flight from Denpasar to Narita flight was scheduled to take off at 12:20am and we boarded well in advance and will two young children this helped them get ready for some sleep. The cabin crew were outstanding to my family overall and went out of their way to help and accommodate my young children food needs even though I did not pre-book any special meals.

When I went to the business lounge I found that there was no NON sugar soft drinks and/or western food available so I had to go out to a local food outlet within the airport and purchase. The same on the aircraft there was no non sugar soft drinks nor was there sparking water. There was only two selections of food being served and none were western. I find this hard to comprehend as over 70% of the business class passengers were westerners. If Garuda do not serve western food on domestic flights and/or want to service non sugar drinks, then they should inform their passengers so that we can bring our own snacks. I can only assume that Garuda are trying to save money as on their international flights they have an excellent service and a very good selection of food and drinks."

Drinks were offered with choice of juices, water, tea or coffee and alcohol. Trays were cleared away quickly. Entertainment was fine with a good selection of movies, tv shows and music, on this 3 hour flight it was hard to do it justice. Crew answered call bells quickly and always with a genuine smile. On this short flight expectations were well met. The bonus of flying GA economy was the leg room I am 180cm tall and had plenty of leg room even with the seat in front reclined. We arrived early and had to circle Bali for a while before landing. Arrival formalities were fast baggage appeared in reasonable time.

For some reason Garuda do not service sugar free drinks on their domestic flights.

The First Class cabin was full; however, the cabin crew were able to cater to all in line with the usual Garuda Indonesia’s 5 Star service and nothing was able bother to the Cabin Crew. When we arrived in Jakarta I was met by the Garuda Ground Support Team and was taken through Immigration Fast Track and on to collect our luggage and on the waiting car. Great team of people both on the ground and in the air that Garuda Indonesia should be very proud of. The only sad part is that Garuda stop flying to London from October 28th, 2018.

On check-in at Denpasar I was asked if I could change my seat as a couple wanted to be seated together. I agreed as a good gesture as I was travelling alone. I was moved to 11c. I was shocked to discover Garuda asked me to change seats when there was 3 lots of 2 seats available so why was I asked to give up my booked seat when there were other seats available where they could have sat together. I will never agree to change my seat for any reason in the future.
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,Palembang to Brussels via Jakarta / Amsterdam,October 2018,1.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,3.0,2,no,5," I have taken several business flights with Garuda (two long haul - one in an A330 and one in a B777). The B777 business seat is the cocoon type. However, when flattened, the seat is too short to sleep flat out (I'm 1m90 / 6ft3), and it is too narrow to comfortably curl up. The seat cushion also has bumps and ridges across its surface (where the seat surfaces intersect). Other airlines provide top matresses to cover up this up (e.g. ANA, NZA). It's the least comfortable business class seat I have had so far. Luggage is not automatically forwarded to connecting flights (my case in AMS). As a consequence, in such cases the airline will sell you tickets with unusually long stopovers. - It was not possible to reserve a specific seat on some flights. You might get assigned the worst possible seat at check-in. Amenities were standard. No socks or pijama top, so you sleep in your clothes. On the plus side: food and drinks were excellent, staff was very helpful and friendly. Also, the seat had a handy foldaway table which could swivel to allow you to get in or our your seat, without having to clear the table. That's very handy when dining or working - other airlines should take not. I will review the A330 flight separately, as it had a different business class cabin."

Garuda Indonesia had arranged a car to pick up me and drop me off at the airport. Upon arrival at Jakarta Terminal 3 the Garuda First-Class ground support team were waiting for me. They assisted in checking me in and, then took me through immigration and straight into the lounge. There was a choice of buffet type food or there was a menu to order from and the selection was quite extensive. When time came to board the flight the ground support team were on hand to escort me to the aircraft. There was free complimentary Wi-Fi onboard and the connection for the total flight duration was excellent. The onboard service was excellent, and the cabin crew could not do enough to help and assist me. Additionally, they really go out of their way to make you very special. We landed at Heathrow Terminal-3 approx. 10 minutes ahead of schedule and when the door was opened I was first off the aircraft and escorted to Terminal-2 for my connecting flight. Another excellent flight on Garuda Indonesia. The sad part is that they will stop flying Jakarta-Heathrow route from end of October 2018 and this is a great shame as they really do have a great service both on the ground and in the air. They are totally worthy of their 5 Star rating."

Happy to have been given Platinum Trial Experience, but turned out to be disastrous. =Priority Luggage Tag meant nothing as my luggage did not come out earlier. On return flight, checked-in early at Changi Airport, was given access to DNata Lounge. Twice I asked the lounge receptionist if flight was ready for boarding, was told not ready yet, please wait. At 19:15 (15 min prior to supposedly take-off timing) I got restless, so got the receptionist call the gate. True enough, the gate staff forgot to call the lounge to inform the boarding. So I had to run all the way to the other end of the terminal and was rushed at gate, as if I was the culprit."

I think it was not only confusing but dangerous (if one goes to the wrong direction, can one end up in another country as all three are international flights). A lot of ground staff around the gate but very inefficient, they did not seem know what to do, so yelled at each other in loud voices. Then we still had to walk a long way through a stuffy corridor to get to the aircraft (parked in domestic area). It was such an irony as I saw Narita-bound LCC Air Asia used the gate next door alone so that passengers did not have to walk far and no chaos. Boarded, was shocked by the new Diamond seat that looked and felt cheap (same design as in their B777 Business but of low-cost material), the design was poor, there was a huge gap between the aircraft window to the seat that anything could easily fall through, and one would have to bother the passenger behind to retrieve. Amenity was worse, of very cheap quality. The food and entertainment menu has not changed in forever, a frequent traveller easily gets bored! Overall did not feel like a genuine 5-star experience, but a fake one!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Denpasar,October 2018,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,1.0,3,no,3,"  Melbourne to Denpasar. We received good service whilst we were on the plane, but off the plane, it's another matter. I would like to see Garuda taking lost property more seriously.  Two of us used Garuda's contact-us page to follow up on some lost property in the cabin. One week later there has been no response despite our email address details being left on the form. Phone calls with Garuda's Denpasar office were difficult and unhelpful regarding lost property. We were passed to multiple people before being brushed off. Currently, Garuda's written policy is to take zero responsibility for cabin items, which in our experience, seems to have rippled through to a lack of regard from staff and process.  In an environment where significant fares are paid, passengers are known and seats are numbered, better efforts should be made to track items if they are left behind. It's great to have a diligent cabin crew who made sure we were well fed on the flight. However, we’ve been frustrated by the experience, tracking our lost iPad to a location in West Java with no support from Garuda."

I had the pleasure of flying Garuda First Class before they discontinue the London route and it was an absolute joy. The cabin crew were so kind and friendly and the food and comfort on the flight second to none. Upon arrival at Jakarta all first class passengers were escorted through immigration and were seated in a waiting lounge while their bags were collected and delivered to them. Such a great service which I cannot recommend highly enough. Returning from Jakarta to London in Business Class was vastly different to the first class experience and not as good as I have previously experienced. There is evidence of cost cutting both in the amenity kit and also the food used noticeably cheaper ingredients. The service from the cabin crew was lacking compared to my previous trips. On the evidence of this, I doubt if I will bother to use Garuda long haul again as it involves going via Amsterdam and there are plenty of other good choices out there. It's a shame really as over the last few years it has been a pleasure to travel Garuda but all good things come to an end!"

Check-in opened at 05:30am for the 0725am. At check-in it was a little confusing how Dnata the Garuda agent starts the check-in process. I was first in line at the business class check-in lane, however economy class opened first. At the immigration I tried to used the auto gate for clearing immigration, however it did not work so had to go to normal channel, this caused a little delay. I used the Dnata lounge which Garuda uses In Singapore and the lounge and staff are very good and helpful. I had breakfast in the lounge as there was a broad selection of both eastern and western food available. I was assisted from the lounge to the gate by the Garuda ground support staff and the boarding process was orderly. We push back from the gate a little a head of schedule and arrived in Jakarta 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Upon arrival in Jakarta the Garuda ground staff met me at the gate and helped me through immigration and retrieval of my luggage. I had to go to the domestic terminal to meet my family who were traveling on another Garuda flight and the Garuda ground staff were very helpful by escorting me all the way from the International terminal to the domestic terminal.

Their FA's were welcoming and attentive as soon as you board the aircraft. The Boeing 777ER is comfortable with fully flat beds which is the only way to go on a long leg. Their meals are individually prepared and plated with personalised service to match. However, the recently changed amenity kits (Clarins) compared to the previous L'Occitane kits is a backward step, but no doubt a cost saving. But overall, Garuda offers great value and from our experience and generally depart and arrive on time. Onwards and Upwards. They tick the box!"

Although they used a small 737 for this period of time, I was very satisfied with the service, meals and d4inks on board etc. A generous 40 kg for my ticket, Sky team lounge access in HKG. On board the service was very courteous and efficient. 3 choices of Indonesian inspired menu, a good selection of drinks (must try their coffee). It is well known across the industry that Garuda Indonesia has some of the best flight attendants, and the flight more than proved itself. Arrived at DPS on time, but needed to use bus. I was delighted to see for us J class passengers, we got our own bus, instead of cramming us with the all the others, a very nice touch. Priority luggage were delivered first to. All in all, I am thoroughly impressed."

Just returned from my much awaited trip with Garuda in Business class, I was seated at 6A. The lounge in Jakarta is perfectly ok,  not like the Middle East carriers and no apparent alcoholic drinks on display but when requested they appear from somewhere. Additionally no diet drinks in fridge but they appear from somewhere when requested. I find this all a bit strange and certainly doesn’t provide any visual improvement to services provided. It does though (in my opinion) present some clear evidence of what’s doing on in the minds of Garuda’s team - not trying too hard are they? Boarding was usual chaotic mess which again is very easily managed if they try hard enough. As someone who usually flies Qatar or Oman Air, the moment I stepped onboard I could see an immediate difference for the worse. They aren’t engaged with you.  Seat was fine, but movie selection old and limited. The biggest issue is service - there isn’t any. Not unless it’s the regular points where they come to ask which meals you want. During the 14 hr flight the NEVER came to ask if I wanted anything or if I’d like a drink topped up. I pressed the call button and that made no difference either. I sat with an empty glass for 45mins. I eventually went up and asked directly.  They were very reluctant to make eye contact of speak to the customers around me. Finally the onboard purser was worse than useless. He in my opinion may be at the root of the problem. Not one did he speak to anyone on business despite pacing around between 1st and business. Over the last few weeks I’ve sent several messaged through their support forms and you guessed it - no reply at all. Even follow up messages to investigate why I’ve had no reply. In summary I will not be using them again and suggest far better service is achieved by booking one of the Middle East airlines - cheaper too. "

I was very satisfied with the overall experience, however I hear that Garuda Indonesia might be cancelling this London service from end of October 2018 as I was unable to book any flight from that date onwards.

After a few more emails I made another call and was told there is no compensation for me, without any explanation. "

This delay caused us to make a dash to the connecting LHR flight in JAK. With 30 or so passengers making the connection, Garuda did the right thing by delaying the departure of Flight GA86 to LHR and escorting us through the airport to the gate. The A330 (MEL-JAK) had a 2-2-2 layout in an older style cabin, but it was comfortable. The B777-300 (JAK-LHR) had a 1-2-1 layout. It was a more modern cabin. Service was excellent with good quality food on both flights. Cabin crew tended to 'disappear' after clearing up the meal. IFE worked fine but the choices of movies was limited. Music choices were also lacking. Minor quibbles that won't affect my overall rating. A fine airline!"

What the airline has going for them are  the very friendly and helpful flight attendants,  reasonably comfortable seats for the 1.5 hour flight,  good benefits for their Gold and Platinum tier frequent fliers (lounge access, priority boarding, priority check-in counter, additional check-in luggage). What they need to improve on are the in flight meals (repetitive and no change for long periods of time),  repetitive on board announcements (starts with the flight service manager going through exactly what is found in their safety briefing video) and  the lack of bin space for carry on luggage (this one is the result of an overly lenient policy on passengers allowing oversize and multiple bags). Despite shortcomings, GA is a decent airline to fly with and are generally on time with their flights."

When it came time to board the Garuda Ground Staff were on hand to escort me and my daughter to the aircraft. Like most night flights myself and my daughter got some sleep. However, when we awoke we were presented with a menu which had a broad selection of food and drinks to chose from. The cabin was full, however, the cabin crew were able to cater to all in line with the usual Garuda Indonesia’s high level of service. Great cabin crew and they certainly brighten up your flight with their warm genuine smiles. The Cabin Crew were very attentive to my daughter and provided her with several meals and snacks throughout the flight and did this with a warm and sincere smile. Garuda Indonesia are certainly in a class of their own when it comes to service with a smile. Upon arrival in Jakarta we were met by the Garuda Ground Support Team and we were taken through Fast Track Immigration and on to collect our luggage. Great team of people that Garuda should be very proud of."

In any event Garuda is a well-deserved Skytrax 5 Star airline v Qantas 4 Star. Garuda staff are excellent - check-in was flawless, off to the lounge (ironically QF in Perth) and an on time departure. A glass of champagne and a hot towel while settling in, really good service through the trip, and the very welcome flat bed on the A330. The difference between business class on the A330, and 737 of other operators is stark. Meals were very good, wine choices excellent, entertainment a little limited when compared to other carriers but ok. Overall experience worth the extra cost of biz-class... including being able to leave aircraft and get to immigration first. No luggage? You're out the door quickly and heading for your transport. Return journey also good, although 7pm departure was changed to 9pm, making it a late arrival in Perth. First world problem. Garuda is a class act. Qantas could learn a few lessons!"

The flight attendants were friendly, but service was not great as they tended to spend a lot of time in the galley. With such a small number of passengers, they should have been more visible in the cabin & I should not have had to use the call button. Food had no choice of starter, three choices of main courses and one dessert – no cheese course. Perhaps the meal service was more premium economy than business class. "

The flight was delayed departing Jakarta by approx. 25 minutes, however we arrived in London on schedule and by the time I cleared immigration at Heathrow my luggage was waiting for me. The onboard cabin crew were excellent, and nothing was any bother for them. The onboard food was excellent and very well presented. Garuda Indonesia senior management need to appreciate their Ground Support Staff as well as their Cabin Crews as they are a credit to Garuda Indonesia and one of the reasons why I continue to fly Garuda Indonesia as the service is just outstanding. When I fly Garuda Indonesia is like I am meeting my friends as when I arrive at the airport and when I board the plane as that is how the Garuda Ground Staff and Cabin Crews make you feel and it is 100% genuine."

Arrival is to Jakarta was ok, however luggage took longer that expected to come out i.e. approx. 25 minutes after landing. Overall on-board service is good.

No apology, nothing. When I complained to Garuda, I didn’t get an answer to my mails. Garuda in the Netherlands answered after a considerable wait but just confirmed that by Indonesian law I needed to accept this. Garuda's response was unsatisfactory especially knowing that we paid a significantly higher price for the direct flight, have lots more travel time and now due to Garuda were late for meeting with our friends. because we were informed last minute, all other flight options from other airlines had already been booked so we were left with no alternative. Garuda send us 2 days in advance e ticket boarding cards for the direct flight which had been cancelled. when we complained on this the answer was that it was just a mistake. an airline which sends boarding cards for non existing, cancelled flights? From Manado to Jakarta (a 3 hour flight), the inflight entertainment system did not function no communication was made during the flight why this occured. The second flight I got a chair without a left armrest it was broken off meaning that the chair could not be reclined and the headphone sound didn’t work with the inflight entertainment system."

Surprisingly cabin crew did not take notice of how warm the cabin until several passengers complained to them and we were almost approaching destination when the temperature started to cool down.

While the quality of the service in the air is good, on the ground it is bad. They outsource their ground staff at Heathrow to DNata, who couldn't care less. My wife was one kilo over in business class and the woman behind the counter was incredibly rude. They advertise business promo fares on their website as being refundable and changeable. If you attempt to change a flight, however, they advised me that the ticket is not changeable. No local office where you bought the ticket will help you, they will refer you to the Indonesian headquarters, which are full of  staff reading off scripts and there is no escalation process to speak to anyone who can help. Our schedule changed four times from booking to takeoff, and their staff accidentally cancelled my frequent flyer account and refused to add back miles from my flights. The lounge in Jakarta has very little air conditioning so you sweat the whole time you're in transit, the food is bad, there was no alcohol and the seating is uncomfortable.

I think the only words he said to me during the flight were welcome onboard, when I boarded the aircraft. The purser should set the standard. He (she) should come to each pax at the commencement of the flight and welcome them on board and/or thank each pax at the end of the flight. This particular flight was not full in business class and yet not once did a flight attendant mention me by name. The minimum would be use each pax name when they are taking meal orders. At one stage I was asked if I would like still or sparkling water, when I asked for soda water, I was informed that Garuda did not stock soda water so sparkling water was ok. Then I ordered some Chablis, again later in the flight when I asked for another glass of chablis, I was told that that there was none left. Again, not the end of the world, however as I mentioned earlier, the flight was not full in business class and there were quite a few children (who don't drink alcohol), so the amount uploaded seems to be insufficient. When dessert was served (it was supposed to be served with ice cream) I asked where the ice cream was and was informed that it wasn't uploaded. So a cold dry cake was not very palatable. As food the food itself. It wasn't horrible, but was not great. An amuse bouche with mashed tuna in a half piece of choux. Then minced salmon with over-cooked scallops, followed. And the main course of sea bass was a little dry."

Furthermore they took my luggage from the plane and had directly taken to my connecting flight. This was Garuda Indonesia at its best i.e. Captain onboard calling ahead requesting the ground team to arrange assistance to ensure that I did not miss my connecting flight. I must say a big thank you to the Garuda Captain and the Garuda Heathrow support team, they certainly pulled out all the stops to ensure that I did not miss my connecting flight.

The check in process was smooth and easy. The flight departed on time from Kupang to Surabaya but when departing from Surabaya to Jakarta there were slight delay. When the aircraft reached Jakarta, it was parked at gate that was very far from the transfer desk and baggage collection. As the connection at Jakarta was only 1hr 30min and the delay cause it to be less than 1 hr transit, we need to rush at Jakarta and walk long way to the international terminal. From Jakarta to Singapore, the boarding was on time but the pushed back was very long, we wait at the aircraft for an hour. As Jakarta Airport was very crowded, we finally took off after 1 hour 30 minutes delay. For A330 i think Garuda has reduced some crew members as the serving of food was slow and due to turbulence, the food cannot be served temporarily.

The flat beds were adequately comfortable (so much better that the awful ironing board beds on Virgin Atlantic 787 aircraft - the worst Business Class ever). Flight attendants were excellent, the food of good quality and beautifully presented. We have flown to Australia with many different airlines over the years and Garuda is amongst the best.

I found that Garuda had arranged for one of their support team members at Heathrow Terminal-3 to escort me all the way through to my connecting flight in Heathrow Terminal-2. This was an excellent service and one I much appreciated as I only had 2 hours after landing from Jakarta and my connecting flight. Garuda Indonesia went the extra mile to show that they look after their premier customers."

Everything was perfect! The flight attendant gave some help when I want to have some my stuff in the top compartment and helping an old lady when she's a bit dizzy. Also the airplane condition was great. But I think the Airbus A330-200 need some revitalization, because my AVOD not so responsive, and its look a bit old.

The ground staff at CGK a bit in rush between gate 15 and 16. And boarding time a bit late, but it still smooth. The airplane seat configuration is 2-4-2 with space leg room,comfortable seat and the airplane was clean. But the AVOD's a bit not responsive, so I used more on the remote than the touch screen. Also when boarding process, the flight attendant gave help to people who transit from Umrah flights ( some elderly ) with care and passion. The flight was great.  I definitely will fly with them again."

Check in was straight forward as I arrived just as they were opening the Check In and there was no queue. The lounge that Garuda Indonesia uses in Singapore is the Dnata Lounge which is good and has a reasonable selection of food. Boarding for the GA 823 is via a bus as the aircraft is parked in a remote location. This is not a major issue as boarding is orderly. The flight itself was good and cabin crew were attentive and there was a good selection of breakfast food available on board. We arrived in Jakarta on schedule, however luggage took longer than normal i.e. approx. 20 minutes after landing. Other than that good flight overall."

The Lounge was comfortable and there was a reasonable selection of food available. The flight itself was good, however we were delayed due to congestion at Soekarno-Hatta airport, however the arrival into Singapore was only slightly behind schedule. The captain kept us updated during the delay process and I thought was very considerate.

It was smooth boarding and plane left on time. I was seated second row from the back which has 2-3-3 seating even though the layout is 2-4-2 in general. Plenty of legroom with 33 inch seat pitch. Flight attendants serve delicious warm food was more than i expected. When I found a good movie i was going to watch instead they cut it off and played a kid-prankster show for everyone in the plane for 1.5 hours.

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,First Class,London to Jakarta,December 2017,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3,yes,7,"  While the overall trip was amazing, many aspects fell short. Upon checking in, I learned that 5 out of 8 passengers in First class had upgraded. As a full fare F passenger, I was disappointed because not only I ended up paying a lot more, but also I'd be in a packed cabin translating to less personal attention by the crew. The difference was full fare F passengers were personally escorted to the lounge and onto the plane. The lounge at LHR was very crowded. I had a reserved table waiting for me at the lounge and I was able to use the shower for free. However, champagne was not complimentary and I had to pay GBP6 per flute if I order one. Boarding was fantastic as I boarded before it began and I was offered champagne right away by the fantastic crew. They had 2 types of champagne on offer and I ended up trying both during boarding. I saw my neighbour had red and white wine - so I assume you can pretty much order whatever drinks you'd like. It was obvious the crew were slightly overwhelmed as 1 crew kept on addressed me by the wrong name on 2 occasions. She was apologetic and I had no problem with it. I received a kit with very mediocre content (worse than the kit I got when traveling GA J a year before).  However, upon landing, I was given the proper F kit by the ground staff and I was informed they ran out while in London. This might sound trivial, but I ended up noticing things like these when I was flying First. The service was nothing short of spectacular, crew went above and beyond from preparing a wine tasting session (GA had 6 different wine) to sharing holiday stories. Meals were also good. I found the seat to be very comfortable for lounging and sleeping (a duvet was provided for turn down service). IFE could use more selection on movies and complete seasons of TV shows. Arrival service was another major let down for me. Despite receiving a confirmation prior to the trip that I could use their J lounge for a shower after landing in Jakarta (they could not grant me access to their F lounge which was odd considering they granted passengers access when they have a connecting flight even on non-GA flight), I was disappointed to learn upon landing that I could only use the arrival lounge. It was barely a lounge, it was more of a room with small seating areas for F/J pax to wait for their luggages plus 1 shower stall. They did not have a towel in the shower room and nothing could be done by the clueless staff manning the lounge. Overall, GA's F was a very solid product, but I would not pay full fare to fly on it."

First time flying on a CRJ1000 on GA's ExploreJet brand and I was surprised at how much leg room there was. I was unfortunate to have picked a seat on one of those awkward rows between two windows so I had to lean forward or crane my neck behind me to look out the window which was disappointing but I blame only my poor luck. The plane was clean and comfortable. Flight attendants were fantastic. For this short domestic flight, we only got a small snack box consisting of bread, an Indonesian rice cake snack called lemper, and the flight attendants served a variety of drinks. All were just enough to fill you but nothing more. There was no IFE. Overall a short but comfortable and pleasant flight."

The cabin crew did an exceptional job  and upon my return, the Maitre du Cabin greeted every passenger on business class to thank them for choosing Garuda Indonesia. The food selection were of three main courses and mostly were of Asian influence. Both presentation and quality were superior and I wish they collaborate permanently with renown chefs as their panels. Quality of amenity and toiletry kits have been upgraded to Clarins which feel more luxurious. If there's downside of the flights would be the choices of beverages which were  limited. Choices of alcoholic beverages look somewhat dull and dry compared to other airlines and they still don't provide signature cocktail and mocktail until now which is a pity. All in all, I'd recommend to take business class of Garuda Indonesia, as they gave me nice and comfortable service during my flights."

My problem was the ground officers from check in desk - excess baggage payment desk - baggage loading in Soekarno Hatta Airport. I had almost 20kg of excess baggage with 2 bags. The check in counter was displayed less than 1.5 hours prior to the scheduled flight, so went there and finally after 10 or 15 min i got my turn. I tried to move couple of stuff and continue checkin process in the other desk. I already had my boarding pass printed from the 1st desk, I should only need to drop my baggage here. I have to pay the excess in the other desk before my bags could be proceed. So,Ii went to the other desk, pay there and the girl told me that I could print the receipt and bring the note only with some notes from her because it was 13.00 my flight on 13.30 and i have to board immediately. I went back to the 2nd desk, run because terminal 3 is quite huge, and got questioned ""where is the receipt?"" I tried to explain but the girls still got nothing from my explanation, my bags were on hold not moving anywhere yet, she need to make a confirmation by run here and there and finally run to the previous 3rd desk - 15 minutes before boarding I run to the gate. Had to take the shuttle to the plane. The flight was on time, but the baggage were not and we have to wait for our baggage to be distributed the next day.  Please, fix your coordination in the checkin desk, at least install some internal phone."

I had a very good experience. The food and comfort were decent, and the staff service was very, very good: they were very polite and friendly. One issue that I did have was that there each seat did not have its own charging port on the aircraft used for these flights. Additionally, there is no vegetarian option available for the short haul, domestic  flights. This isn't a huge issue as the flights are very long, however, I was able to request a vegetarian meal for the Jakarta-Denpasar leg and to be told that they never have vegetarian options for this route was a little irritating, however, the staff were very apologetic about it. Overall, I had a very good experience with Garuda Indonesia and certainly recommend them."

Nothing was any bother to the cabin crew and the onboard chef prepared a fabulous meal. Arriving in Denpasar, Bali for our connecting flight to Yogyakarta we had to clear immigration and customs. This also was seamless with help of the Garuda ground support team who took us from the International arrivals to Domestic terminal. We had to wait in the lounge for approx. 35 minutes prior to boarding are flight to Yogyakarta, however during this time the Garuda support team were on hand to assist.

We got some good sleep before waking up 1 hour before landing to a very well-prepared breakfast. On arrival at Narita we were met by the Garuda ground support team and was escorted all the way through immigration and customs. This is a great, fast and efficient service.

Before take-off, a passenger had his seat reclined and fully extended forward. Only at the very last few minutes before take-off did the flight attendant ask this passenger to adjust his seat back to upright position. He only slightly adjusted the seat. Seat space and adjustment were not as comfy as in Cathay or SQ. The seat could only extend a certain distance forward or back before the seat back had to move to adjust. The food was sub-standard. My fave champagne Billecart-Salmon Brut Rose that used to be served was downgraded to a fairly ordinary brand. The entertainment was pathetic for me. I pressed the call button and no one came. So I turned off the notification light. I pressed the call button again. Still no one came and I finally had to flag down a flight attendant who walked past."

I had taken particular care booking a vegetarian meal for the flight. However, the same was not available on the flight. The flight attendent on GA 215, was completely inconsiderate and even said I could have the non-vegetarian meal instead. This complete lack of understanding is not what I expected from an airline that claims to be awarded for its service! Last year I had flown Garuda from Surabaya to Jakarta and I faced the same issue. Being a frequent traveller myself, vegetarian food is a basic option that all airlines across the world have. Hopefully this is the last time I fly with Garuda!"

Appalling flight from an airline that has worked hard to change its image over the years. After a mix up with the gates we trudged to our plane and were then bundled in and off we went. The staff seemed distracted from the moment we got on and the usual feeling of welcome was missing. I fly Garuda because it is not a budget airline, this flight was advertised as having a meal, I did not eat at some of the new restaurants in terminal 3 at Jakarta airport as I thought we would be eating on board. What we were offered on board was a packet of nuts or a strange wrapped chicken thing. The drinks trolley was practically empty and my travelling companion could not get a vodka and tomato juice. The plane did not appear as though it had been refilled. Disappointing as the food and drinks are usually good on Garuda flights. Trying to get staff attention during the flight was impossible, what was going on? Secret air cabin staff business?"

The flight itself was excellent as was the onboard services. The ground staff in Jakarta were excellent and on hand to help when we landed and help the baggage and process. However the same could not be said for the check in process at London Heathrow Airport. In London it was a complete shambles to say the least with many people roaming around not know where to check in. I waited for more that 1 hour for check in to open and there as no seating as the check in area is in a remote area of Heathrow Terminal-3. Garuda should be more considerate in highlighting the actual check in location and time of when check in will open. The check in process at Heathrow was the low point of an excellent flight."

Third time this year on Garuda and a bit of a delay (I can say ‘as usual’). The flight crew were as rated nice and friendly. Food variety was good, though not special. The inflight entertainment has the most recent movies however the way the movies are organized on the system could have been managed better.

I just wonder why we did not get any more candies before take off?, my suggestion since candy service is abolished, why not offer hot towel for long haul service such as to Australia, Japan or Europe. it is real good instead of candies. My suggestion is that you enlarge the meal portion a little bit, current portion is little too small."

I went to the bathroom after finishing my light supper, when I returned to my seat, the table had already been cleared.

The cabin crew were attentive, the food was surprisingly tasty on this flight, quite different to my last night flight a week before. I asked for coke zero (they offer it in business lounge) but sadly, there's no coke zero inside, so they offered me another choice of drink. The flight was good, a bit turbulent when we are flying on East Java. We landed on schedule and baggage came out quickly. I love their baggage service in Soekarno Hatta."

Starting from the airport transfer confirmation, ground staff handling and check in agent at the home airport, lounge and up to world class cabin crew who always full of hospitality and friendliness. One thing was beyond my expectation upon arrival at Schiphol, where I had flight to Basel with non-SkyTeam member and the ground staff were really helpful and made my transit and luggage transfer very smooth and I was not in hassle at all. They left in me comfort for my next flight. Two thumbs up Garuda for all the amazing service. Very satisfied and definitely flying back again to Europe."

Flight departed on time and arrived in Hong Kong at little ahead of schedule. The service at check in was excellent as there were attendants on hand to help us to proceed through immigration and to the lounge. Service in the lounge was good as was the boarding process. The on board meal service was very good and the cabin crew went out of their way to help and assist my two children. There was no Wi-Fi on board, however that was not an issue for a 4+ hour flight. Overall a very good service."

Boarding was announced 5 minutes early, and we departed on time. Crew were good but rather distant - they were very busy serving 150 passengers food and drinks on the 50-minute sector. Seat comfort was perfectly acceptable for such a short haul flight - a good amount of legroom, seat width that's as to be expected from a 737. Food and drinks were a step up from my outbound flight out of Jakarta - the mixed nuts were replaced with a small roll of cake. IFE, although not very responsive, had a decent amount of content similar to Garuda's widebody IFE offering."

The boarding process is again seamless and the on-board service is 5 star plus and the crew were very attentive as usual. On the return flight from Amsterdam to Jakarta on September 25th I received the same excellent service. Both the outbound and inbound flights were on schedule. After arriving in Jakarta I was met by the Garuda First Class Team at the aircraft door and was brought through formalities and on the road with my luggage in less than 15 minutes. Great service, however I just heard that from the end of October 2017 that Garuda will no longer be providing First Class on the Jakarta to Amsterdam route, what a shame."

Our plane was a well-maintained, Sky Interior 737. Seat comfort was top notch, with generous padding and comfortable headrests. Seat width was inadequate, although to be expected from a 737, while pitch was well above industry average. Crew were again nothing short of exceptional, and almost every one of my flights with them met or even exceeded my already high expectations for GA’s service delivery. IFE was perfectly fine, even for a medium haul international flight. However, the food suffered a major setback from my last short haul experience with them - what used to consist of a piece of bread and cake with mineral water is replaced with simply a piece of bread and mixed nuts. The mineral water is gone, although these can be requested from the crew. However where Garuda skimps in quantity, it compensates in quality. The bread was very good, as were the mixed nuts. All in all a very good experience, and would fly with them again given that they don’t make further cuts to the experience."

Never had a problem with Garuda before, but since I just had a baby, I found out that Garuda is not very baby friendly. One thing that's really inconvenient is they can't bring your stroller after you landed. You need to take it on the baggage claim. Ground crew say you can, turned out the stewardess don't know anything about the common practice of delivering a stroller."

I often fly Garuda, I notice the lack of consistency in the service quality. In this flight I'd say I experienced one of the worst. Prior to take-off the male FA closed the overhead compartment leaving part of amenity plastic bag dangling, despite a few rounds of take-off preparation checking by FAs, nobody noticed it that I had to warn him as it may increase the chance the compartment will open during take-off. From his response, I'd say he did not seem to understand the importance of the issue in view of safety. He also lacked basic skills in service, when serving food it seemed like he was doing it for the first time and was very clumsy, eg: giving me a cup of tea with sugar but no stirrer."

The FA's were efficient, attentive, made me feel truly at home. The after take-off snack of fusion of udon served in laksa-like soup was great. Unfortunately no more freshly squeezed orange juice available onboard, which was one of the unique features of Garuda Indonesia business class. They should consider bringing it back in particular for breakfast service. The selection of movies needs improvement, in particular the frequency of updates. As a frequent traveller with Garuda, I found it very boring as I have watched all that I like in the past few months."

However on the returning leg, there was several unexpected events. During check-in in Sydney, the staff checked my baggage as Priority and didn't tell me. So when I arrived in Jakarta I was confused, only to know later it was in the Premium Luggage Service. During the flight, I was a very dry, terrible rice with meat. I complained to the FA and to my surprise she offered me another portion that was a lot better. "

The service, save for a meal and drink choice, is equal to low cost carriers. I am told that GA has reduced its in flight service level for budgetary reasons. No welcome juice or water, no welcome towel, no menu, no pre dinner drink service, no spirits, only beer and wine during meal service, no tea or coffee service was offered, one has to ask.  No refresher towel before landing. On a positive note, the crew are fantastic."

We got the staff at our resort to ring (we sat their while they did it) to ensure there was no confusion with language problems.  We were advised by the staff at the resort it was sorted. Guess what no dietary requirements and we were advised we should have confirmed when we received our boarding passes that their needs were noted. They offered them bread rolls and yoghurt.

The flight attendants were no different to those of budget airlines - rushed, impatient, no smile. Seat was worn out, I didn't finish both meals on both flights.

The boarding process was very fast since it wasn't a full flight. Flight was departure on time, and arrived in Jakarta 10 minutes earlier. IFE was OK, not many latest or box office movie installed but still enough for this 1.5 hours of flight. But for me who flies with them frequently, I had already watched almost all of their movies. The FAs was very friendly, full of smile, and attentive. The food, they served 2 choices of hot meals, the taste was acceptable but the portion was small. The minus point of this flight was the terminal. Garuda Indonesia use Terminal 3 for it's operation, it's seems like the terminal need more lights to improve their lighting ambience. The arrival hall was dark and gloomy. They still have renovation going on here and there with noisy sound, even in the conveyer belt area. And we are waiting for almost to the last baggage even they already tag ""priority"" for our baggage. Overall, the inflight service was perfect, but the ground service and experience at their terminal in Jakarta could've been better."

We entered the jet bridge, and went downstairs where the bus was ready to commute us to the international section, and we must go upstairs agin via stairs beside the jet bridge and enter the aircraft. It's not easy for elderly or you travel with children. I didn't know why they didn't just move the aircraft to the domestic section since I spotted there were a lot of free jet bridge there.

Seat comfort good, 3-3-3 layout much more spacious and comfortable than the 3-4-3 that now dominates the industry on the 777. Flights on time.

Since our flight was going to depart at 6:45am, we had to depart from our hotel at around 4, arriving 45 minutes later by which point the check-in counters (there were six of them) were crowded. The flight was delayed by 5 hours, due to a perfect storm of a 2h late departure from Bali, bad weather at PEK, and unprecedented heavy congestion at PEK as well.  This delay would also eventually cause most of the passengers bound for Jakarta to miss their connecting flights. However,  Garuda rebooked every Jakarta-bound passenger on GA421 for free. Both legs were operated by a 2-class high-density 777. Economy seat comfort was top-notch, pitch was acceptable at 32 inches, and Garuda has 18.5"" wide seats in a 9-abreast configuration. Recline was large - 6 inches. IFE screens were 9"" wide and had swipe and scroll capabilities although they were still running on the older eX2 platform with the older monitors, and while the contents were hardly updated since June, they had 8 Live TV channels. Food, on the PEK-DPS leg, had a main course that tasted much better than the one I had on the previous CGK-PEK leg, but at the expense of portion (it was tiny.) The chocolate cake dessert tasted incredible. We were also treated to a bag of mixed nuts as well as sumptuous ice cream just before arrival in Bali. This streak of great tasting food continued on the DPS-CGK leg, with it tying for the best main course meal onboard Garuda I ever had. Service on the PEK-DPS leg was above the impeccable service on my previous CGK-PEK leg, with crew in very cheerful and bright spirits. Overall very satisfied with the Garuda onboard experience on this sector. As for PEK, I would have wished that they had a touch more humanity."

Ground service was exceptional and quick. The Executive Lounge, unfortunately, didn't have a large variety of food, and neither did it taste decent.  Seat pitch (at 32 inches) and comfort were a downgrade from previous seats on older A330s (these had amazing 33-34"" pitch), although still up there with the best carriers operating the A330. IFE was on an intuitive 11.1"" touchscreen - not quite the best, but still decent - with content that is hardly updated: it remained the exact same throughout the months of June and July. Food decent as well - nothing to write home about - albeit with noticeably smaller main course portions. However, the crew stood out on this flight - they were quick, attentive, professional, generous and friendly, providing genuine service. One thing to note: terrible 3am timing of arrival in Beijing caused most passengers to not get enough sleep. Also on this flight was a turbulence that rocked the plane for the majority of the flight - this further reduced my duration of sleep. Overall, an above average red-eye experience with Garuda."

We were given the usual welcome drinks and warm towels, and offered magazines. We were given an amenity kit including lotions, creams, sandals, eye mask, and a pretty useful ear buds. The food was worse than usual, they were okay, but far from the usual taste that I have experienced flying Garuda. We found the portions quite small, limited snacks, etc. There was a ""light bites"" section with some food including cut fruit. The in-flight entertainment was okay but they do not update movies very often. TV series were limited and outdated. The headphones are not that comfortable after a while but bearable. The seats were comfortable. Paid Wi-Fi is available but I do not find it very useful for anything other than email and text messaging."

The food was good and consisted of beef with vegetables and a chocolate/butterscotch cake with side salad and bread roll. I had a crisp glass of white wine. All food and beverages were free. I was allowed to use the front Business Class toilet as two trolleys were being used towards the rear of the plane. I watched one film and played some games on the fully functional screen. Finally, this is why this airline wins awards. The pilot had an excellent command of English and he went out of his way to provide quality information for the discerning geek which I am, the aeronautically inspired phrase ""10.8 NM remaining till 'Top of Descent'"" literally made my day!"

The bad things I hate is the headphone, the sound is bad and uncomfort, I always bring my own. The screen is just 10 inch, better than nothing. Wi-fi is poor connectivity."

Outbound leg on a 737-800 which was an unremarkable flight, aside from the timely departure from CGK. Seat pitch was average. IFE system was responsive with an above average load of movies and music programs. UI was great as well. Food was surprisingly decent and the plane was clean. This time the crew were professional and polite, but weren't too friendly. On the return flight a brand new A330 with redesigned seats. Seat pitch was below-average for Garuda and the older A330s felt more spacious. Seats also had less padding. There were huge 11"" touchscreens which was iPad-like with a responsive, albeit confused, and nearly impractical, UI, with the same IFE selection. Food was a downgrade from the outbound flight. Crew were very warm and friendly. "

From the first experience during check-in our luggages in DPS airport until we arrived in SYD airport, it seems Garuda Indonesia staff would like to show its pride and Indonesian culture to its customers. Really helpful cabin staff, good inflight menus, clean cabin and toilets, friendliness towards its passengers and willing to help were the most unforgettable memories. We had around 3 hours transfer in Jakarta airport. They provided its own bus to transfer us from Terminal 3 to Terminal 2 in CGK airport, without exiting the airport. At that time, the price for one-way flight from DPS to SYD was cheaper than its competitors. Wi-Fi was provided during flight and it was free for 15 minutes for economy passengers."

Overall a very good business class experience. Pros: Seat comfort on A330 and 777 good. Very comfortable lie flat in 777 and had good nights sleep. Service - excellent, friendly and obliging, Food - absolutely delicious. Some of the best food I have ever had in the air (definitely stick with the asian dishes, the western ones were less successful). Wine and drinks great as well. Terrific champagne which always makes me happy. Price - cheapest business class to Europe at the time of booking. On time - no delays. Cons: Jakarta stop over - it's long and the airport is dismal, likewise the lounge. I dont know if there's a refurb happening in the future but it needs it. IFE - not great selection. I had exhausted all options by the time we got to Jakarta. Ensured I slept more on flight through to AMS. In summary, given the price paid it was a very pleasant journey. They lack the polish of some of the big guns, but you would be hard pressed to find a better experience at this price."

The airport is impressive compared to the old one but there is a design flaw which is letting too much light so at day time it is very hot inside. After the delay, we were boarded on buses to the plane, which was odd because there are a lot of empty skybridges to be seen. The flight was delayed but Garuda provides food and drinks to compensate. The plane then taxis for 40 minutes, which was annoying but the crew apologized. After take off, meals were served and I am pleased that my special meal request was honored. Landing in Surabaya was smooth."

On my flight on 31 May, the flight was almost full. Shortly after takeoff, flight attendants came around for the lunch service. My choice was the curry chicken rice which tasted pretty good - not too spicy and marinated to just the right texture. The IFE system was a limited in its selection of movies and music. But for a 2-hour flight, it didn't matter to me. Overall, Garuda offers a reasonably good product for a reasonable price."

The customer service staff helped me quickly find my flight and book it. At the Premium check in for Business Class, Garuda had a very helpful staff. After check in and passing the security, I visited the lounge which had a great selection of food and drink and a relaxing foot massage. I used Sky Priority for boarding so I didn't have to queue. Onboard, the flight attendant offered me a welcome drink and a hot towel. Then after the plane took off, the FA served the inflight meal which was Opor Ayam (Chicken with Indonesian Curry seasoning) followed by selection of fruits and drinks (orange / apple juice, tea, coffee or milk). I was not interested in the AVOD because it was only a 54 minute flight. Business Class pax had priority to disembark first, after reaching the terminal building baggage handling staff collected my baggage as part of the premium arrival service. Overall, Garuda Indonesia still my favourite airline because they have very helpful staff and serve me professionaly."

Cabin crew were nice and polite. Cabin and toilet were clean. I am just a bit surprised that Garuda does not any longer offer candies. They have done it since I was small. Although I often see people take it and just put them in their bags but it has been part of the service since long time and it is part of unique Garuda service. AVOD was good. Take off and Landing were always good. Food portion was a little small although they were nice. What I can suggest to Garuda being 5 star airlines are that 1. Provide back those candies, 2. Possiblly give us hot towel for international routes after take off, 3. orange juice offer before take off (you used to to that but I dk if you still do it to over 4 hour services), 4. Please offer fresh pudding instead of wong coco kind of pudding got from supermarket. "

The first leg was on a standard 737. Seat pitch was mediocre at best, seat comfort unremarkable. IFE was of the newer, more responsive interface. Unfortunately, plane was hot, and we were served snacks for the 80 minute sector. However, the snacks were tasty. The second flight was on an ATR72 from BWX to SUB on GA7305. This sector was delayed by an hour, but compensation was more than enough - two discount vouchers. Although this was a short 30-minute hop, the legroom, snacks and crew were all great. Flight was perfectly smooth although we passed through thick clouds. Finally was GA323, SUB-CGK onboard an ancient 747. We were seated on the upper deck, and this gave a sense of tranquility and peace as there were very few other people.  Despite the age, the 747 was amazingly comfortable, with cold cabins and calming ambient lighting. Seat pitch was well above average. Crew were very professional, courteous and friendly. This was a great throwback to the 1990's and did not disappoint at all, despite the lack of a proper IFE. One of the best flights of my life thus far, despite the turbulence. Too bad the 747s have been retired now. Overall it was a really enjoyable experience on Garuda, except for the rather mediocre first sector of the trip. Would definitely recommend this airline."

Overall all staff on the ground and in the air were professionals, polite, very smiley, engaging and went out of their way to make you feel at home. Seats are large business class seats and it must be only European carriers that provide these ridiculous Y class seats with no room in business with a seat kept free in-between. BA is worst of all in my view. All flights on time, bags out in minutes.. They well deserve their rating for making travel to easy."

The options were japanese chicken rice and the other one was fish with rice, yet only the fish left. The crew showed me the fish rice, which personally I must say very not appetizing. Then, he took initiative to try to find me the Japanese chicken rice, which was completely finished on board. Finally, he went to the galley, and offered the crew meal, which was chicken with indonesian yellow rice. I agreed to take this. I was amazed by the crew's action to go beyond my expectations.

On arrival to DPS from CGK I was escorted me to arrival where my baggage is waiting. We go to the International check-in counter where they prepared everything (luggage, boarding pass, etc). After check in we proceed to the immigration. However, I was kinda dissapointed as there was no fast lane and I stood for 15 minutes (I think Garuda should've provided a premium fast lane for their first class passenger to avoid any airport hustle). The lounge is not as impressive as they have in CGK, it's a small but functional lounge with a few sets of table for a la carte dinner and relaxing chair. Nothing much too review, but with excellent service from lounge staff.  When it was already time to board my assistant then came to me and escorted me to the boarding gate. Excellent service from the first class ground staff in DPS. Crew warmly welcomed me by giving their signature Salam Garuda. One of crew escorted me to my seat 1A and poured a Billecart Rose along with nuts and Oshibori. The purser prepared the caviar served with blinish, sour cream and prawn cracker (Indonesian style as the crew called it). It was delicious.. 30mins later the chef on board approached me and discussed about my menu for breakfast.  After finished my meal, I asked the crew to prepare my bed that comes with a duvet and it was so comfy. As I woke up 4.5 hrs later, the crew served an orange juice before they prepared my Japanese Kaiseki Meal (the presentation was excellent). The chef then came to me to ask for my opinion and I think that's a good thing as they tried to interact and get a feedback from the passenger.  The plane then start to descend when the breakfast service finished, and 1 hour later we landed smoothly at NRT airport. Overall, the first class ground crew and cabin crew service were really impressive. The seat itself is spacious and very comfy. It's only the lounge and no fast lane which was an issue for me."

The flight attendants on my flight were nice and friendly but a bit slow to respond to passengers. After we took off, no snacks and drinks served and we were anticipating whether there'd be snacks service or not. One hour later, the flight attendants came up with the main course, which in is a bit late as passengers were asleep or hungry to wait. We're also given sandwich in the middle of the flight and the selection of snacks which are potato chips and healthy bars, no fresh fruit provided. On a positive notes, lavatories were clean, main courses are great in terms of presentation, taste and portion and of course the amenities provided during the flight are clean and comfortable.

Outward journey was super - the crew were simply charming and nothing was too much bother for them. Meals were great and despite the turbulent weather conditions we slept well. Our return journey was still comfortable as the seats are very good but there was not the same level of kindness of professionalism from the crew and the food wasn't great. They also have cheapened the amenity kit from when we went out which is a shame as the previous one was very nice. I hope Garuda are not going down the BA route of cost-cutting otherwise they'll spoil what is a superb airline to fly well up to its 5 start rating. Overall still good flights but a marked difference between the two journeys.

We felt that nothing was too much trouble. Food and drink were excellent and included a good quality Laurent-Perrier NV Rosé and a De Bortoli Noble One. Entertainment options were good with a decent choice of on-demand video and audio. We were slightly disappointed that the service didn't use the newer fully-flat beds but we had no problem sleeping during this night flight. It has to be said that the lounge at Denpasar is adequate but substandard. Overall though this was an enjoyable, comfortable and on-time experience. I'd certainly recommend Garuda.

We had two short transfers on the way out and Garuda staff helped us negotiate our way around strange airports. The one hitch we had was that our luggage did not make it onto the last plane (due to late arrival shortening the transfer slot) but this was sorted out efficiently on arrival.

Haven't used Garuda for almost a decade, heard that they made great progress, was looking forward to prove it and was not disappointed. Checked-in online and drop off bag at new Terminal 3 Cengkareng-Jakarta. At this moment Terminal 3 was exclusively used for Garuda domestic flights, it was huge and airy, with nice features and lots of open space but can do with more informative signage such as required time to get to a certain gate by foot. The aircraft was parked away on a stand and we have to be bused from the terminal building. It was very inconvenient, considering there were so many gates/airbridges we saw that were vacant, and also the fact that the bus trip creating delay for the flight since last busload of passengers had to wait for passing aircrafts before it was able to cross the tarmac! The flight left almost an hour late because of this boarding process and arrived 30 minutes later than scheduled. However the service throughout the flight made up to the issue. We were greeted warmly when we enter the plane by FAs, candies were distributed while waiting for the remaining passengers, and there was announcement from the flight deck about the reasons why the flight was delayed. Flight deck also informed on the expected arrival time and weather conditions in Pekanbaru before we start the descent. The seats have large seat pitch and tons of legroom, perhaps up to 32-33 inches between seats. There is seatback personal touchscreen entertainment system with adequate selection of movies, music and TV series, enough to keep entertained for short flights up to 3-4 hours. For this short flight (1 hour 10 minutes) there was full service hot breakfast and drinks. The FAs were really polite, courteous and helpful, and they give great service with a smile. They were very personable. When I got on board, I asked if they have a certain type of merchandise (an airplane model). They told me they would look for it, and they promptly helped me with the purchase right after breakfast service without being asked twice. Restrooms were clean and were kept clean throughout the flight. Kudos to Garuda for being able to get it right, and to their people for giving a warm personable service to their passengers."

Garuda are the only carrier to offer a non-stop service on this route and the scheduled journey time is 13 hours and 50 minutes - the longest non-stop flight I've done. The cabin was very pleasant, with a warm and homely feel to it. The crew were very welcoming and pre-departure drinks were offered. Shortly after take-off, the crew took orders for dinner and the food was excellent - the best airline meal that I have had. As other reviews have noted, all business class seats have direct access to the aisle, which is fantastic. The seats were very comfortable and the blanket was almost like a duvet - very impressive. This ensured a comfortable sleep. The cabin crew remained friendly throughout the long flight and nothing was too much trouble for them. It was a real pleasure to travel on this airline and I would definitely opt for Garuda when travelling this route in the future. The only anomaly is that Garuda don't offer a non-stop service from Jakarta to London. Flights touch down in Singapore for a fuelling stop or there is the option to transit in Amsterdam. Hopefully this will be addressed in the future. Overall, this was an excellent flying experience at a competitive price. The only reason I have not given 10 out of 10 is for lounge experience at Heathrow - this was overcroaded and in desperate need of refurbishment."

Additionally, the plane was a standard 737 which was not very comfortable for sleeping. IFE was the old version with mediocre touchscreens.

Following a 3 hour ""layover"" at Jakarta, I was ready the continue my onward flight to Singapore. Business class on the 737 was a 2-2 configuration and I had the front 2 seats to myself with another passenger occupying the other 2 front row seats across the gangway. Otherwise, business class was empty but economy appeared to be full. These are not lie flat seats but given the relative shortness of the flight, (1hour 30 minutes) offer more than adequate space and comfort. I was greeted warmly by the steward who addressed me by my name and offered a warm towel and champagne prior to departure. I was asked for my choice of post take off drink and my choice for dinner which consisted of a mixed salad with dressing, and then a choice from 3 main courses, followed by desert. In addition to the Champagne, there was a choice of 2 white and 2 red wines to accompany the meal. All 3 courses of the dinner were served together which, given the relative shortness of the flight, was not unreasonable, and my choice of Fillet Mignon with accompanying vegetables was excellent. The crew were very attentive and provided an excellent level of service throughout the flight. I was asked by the steward if I objected to an economy class passengers cabin bag being placed in a business class over head bin because the economy class bins were all full. On arrival at Singapore, disembarkation at Changi was swift but business class passengers are not offered a fast track pass through immigration, although this did not prove to be a problem as there were few arriving passengers. The only negative about this service is that despite being labelled clearly as business class priority luggage, my bag arrived on the carousel last! Not sure if this is something to do with the bags being transferred from the London flight, but I did spend a few anxious minutes waiting and wondering if it hadn't been loaded onto the flight. Overall however, a most pleasing experience and one that I would happily experience again."

Priority check in was excellent as was the fast track pass through security. Garuda do not have their own dedicated lounge at LHR and I was directed to the Number 1 traveller lounge which was a disappointment. Very busy, it was impossible to obtain a table in the dining area and I managed to eventually find an empty seat in the lounge area. Leaving this to go to the bar to obtain a drink, my seat had been taken when I returned! Once on board the aircraft, the service was superb. Pre boarded and greeted by my name, I was shown to my seat (6K) and offered Champage and hot towel. My order was taken for post take off drinks and the In flight meal. After take off the drink was served promptly and courteously and I was again addressed by my name. Dinner consisted of a choice of 4 appetizers,4 main courses, cheese and biscuits and a choice of 2 desserts and each course was served separately. A selection of Champagne, 3 white wines, 3 red wines and a desert wine complimented the meal, although this aspect of the service was a little slower and the crew seemed suprised that I wanted white wine with the appetizer and then change to red wine with the main course. The seat was particularly comfortable and had direct aisle access (1-2-1 configuration) despite being a window seat. Following a good night's sleep, I enjoyed a pleasant breakfast of fresh fruit, yogurt and cereals followed by a choice from 3 dishes on the main course. In addition, hot and cold snacks were available on demand during the flight plus a selection of tea and coffee. The crew were discreet but attentive throughout and made the journey a real pleasure. The flight was punctual and it didn't feel as though I'd spent 14 hours on board. Overall, very impressed. Thoroughly enjoyed the flight but I'd like to see Garuda use a different lounge at LHR."

Business class check in was fast and efficient and I was provided with an invitation to the Dnata lounge which was quiet and relaxing prior to the long flight back to London. Boarding was on time and business class passengers were offered priority boarding. There are 2 business class cabins on Garuda's 777 and I chose seat 6K (the same as on my outbound flight), immediately behind the 1st class cabin, that appeared to be empty. I'm not sure how many business class passengers were in the 2nd business cabin, but I had the entire front cabin to myself. The customary glass of champage and hot towel were provided prior to take off along wth my order for a post take off drink and my selection for lunch. This consisted of a choice from 4 appetizers, 4 main courses, cheese and a choice of 2 deserts. The identical wine selection of Champagne, 3 white wines, 3 red wines and a desert wine were offered as on the outbound flight. Garuda also place significant importance on the selection of teas and coffees that they offer with no fewer than 6 different teas and 2 coffees, that can be served 8 different ways. The whole food and beverage service was excellent in terms of quality, presentation and service. Despite this being a flight operating throughout daylight hours and arriving into Heathrow in the early evening, I personally prefer to try and stay awake as much as possible to re accustom myself to English time, but I've noticed that all airlines that I've used on Westbound daylight flights insist on lowering the window shades and plunging the cabin into darkness after the meal and Garuda are no different. Surely it's better to let the natural daylight in and use the provided eye shades if you want to snooze. Having the cabin to myself resulted in me lifting the window blinds and bringing natural daylight back into the cabin. I doubt that this would have been tollerated if there had been other passengers in the vicinity. I.F.E. with Garuda is okay but there seems to be an accent towards Far Eastern films and my perception of Western offerings seemed somewhat dated. Prior to landing at Heathrow another meal consisting of a choice of 3 appetizers, 3 main courses and 1 desert were offered, that Garuda describe as ""refreshment,"" but was in fact a full early evening meal. An on demand cafe service of nuts, chocolate bars, soup etc. is also provided throughout the flight. Disembarkation at Heathrow was swift and efficient and a fast pass was provided for immigration although Heathrow would do well to have more staff on duty (only 2 when I arrived) as I'm not convinced that there is any significant advantage to this service. Luggage reclaim was fast with my bag first on the carousel. The actual process from disembarking to picking up my car in terminal 3's car park took 25 minutes which was pretty impressive. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable flight. Unlike some better known, perhaps more fashionable Middle Eastern airlines, Garuda offer the advantage of all business class seats on their 777's having gangway access, so you don't have to be a gymnast trying to climb over someone with their seat fully reclined if you're in a window seat, and wish to move about the cabin. This in itself is a definate advantage flying with this airline. Service is attentive and personable without being obtrusive and the food was very well presented and of a good quality. I was at first reluctant to fly with this airline but I will willingly fly with them again."

Heathrow – Singapore via Jakarta. Flight ex-Heathrow was a 777-300ER. Online Check In allowed me to select my seat but not to print my boarding pass. Baggage Allowance was a very generous 30kg. On time departure, aircraft appeared to be about 70% full. The seats were reasonably comfortable and leg room was good by economy class standards. Seating configuration was 3-3-3 which is better than offered by many other 777 operators. On demand entertainment system with a reasonable selection of films and music (a good proportion aimed at Asian tastes). The movies weren’t generally as current as some other long haul airlines and the menu system could have organised both movies and music more effectively for ease of navigation but there were enough of both to keep me occupied. Two hot meals served – Dinner and Breakfast – each with two options, Western and Asian. The meals were nothing at all special, standard economy class fodder really, although a printed menu was provided which was a nice touch and there were a couple of hot snack runs between the main meals. Crew were polite and reasonably visible throughout, although some of the cabin announcements were in such heavily accented English that it wasn’t always easy to understand. Connecting flight from Jakarta on a 737-800. Flight time was just 1 hour 20 minutes but impressively there was still a hot meal and full drinks service. Less impressively, I asked a stewardess whether there were any embarkation cards for Singapore but she just looked baffled and said she would be back in a moment. She never returned. Return direct Singapore - London again on a 777-300ER and again with only partly functional online check in. Departure was on time and seating configuration, occupancy, IFE pretty much the same as the outward leg. Once again, two hot meals en-route, although the only option for second meal was fish. The “hot snack” served between meals turned out to be a cold filled roll, and when I asked for a refill of coffee the stewardess seemed genuinely surprised and I was given just a quarter of a cup which turned out to be lukewarm. Garuda’s ‘Hard Product’ is actually pretty good by Economy Class standards, but I get the feeling that service and catering standards have slipped a bit in recent years."

Flight was delayed for nearly an hour due to previous late landing. I was a little bit disappointed as it was an older version of Business Class cabin, but comfortable seats / flat bed overall.

Garuda Indonesia offer a generous 30kg allowance in Economy class and check in online was a breeze. Slightly disappointed by the wait to drop off bags and the staff where not forthcoming with calling people across but this is not down to the airline but their handling agents at Heathrow. Onboard (boarding starting a good 60 mins before departure) we were welcomed warmly by the Purser and Senior Crew. Luckily it wasn't full I'd guess at best a 75% load in Economy (Business was half full and First Class empty) we had three seats to ourselves. Once in the air the IFE kicked in, while not as slick as EK or QR it had an ample selection for the next 15 hours. The crew offered dinner, either a western choice or Indonesian which unfortunately had run out by the time it got to us, the dinner was a bit meh but filled a gap none the less. On collecting trays a second drinks run was offered but the crew where somewhat shocked when I asked for a G&T (why offer Gin in Economy if you have to get the atomic from Business Class) lights out for the next 6 or so hours. Just off the coast of Eastern India Breakfast was offered, this time the Indonesian option was available and it was really good! The lights where dimmed again for the last few hours, however the crew passed around a warm wrap 45 mins before landing which was a nice touch. 35mins late into CGK and a long drive to T2 to clear customs and immigration then back on a bus to T3 to clear Security and go through the Boarding Gate to DPS (I think 90% of the passengers were connecting to the same quick connection flight). Leg room on the connecting A330-300 was just as good as the Boeing 777, however we departed 45mins late to wait for everyone on the late LHR flight. Again a warm meal was on offer from CGK, the main was very good, the desert was not to my liking or many others around. Landed on time into DPS, and our bags were on the belt first and into Taxi 15mins after landing! While the crew may not have the polished look of SQ they do have the warmth of the Indonesian people and I for one am looking forward to my return trip next week!"

The only aspects bringing down the score was the IFE which was rather limited in terms of choice and the ground service.

This was our third flight on Garuda on our Asian holiday flying from Denpasar to Singapore. This was an early morning departure, though this Boeing was showing some age issues and my seat's mechanism was not working very well. The flight attendants were nice, but not as nice as the ones on the previous two flights, we got a choice of three options for breakfast, an omelette, noodles, and French Toast. I choose the latter and it was slightly above average quality. This was not a bad flight, nor was it remarkable.

The only two seats left with them were 38J and 38K. I contacted Garuda customer services by phone, and they said ""Theres nothing we can do"" or ""maybe you did something wrong"". They suggested that I get to the airport early, and at the check in desk, ask for a seat reassignment. I arrived at Terminal 3 Heathrow early, only to be met with chaos and mayhem. After a long wait, I was told that there are no other seats to be moved to. We checked our suitcases in and was told to carry our own suitcases back out the door to a cordoned off area where they were holding the luggage. Everything was fine until literally 5 minutes from boarding the plane when an announcement was made that no suitcases will be on the flight except Business and First class. I spoke to the Garuda lady and told her that my wedding was in 2 days time and she understood my situation and wold make my cases a priority. Next ensued a 13+ hour flight with no sleep because of the awful seats. When we got to Jakarta, we completed a Missing Baggage Claim form, and yet again I told them ""Wedding in 2 days, please mark very urgent"". They did mark as urgent, but this made no difference. Despite numerous phone calls to the Garuda, I wasn't reunited with my luggage until the 5th day of my trip. When I did manage to speak to them, they were totally unhelpful."

In flight entertainment had an unresponsive touchscreen on this flight, and content was of limited quantity as well. On the inbound sector, we had the Boeing Sky interior.

The departure was delayed half an hour but arrived on time on Jakarta. The flight attendants were very friendly when serving us. I received 3 meals, two of which were breakfast and lunch and the other one was a snack. Overall, the food and the snacks were delicious. Staff at Check-In and boarding gates were welcoming and warm. The seat was very comfortable. The IFE content was very good and a lot for short flight but touchscreen had very slow responsive and I think this is the area Garuda has to improve on. Overall, it is always a pleasant flight with Garuda."
✅ Verified Review ,A330,Couple Leisure,Business Class,SYD to DPS,June 2016,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5,yes,9," Sydney to Bali on Garuda Indonesia in Business Class. This was a promo fare and extremely good value for money. The A330 was very new - it still had that new aircraft smell. The business class cabin is configured 1-2-1 across. The seat is well designed and very comfortable with a touch screen control to move the seat to a variety of pre-set positions or adjusted as required. The seat set-up has a separate touch screen controller for the IFE which can additionally be controlled on the touch screen monitor. Due to the fact the aircraft was positioned at a remote gate in Sydney, we had to be bussed to the aircraft which is never a pleasant experience anywhere in the world. The terminal holding area for the bus boarding was full to overflowing with several other flights departing at around the same time – chaotic would be being generous. However, once on board this was all forgotten as we were enveloped with the warm, friendly and professional embrace of the crew. This trip was the first time that I had flown on GA and I did have my reservations, however these were very quickly dispelled. Our crew were attentive without being intrusive, polite and eager to be of service, immaculately presented – a true credit to GA’s training and service standards. On boarding we opted for a pre-take off Champagne (Billecart Salmon) and continued with this post-take off. How could we not have a great flight after such a start? The lunch service was quite simply second to none – streets ahead of QF and CX Business Class and comparable with SQ. It’s fully a la carte (no trolleys ever in the cabin). The glassware is full size not some silly miniature airline imitation of restaurant glassware which was truly a most wonderful surprise. My only comment on the service is that the crew perhaps need to be advised that when pouring wine, less is more. Given that the glasses are quite large, and that 1 in the air is equivalent to 2 on the ground, filling the glass to ¾ full was a bit too much, however I valiantly consumed all that was poured for me. My only criticism is a rather poor selection of English language movies. Given that most airlines these days have on offer hundreds of movies to choose from, I thought the movie selection was quite limited and was thankful that I didn’t have a 24 hour flight to take. I would rate this flight and the GA Business Class product 10 out of 10. If the pricing is right, GA will be my carrier of choice to Europe in the future."

The flight was delayed half an hour but arrived on time.

In flight service was impeccable with superb food and drink offerings including a great Billecart-Salmon NV rose and a De Bortoli botrytis semillon. In-flight entertainment was limited but of good quality, more than enough for the flight duration. The overall experience was first-rate, in particular the seat comfort."

From checking in my luggage, all the way to the premium arrivals service for premium passengers at CGK. Ground crew went over and beyond their call of duty to check in my oversized luggage for me. Third party lounge was okay-ish in terms of service. Flight crew very balanced between professional and warm/friendly, greeted me by name, and very efficient too. The in-flight chef later approached me for feedback, told him everything was superb (it really was), even though he told me the dessert I had ordered was actually not as colourful as he planned it to be, but was fantastic regardless. For the ""Stars"" IFE, it was good to see new films on the list, enough to keep me occupied. The music collection has a variety of genres and artists from many different places, but I'd like to see some more. The Premium Arrivals Service at CGK allowed me to sit down and have some snacks/soft drinks whilst the ground crew retrieved my luggage for me. All the positive experience for a very good price, and I look forward to my next journey with them."

Inflight we got a free newspaper, greetings from cabin crew and music in plane, the music makes me very relax after previous hectic day.

This is the first time I have used the new Garuda direct flight from London Heathrow to Jakarta - the flight itself was very good and it was great to have a direct flight. Check-in was at Terminal 3 of Heathrow in area G which is small, but efficient. The lounge that Garuda uses is the No 1 lounge which is ok, however can get overcrowded. I found the check in and escort through security to be good, however fast track in London Heathrow is not fast track as there are long queues. The flight itself was very good with only a short delay in taking off, which is to be expected at Heathrow. The flight landed in Jakarta close to the schedule arrival time and Garuda ground staff provided great service through immigration and my luggage was with me within 10 minutes of my arrival. Overall the service was very good, but there could be room for improvement in relation to fast track service in Heathrow and in the lounge arrangements."

Check in at LHR was fast and easy. Garuda is based at T3 and uses the No 1 lounge which is just okay, but Garuda passengers are entitled to a free glass of champagne. Boarding was on time but a bit chaotic - everyone was called at the same time and we had push past the long economy queue. The smaller front business class cabin is lovely with plenty of space. I was in 6K which is a single window seat just behind first class. Lots of space and privacy. The food was outstanding on this flight, restaurant quality - there appeared to be 2 chefs on board and they were doing a great job. Eggs freshly made to order for breakfast. The service was very efficient and polite although there was no real attempt at personalisation which was surprising given that the cabin was only half full. The lie-flat bed is comfortable for sleeping. We arrived in Jakarta on time. However, neither the fast track immigration nor the fast track baggage delivery service worked particularly well - bags for Y class passengers were coming off the main carousel before my cases were delivered to the premium baggage desk. They need to look at this. Overall, however, it's a very impressive service and definitely superior to the outbound flight on Malaysian I had 10 days before this flight."

,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Business Class,CGK to AMS via SIN,January 2016,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4,yes,7,"On my last flight with them from CGK to AMS via SIN the ground experience in Jakarta wasn't as stellar as it used to be. You still get the someone who personally takes you from Premium Check-in to the Business Class lounge where you can wait, and sit down as they get your passport stamped. However the Business Class lounge was not only overcrowded, but lacked space to a really bad extent. Several unlucky passengers admitted into the lounge not long before me couldn't find anywhere to sit.  There's the food choice, and I hope this only applies to Amsterdam-bound flights with a Singapore layover and not London-bound flights via Amsterdam. Normally one would be offered 3 different choices between Modern European, Indonesian, and Japanese for the supper and breakfast. For the CGK-SIN sector, we were offered just that for supper. Which was nice. But for breakfast there was only one option of ""Modern International"".  The cabin crew did address business class passengers by name and were delightful and attentive. I will be flying them again especially now that they have announced direct flights from London Heathrow to CGK, just maybe skip the Singapore layover on the return leg. "
,A330-200,Family Leisure,Economy Class,CGK to SUB,February 2016,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,4.0,3,yes,7,"It was a pleasant journey once again with Garuda from Jakarta to Surabaya. This was the second time on their A332 and overall it was good, but there was something that caught my attention - cleanliness. I wasn't surprised by the rather old cabin, but the seat quality was poor. The business class seat panels were scratched, and the economy seat didn't looked much better either and this aircraft has the IFE's earlier version."
,Boeing 777 300ER,Solo Leisure,First Class,CGK to AMS,January 2016,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5,yes,9,Flew again with Garuda on their B777-300 from Jakarta to Amsterdam. The First Class meet and greet service is outstanding both in Jakarta and on arrival in Amsterdam. The service onboard is fabulous in every way. The onboard chef makes an outstanding meal and the cabin crew go out of their way to ensure that they are on hand all the times. Excellent service.
,Boeing 777-300ER,Family Leisure,Economy Class,JED to CGK,January 2016,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"Flew with Garuda Indonesia on a long haul flight with B777-300ER from Jeddah to Jakarta. Departed from JED late evening and most slept after take off. The seats were spacious and comfortable to rest. Early in the morning, just after I woke up cabin crew came to me and served a cup of hot chocolate. The meals were delicious. IFE system responsive with a lot of selection of movies and other entertainment options. A wonderful experience flying with Garuda."
,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,CGK to KNO,January 2016,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,4,yes,8,Jakarta to Medan was my first time with Garuda Indonesia. Check in was fast but staff could smile more. I heard they will soon move to new terminal so I can understand the present economy check in is shabby. Flight attendants was efficient. Food is amazing - only a 2 hour  flight with a delicious economy class breakfast. IFE was also available. I forgot my bag and I came back it was given to me with smile. Thank you. The leg room is so generous and puts United Airlines to shame. Can't wait to try Garuda long haul service.
,CRJ1000,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,UPG to SOQ,January 2016,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,5,yes,10,"Garuda flies the CRJ 1000 on this 2 hour flight from Makassar to Sorong. This is the New Generation version which I love, for it has bigger windows and feels more spacious. The seats in economy class are very comfortable and have plenty leg room. The staff also served a great breakfast soon after departure. Garuda has improved leaps-and-bounds in the last few years. Great to see!"
,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DPS to UPG,January 2016,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,5,yes,10,"Flying with Garuda Indonesia has been a great surprise. On this quick 70 mins flight from Denpasar to Makassar, it was a brand new Boeing 737-800 with the Sky Interior, which gives the cabin such a spacious feel. Each seat has IFE and they served a great lunch box meal. I love it that they make such an effort even on short flights. Well done Garuda!"
,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,CGK to AMS,January 2016,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,9,"My second flight with Garuda. First flight was domestic and I was very satisfied. This time was a long haul flight from Jakarta to Amsterdam. It was again a good choice. Ground staff are nice. Inflight entertainment was really more than satisfactory. Aircraft is clean. Cabin crew dealt with all requests. The small travel bag included useful items. The only thing I can criticise is there were two choices for the breakfast and both included poultry, however this is also partially my mistake because I did not request a special meal. However the dinner was great."
,Boeing 737-800,Business,Business Class,SIN to CGK,January 2016,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"Flew Garuda Indonesia from  Singapore to Jakarta on GA823 07:25am flight, which left on time and arrived in Jakarta on schedule. The service onboard was very good, as was the food. I like the arrivals ground service that Garuda provides for Business and First Class passengers where your baggage is brought to you at the lounge, and then you can go straight through customs. Luggage normally arrives within 5-10 minutes of arrival which is great. Cabin crew on board cannot do enough to help."
,ATR72-600,Business,Economy Class,PKY to PNK,January 2016,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,4.0,4,yes,9,"Palangkaraya to Pontianak with Garuda Indonesia. ATR72-600 was new and clean. Cabin crew on my flights were communicative and attentive as I was seated on front row, I was able to communicate with them. Food box meal that consists of cakes and a bottle of water, selection of hot drinks and juices also offered.  I just wish they could serve hot meals instead of snacks, as the flight duration is around 1h 45m, hence is it enough time to serve hot meals."
,A330,Couple Leisure,Business Class,CGK to ITM,January 2016,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"Red eye flight to Osaka on board Garuda A332, Business Class on New Year's Eve. Check-in is conducted in the Premium Check In area and once finished, we were escorted to the Executive Lounge while the staff took our passports to the Immigration. Nice food offering inside the Lounge. On board, welcome drink was provided and as it was New Year's Eve they gave us hats to celebrate the New Year on board. Seat is comfortable, lie flat with massaging function. Great offerings on the menu including night snack and a choice of breakfast: western, japanese or indonesian. Service is attentive and they always made sure that we were comfortable inflight while not being too obstrusive. Great L'Occitane amenity kit and loved the fleece blanket provided. The 6.5 hours flight went by quickly."
,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,DPS to SIN,January 2016,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,5.0,4,yes,10,"Denpasar to Singapore on Garuda, and a big compliment to all the staff, from check in to boarding and cabin crew. My mom requires a wheelchair assistance whenever we travel and all of the staff took really good care of her. It was our first time traveling with this airlines and we were not disappointed. The staff went all out to make the journey a pleasant, stress free and an enjoyable one.  Very professional! "
,Boeing 737-800,Business,Economy Class,KUL to CGK,January 2016,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,5.0,4,yes,8,"By luck (as it turned out) I was on a Garuda Indonesia flight from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta which was codesharing a Malaysia Airlines flight. By luck I mean that after using Garuda extensively during the early and mid 2000's, it was the first time I had even thought about using them again. It was a great experience. Excellent service with good food and a nice aircraft.  Malaysia Airlines could look no further than Garuda in learning how to turn a brand around."
,Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,CGK to LOP,December 2015,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"Jakarta to Lombok return, the CGK to LOP flight departed late due to runway congestion at CGK. The FAs were exceptionally helpful and friendly. The food and coffee served onboard was delicious - FAs handed out plushies to children as well which I thought was a nice touch. On the way back due to overcrowding at LOP, check in and boarding for GA passengers were prioritized over other airlines which I thought was nice. Flight was comfortable and pleasant on both legs. "
,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,PNK to SUB via CGK,December 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"Supadio to Juanda via Jakarta on Garuda Indonesia. Check in was really smooth at Supadio airport. After arrive at CGK airport, the ground staff help me to catch the SUB flight because I transit in CGK about 0,5 hour transit, so a little bit rush to get to the gate. The ground staff were attentive. Food served onboard was nice. again"
,A330-300,Couple Leisure,Business Class,PER to DPS,January 2016,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"Exceptional service and flight from Perth to Denpasar. This is the first time we have flown with Garuda Indonesia and it won't be the last.  The food, especially the Indonesian dishes were delicious. The choice of wine, although limited, was very good, and the champagne (Billecart-Salmon) one of my favourites. The cabin crew are attentive but not oppressive, and if you do need them they are always happy to help with a smile. As it was a short flight we didn't sleep, however I don't think I would have had a problem. The flat beds seemed very comfortable. The priority baggage worked well at both ends, we received our baggage within the first 3 cases."
,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,First Class,CGK to AMS,December 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"Jakarta to Amsterdam. Booked a pickup service from home which arrived on time. The Garuda Team were waiting for me and my daughter kerbside at the airport. They took all documents and baggage and we were taken directly to the First Class lounge. Approx. 20 minutes prior to departure we were escorted to the plane to board. The service from take off until landing in Amsterdam was outstanding, the cabin crew even attended to my 8 year old daughter needs no matter what she required ie. changing of cloths, food, water etc. The crew was outstanding in every sense. The First Class Cabin Crew on Garuda are a credit to the airline. The Wi-Fi service was onboard was excellent as I was able to catch up on work en-route."
,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,First Class,LGW to CGK via AMS,December 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"Flew from London Gatwick to Jakarta via Amsterdam on Garuda Indonesia with my daughter. The service was excellent, similar to that of our inbound flight on December 20th. The cabin crew are a credit and make you feel special in everyway. They even went out of their way to attend to my daughter. We had a change of crew at Amsterdam, but the service was the same. Arriving at Jakarta we had a team waiting for us to take us to our connecting flight. What an excellent service and the Garuda First Class Team are truly exceptional and worthy of 5 Star rating."
,A330,Couple Leisure,Business Class,PER to DPS,December 2015,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5,yes,8,"Perth to Denpasar on Garuda. Check in service was fantastic. Friendly, helpful and efficient. Lounge in Perth (Garuda uses Qantas lounge in Perth) was luxurious. Good great, seating options plentiful and comfortable, spacious, plenty of beverage options. Restrooms and showers clean and hygienic. Cabin crew efficient and courteous on boarding. Onboard service was fantastic. Plane food was filling and great (for plane food). Champagne was delicious! Ground staff on arrival to Bali were very efficient collecting our luggage and even gave us a cold bottle of water while we waited for our luggage in the business arrival lounge. Check in at Bali was a little bizarre. The counter in much further behind the regular check in and a couple of the Bali airport officials didn't know where the business check in was - strange."
,Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,SUB to DPS,December 2015,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"Surabaya to Denpasar return with Garuda Indonesia. Since we flew during the holiday season, all flights were completely full. Nevertheless, all the staff service on the ground and aboard the aircraft were quick and professional. Outbound and inbound departures and arrivals were on time. Baggage was delivered promptly upon arrival. "
,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,CGK to BKK,November 2015,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,4,yes,9,"This review is based on the three flights I took with Garuda Indonesia. The last was between CGK to DMK while the previous were between CGK to SIN.  I am impressed on improvements within the last few years. The staff and cabin crew spoke fluent English, food is great on those flights, IFE on short haul flights, new airplane and on-time performances. For the last flight CGK-BKK, it was a new Boeing 737-800. Prior taking off we were given a towel and refreshment. The  movie selection was great, the system could get some update for more user friendly experience but overall decent. I did noticed that the return flight to CGK on all flights had better tasting food than the flight away from CGK. The cost per flight is more expensive than some competition. Overall, a fantastic performance and well deserved 5 star rating."
,ATR 72-600 / A330-200,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LBJ to CGK via DPS,December 2015,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,5,yes,9,"The first leg from Komodo Airport to Denpasar was good enough, and the cabin staff are polite and very helpful. The cabin lighting system was good enough (overhead lights turned blue) and combined with comfortable leather seats. Served light refreshments, but they are tasty. The 2nd leg Denpasar to Jakarta was 2 days later, on a spacious A330. Inflight entertainment has a touchscreen, unlike 737. However, they do not have airshow which is disappointing. Meal was very satisfying, but not including an appetiser. Seat was extremely comfortable. The landing was  very quiet and extremely smooth. Will definitely be flying with Garuda Indonesia in the future."
,Boeing 737-800 / ATR 72,Family Leisure,Economy Class,CGK to LBJ via DPS,December 2015,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,5,yes,8,"Jakarta to Labuan Bajo via Denpasar on Christmas day. First leg  was on a Boeing 737-800, not the expected Boeing 777.  Seat is not very comfortable, the meal was so-so. Cabin crew was very polite and with warm smiles - they had trouble at distributing special meals at passengers who had requested them. IFE was deliberately not complete for the 1.5 hour flight, and touchscreen was unresponsive. The 2nd leg was better. It was delayed over an hour due to horrible weather and waiting for a dozen passengers from connecting flights. The plane was colder and had the comfortable leather seats on the ATR. Meal was light snack, good enough for a regional flight like this. No inflight entertainment, but it is also acceptable for a regional flight like this."
,Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Jakarta to Singapore,September 2015,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,5.0,4,yes,9,"Jakarta to Singapore with Garuda Indonesia. Quick check-in, immigration, and straight to the gate.  Nice cabin, the Boeing Sky Interior was awesome.  As it was breakfast time, we were served eggs and sausage or a rice dish with fish. The rice dish was nice, but it could have been better. The IFE system onboard was not that complete as I expected.  The movies found on the IFE was not that complete, but it was only for 1 hour so I did not mind. The cabin crew was so polite and kind, with amazing uniforms, they serve us well. Maybe it's because it's still in the morning, the cabin crew looked so polite, more than the afternoon flights I have taken with Garuda Indonesia. 1 hour passed and we arrived at Singapore. "
,Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,SIN to JOG via CGK,December 2015,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,4,yes,7,"Singapore to Jakarta with Garuda Indonesia and the service was good, we were greeted and offered orange juice as a pre-flight snack. Seat size was average, baggage allowance was generous at 30kg per person. IFE was decent and there were personal screens offering. Blankets and drinks were offered if you asked. There was a rather shabby in flight magazine. Meals were decent. Jakarta-Yogyakarta is a domestic flight, so I wasn't expecting much. Sweets was offered before flight. Snack box consisting a bun, cookies and water was given. Drinks were also offered. IFE consisted of a tv screen shared between 3 rows."
,CRJ1000,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Makassar to Surabaya,July 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"When I first see the small plane I thought it may uncomfortable, but it was very very comfortable flight. Although there is no IFE because short flight and because the plane it's only CRJ100, the seat configuration is 2-2, the legroom was great, the headrest is comfy, and snacks delicious (breads, chocolate, water). Service in the airport smooth and fast, the cabin crew is so nice. However the delayed in UPG is 30 minutes, but it's still great trip with Garuda."
,Boeing 777-300ER,Family Leisure,Economy Class,AMS to SMG via CGK,November 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5,yes,10,"Flown with Garuda Indonesia, Amsterdam to Semarang via Jakarta return for the first time again in 11 years.  Huge change compared to the previous Garuda. Service was impeccable. Very professional cabin crew. On the outbound flight, my mom didn't like the food and asked for the other meal offered during the meal service. Cabin crew politely came to her and gave her the other meal. To my surprise, after the meal service finished, a senior cabin crew came to her and gave her a complaint form to be filled out (because of the meal), but she eventually didn't hand it in. In my opinion, nothing wrong with the food. Perfectly solved problem for such a small issue. They offer such high standard service nowadays, even for the economy class. The suppose to be short layover was a bit unpleasant. 3 hours delay! But they solved it by offering a free lunch at their lounge. There is zero issue on the inbound flight. Flights were on time, great service and again tasty food. Leg room is decent on their 777-300ER (maybe because I am just 5'7""), the domestic connection flight aircraft 737-800 has decent leg room too, plane was kept clean during the whole flight, ticket price is very competitive and nice ground crew service (slightly overweight luggage on both flights but no extra charge) but a bit grumpy luggage man during the check in at SMG (even a fake smile won't harm you, mister). Highly recommended carrier to travel to Asia (and maybe Australia)."
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Jeddah to Jakarta,December 2015,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4,yes,9,"Our last trip with Garuda Indonesia, return Jeddah to Jakarta, both flights exceeded our expectations. The crew were helpful and friendly at all times. The food is good but the portion sizes need to be increased. For sitting comfort, the seat needs to be more flexible and more adjustable in the recline position. We travelled Economy class, but the were spoilt with welcome drinks, good food and great movies. Overall, I will recommend Garuda Indonesia.
"
,Boeing 737,Business,Economy Class,Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur,December 2015,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,5,yes,9,"Flew Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur with Garuda Indonesia. Greeted by the crew with a warm and friendly smile. A variety of newspaper titles were available at the aircraft door. Walked past First Class and was greeted again with more friendly smiles as I made my way to row 27. Top luggage compartments are open and ready for loading baggage. Was happy to find pillows and headphones conveniently placed at the seat. Seats are clean and comfortable with good leg room for economy. The crew served orange juice prior to take off. After take off, food and drink were immediately served. The crew were accommodating on request with refills. I chose beef bolognese pasta for lunch and it tasted surprisingly good however the portions were small. Inflight entertainment is slightly dated with old movies. Not a problem for me as I usually prefer to rest inflight. Overall it was a comfortable and relaxing ride home. I will definitely fly Garuda again."
,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Amsterdam to Jakarta,December 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,"The flight was delayed by about an hour but thankfully it still departed and was not cancelled, this was because of some issues going on with Schiphol. The ground crew was informative and communicative with the passengers. Some of the flight crews had recognised me on my flight in September from CGK to LGW via AMS, and all of the flight crew had greeted me by name. Warm smiles all around and attentive crew, sometimes chatty as well. Food options were great, and I was not left hungry. Seat was comfy and clean. Aircraft seemed new and was spotless clean. The IFE, however, was strange. I think they forgot to update this particular aircraft's (PK-GIA, their first 777) movie contents. I flew with a younger aircraft in their fleet (PK-GIE) at an earlier date and I saw a more extensive list of movies, so hopefully Garuda will update them pretty soon on all of their aircrafts. Upon arrival at the airport in Jakarta, I used the premium arrival service available for First and Business class passengers, and also holders of GarudaMiles Gold and upwards, which is quite unique. Someone will fetch your luggage for you as you can sit down, take a shower, or have some light drinks. I do encourage Garuda to renovate the lounge and make it even more grand if possible. Overall a very nice experience and will definitely fly them again."
,A330,Business,Business Class,SIN to NRT via CGK,November 2015,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,4,yes,8,"Singapore to Narita via Jakarta. After issues with Scoot, I booked a flight from Singapore to Narita with Delta operated by Garuda Indonesia. Check in was almost traumatic since the representative almost refused to check me in because I did not have a confirmed flight to leave Japan (only a waitlisted flight). Luckily I was able to arrange a departing flight with Singapore Air from Narita but was never asked to confirm this with Immigration in Japan. I found the Garuda Indonesia crews on both legs of my flight to be very nice and professional and overall service was nearly comparable to that of Asiana, Singapore Airlines and ANA who I fly with frequently."
,Beoing 737-800NG,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Bali,December 2015,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,5.0,5,yes,7,"Garuda Indonesia from Singapore to Bali. Load was very light, cabin crew welcomed everyone warmly and were friendly throughout the flight. This Boeing 737-800 had a tighter seat pitch than before.  Food was alright, nothing spectacular. Inflight entertainment system had a rather limited selection, but flight is under 3 hours. However, for the price that I paid, it was rather reasonable."
,Boeing 737,Business,Economy Class,BKK to CGK,November 2015,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,3.0,4,yes,8,"Garuda Indonesia for flight BKK-CGK, seat on economy class. We got a cup of orange juice before take off. Inflight served a meal, nice salad and red/white wine are offered. But the meal portion is quiet small. After they meal, they stil offer some soft drinks."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Bali,April 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"Been flying Garuda Indonesia back and forth from Sydney to Bali for 6 times, and never been disappointed. Definitely the best airline, and I'm so proud of my country's airline. Even better than Cathay Pacific in my opinion. Will always use Garuda for my direct Bali to Sydney to Bali route."
,Boeing 777,Business,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Jakarta,November 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5,yes,10,"I have flown Garuda Indonesia twice on the long Amsterdam-Jakarta route in the last months. Their nonstop service is great, and in my opinion the best airline to travel from Europe to Indonesia and back. The seats are the best in economy class. The staff is attentive and customer oriented. Excellent food, good inflight entertainment. Pricing is beyond belief for this great experience."
,A330-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,ICN to DPS,December 2014,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,4.0,4,yes,7,"Seoul to Denpasar Bali was overall happy flight. The crew were kind, there was no problem of verbal communication from the crew with passengers country of departure. Meals also Indonesia style but was the variety of South Korea (trip starting point). One point is that the original Seoul to Denpasar flight that was meant to be an A330-300 was operated by an A330-200, was a little disappointing."
,Boeing 737,Business,Economy Class,JKT to SIN,November 2015,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,5,yes,10,"Service beyond the call of duty. I put my laptop bag into the overhead bin. While taxiing and on lift off a handful of coins fell out of my bag and rolled around the locker making quite a racket. I figured I would retrieve the coins when the plane landed. However the flight attendant came around after the seat belt sign was turned off, stood on the seat frame and picked up all the coins by moving the bags and blankets around - she then handed the coins to me with a smile, and went about her regular duties. I just wished I got the lady's name so that I could write a letter of commendation. Where where else would you get that? The Garuda Indonesia crew are excellent."
,Boeing 777-300ER,Business,Business Class,DPS to LGW via CGK,November 2015,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,3.0,5,yes,10,"Working in Indonesia on a regular basis I choose to fly with Garuda Indonesia from Denpasar via Jakarta to London Gatwick, even though Gatwick is quite inconvenient for me living in Cardiff. I've asked Garuda Indonesia several times if I can join GA089 in Amsterdam from Cardiff on KLM CityHopper services to no avail. Nevertheless, the flight on the Boeing 777-300ER is always comfortable with fantastic service and good food. Seating configuration is 1-2-1 which definitely outshines KLM and Emirates on similar aircraft. Thanks to Garuda Indonesia for offering such a great service - an improvement would be to make this non-stop and direct from LGW to CGK. "
,Boeing 777-300ER,Business,Economy Class,Jakarta to Jeddah,April 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,4.0,4,yes,9,"Jakarta to Jeddah return. I often flew with Garuda Indonesia, but this was my first long haul flight with them. The flight was very comfortable with the large legroom compared to my international flights in 2012 and 2013. The food was very delicious and I never felt hungry during the flight. The flight attendants was very nice and polite. In the economy class, we still got the amenity kit. So, not only from the seat, but the amenity kit could help us sleep well.  One thing that needs to be improved was the IFE. They need to add more movies and make the response so fast. I didn't try the Wi-fi in this flight. I would like fly again with GA."
,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Amsterdam,November 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"The most hospitable and comfort with Garuda Indonesia. The cabin crew are very welcoming and make you feel at home. This was now my 4th flight on this route and will continue to book with Garuda based on price and hospitality, comfort and even the entertainment on such a short route. Never have had a bad word to say. Next flight is coming up in December in business class on the same route. I have done this before and very much look forward to it again."
,Boeing 737-800ER,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,CGK to PKU,November 2015,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,4,yes,9,"I flew with Garuda Indonesia from Jakarta to Pekanburu.  Since I was check in online, I only spent less than 3 minutes from queue until I got my boarding pass. A warm welcome by all flight attendants, and a very clean cabin. The plane is really new and seat is really comfortable. The entertainment system (touch screen) is really good. My last flew with GA was 4 months ago, and entertaniment was very slow reponse, but now is really good, just by soft touch. A whole flight from Jakarta to Pekanbaru was great and very smooth landing. "
,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Amsterdam,October 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,10,"For such a short flight, Garuda Indonesia completely surpassed all my expectations. The economy seat was one of the most spacious and comfortable that I have encountered in my travels and the staff were outstanding with the service they provided. I will be looking to use this airline again on long haul routes in the future as they have won me over."
,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Jakarta to Banjarmasin,October 2015,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,4,yes,7,"Flew Garuda Indonesia from Jakarta to Banjarmasin and the online check-in was rather questionable as I already had boarding pass on hands but they still required printed boarding pass from the counter. There was the delay of 1h30m from 05.45 AM as they must wait the clearance from Banjarmasin airport due to thick haze, hence it was acceptable reason as they prioritize the safety. However they did not announce it with microphone thus making passengers confused when boarding time came. The service for the flight was good, there was only 1 meal option and selection of beverages. Entertainment system and headset are provided for this short flight. Cabin crew did the job well but I did not find them smiley enough. The language proficiency in English must be improved as I hardly understood the announcements during the flight. "
,Boeing 777-300ER,Business,Business Class,LGW to GGK via AMS,October 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,,1.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"Currently on my fifth round trip with Garuda Indonesia and I wouldn't keep coming back if they weren't good. In fact, I find them to offer an overall excellent service in their Business Class where the seating configuration is 1x2x1 and I always request a window seat which is always allocated.  The No.1 Lounge in Gatwick fails to meet my expectations sadly and the Garuda Lounge in Jakarta leaves a lot to be desired in the way of drinks on offer. Late at night when the homeward GA088 departs, food offerings in the lounge can be fairly basic. All of my flights however have been excellent with y friendly and professional crew members. I wish I could join this flight in Amsterdam using the KLM (SkyTeam) CityHopper service but for some strange reason the alliance isn't making my travel easier! I'm looking forward to my homeward flights in three weeks time and will soon be booking the same flights for my January trip here to Jakarta. I'd like to be offered free WiFi as a regular traveller but this is only for First Class passengers sadly. I've regularly flown here with KLM and Emirates but Garuda Indonesia are far better in my opinion."
,A330-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,DPS to CGK,October 2015,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,"Denpasar to Jakarta. Garuda Indonesia outperforms most other airlines from check in to arrival. When we arrived at the airport, several check in counters were opened and even economy passengers did not have to wait for long. Since we had checked in online in advance, we went to the baggage drop off counter, where the staff welcomed us with a friendly smile. Luggage drop off was quick and we were heading to our gate. Boarding was quick and smooth. Cabin staff warmly welcomed us onboard, seats were very comfortable and legroom was superb. Interestingly, Garuda offers a full service product on its domestic flights. Including their IFE, which has a wide selection of movies and games. Unfortunately the system itself is relatively old, meaning the responsiveness of the touch screen and the handheld devise is not up to date and the screen slightly milky. Before departure, the flight attendants offer some candy which is a very nice touch. Shortly after departure lunch service, consisting of a main course (chicken or fish) and a Garuda branded pudding for dessert - plus drinks and coffee. It did not take a long time until we had received our luggage and the Garuda experience had found its end."
,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,First Class,Amsterdam to Jakarta,October 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"I flew Garuda GA Indonesia from Amsterdam to Jakarta on October 12th in First Class and was sitting in Seat 1A. The service from all the way from boarding until getting my luggage in Jakarta was exceptional and the crew onboard were most helpful and smiling. Garuda have an excellent onboard service and the same applies on the ground. I would highly recommend Garuda First Class. Onboard they have 8 seats in First Class and quality of seating, food etc is excellent."

Garuda Indonesia have got their act together offering a very competitive Business Class product. Have flown with them several times over past 18 months. Inflight service hard to fault, meal offerings are terrific and full flat bed on relatively new Boeing 777 aircraft comfortable. Garuda use KLM Business lounge in Amsterdam which is good. Also nice dealing with a real live person at their Melbourne office. This is a plus! There's usually a significant saving on Garuda business class fares compared to others. They're right up with the others and now fly to Amsterdam and the UK (Gatwick). But avoid the night time flight from Jakarta to Amsterdam via Singapore. It's a nightmare and adds a few hours. Fly direct to AMS if possible. Garuda seems to be going places."
,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,SYD to AMS via CGK,May 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,"Sydney to Amsterdam via Jakarta with Garuda Indonesia. Excellent service throughout the flights, and smooth check-in process. One of the best cabin staff service, and flight attendants were very attentive. Had a good sleep on CGK-AMS in excellent new Boeing 777. Excellent choice of meals. Indonesian set menu was the highlight. Unfortunately, GA still does not have online redemption service."
,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Amsterdam to Sydney,October 2015,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,5,yes,7,"Garuda Indonesia from Amsterdam to Sydney via Jakarta on the Boeing 777 was very comfortable. Cabin crew are the biggest stand out for this airline. Checki in was a disaster and chaotic to say the least. I paid money to fly business to be treated with priority which really wasn't catered for at Amsterdam check in. The lounge at Jakarta is atrocious compared to others. Highlight was definitely the lovely staff, truly exceptional."
,Boeing 737-800,Business,Economy Class,Singapore to Jakarta,September 2015,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,4,yes,8,"This was not the first time I have flown with Garuda Indonesia. It was a pleasant journey flying with them from Singapore to Jakarta. The cabin crew were friendly and attentive from the moment you are on board until you leave. The entertainment system was in good working condition and meal was delicious. I would recommend flying with Garuda Indonesia, even on a short-haul flights."
,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Jakarta to Amsterdam,September 2015,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,"I flew Garuda Indonesia GA88 from Jakarta to Amsterdam. It was an 14-hour nonstop flight and the experience was overall beyond expectation. Plane departed on time at 11 pm local time, and arrived in Amsterdam at 8 am, which is 30 minutes ahead on schedule. Cabin crew was attentive, they offered drinks and snack many times. Food was good yet the portion wasn't quite big."
,Boeing 777-300ER,Couple Leisure,First Class,LGW to AMS,September 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,4,yes,9,"We arrived at Gatwick and as we walked up to Garuda Indonesia First class check in area we were approached by a lady holding a tablet with our names on it. This lady proceeded to take over the whole process and soon we were checked in, and escorted through the Premium security  to the No.1 Lounge where a sofa had been reserved for us. She said she would return to take us on board. The lounge was busy and noisy. I ordered some food from the bar and was told it would take 20 minutes, which after 40 minutes still hadn't arrived and yet after I went to inquire, it miraculously appeared. At about 40 minutes before departure our hostess re-appeared and escorted us to the gate. We were handed over to the cabin crew, welcomed and shown our seats. The seats were suites and very comfortable. Pre-departure champagne, warm nuts and a warm towel were the prelude to excellent in flight service, which culminated in a very tasty seared tuna and salad light meal accompanied by a very acceptable French white and another champagne. Descent came too quickly and before long we were disembarking, after a very enjoyable short hop. An excellent Garuda Indonesia experience."
,,Business,Business Class,Perth to Seoul via Bali,September 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,3.0,5,yes,8,"Haven't flown Garuda Indonesia for quite a few years and I was pleasantly surprised. They have lifted their game quite a lot. Perth-Bali leg is only 3.5 hrs long and was a morning flight. Attentive staff and easy flight in comfort. Bali-Seoul was an overnight flight of 7.5 hrs. Nice comfortable lie flat bed and room for me at 187cms. Slept well. Staff were excellent. Not my usual airline, but will happily fly them again, if needed. They do offer very competitive pricing on business class, so no reason not to fly them again."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denpasar to Singapore,September 2015,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,,5.0,5,yes,8,"I only had a short flight from Denpasar to Singapore with Garuda Indonesia but had no issues with them. The staff were polite and friendly, check in was quick and easy, the food was good and the seats were relatively comfy for a short flight. There wasn't much in the way of entertainment (films and TV shows are not available for flights under 3 hours) but they had an interactive map to keep you out of mischief and on a shorter flight you'd not necessarily expect movies. I'd fly with them again, no complaints."
,Boeing 777-300,Business,Economy Class,LGW to AMS,September 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,3.0,5,yes,9,"Tried Garuda Indonesia as an alternative to the regular airlines on this route from Gatwick to Amsterdam. Would not let me check in on line for some reason, but gave me a receipt which I had to queue at the desk to exchange for boarding pass. Defeats the object of on line check in. Flight was fine, a snack and water served. Did not try IFE as only a 45 minute flight. Price was very good, and Garuda Indonesia will be a rival to established carriers on this route. The aircraft continues on to Indonesia."
,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Jakarta to London via AMS,September 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"Garuda Indonesia Boeing 777-300ER has great business class seats with a 1-2-1 layout and direct aisle access. Priority check in and priority immigration in Jakarta.  When I boarded I was offered welcome drinks before takeoff. The plane was clean, and I had booked a good seat. The meal options were very good. Both flight and ground crew were very professional and very warm. There was cabin WiFi with a good speed. I was charged US$21.95 for that which lasted the entire flight. Garuda Indonesia have improved the IFE, but music is definitely far behind. I'd like it more if there were ground staff at AMS to direct to the transit lounge for Business Class passengers."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Jakarta to Surabaya,February 2015,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,3.0,4,yes,8,Top notch service by Garuda Indonesia cabin crew on flight from Jakarta to Surabaya.

,,Business,Economy Class,Denpasar-Bali to Jakarta,September 2015,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2,no,3,"Denpasar to Jakarta with Garuda Indonesia. Tried to check-in online the night before, but since we have an infant with us, I can't do it online. Called the Customer Service to try to reserved seats for us, they told me that for passengers with infant can't check in online, because they've allocated seats automatically by system, so I thought this is great. And today when we try to check-in at the airport, they put us on the back of the plane. I requested a better seats because the Customer Service told me that infant seats are reserved automatically, but in the end there's no such thing. Can't believe they lie to us. Another dissapoinment when it's time to board the plane, usually a 5 star airline will prioritize passengers with infant, but not this time. When I complain, they said that they can't see us, even though I was sitting not far from them. With such lousy service, they are clearly overpriced."
,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DPS to LOM,August 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,9,"After boarding one of Garuda Indonesia's fully kitted Boeings 737, I settled into a comfy emergency exit seat. The safety instruction video plays on the personal screen, and soon we were airborne. Then, as usual, after a few minutes the seat belt light switches off. This is when hilarity ensues: The flight attendants run with their carts through the aisle, tossing delicious and nicely packed snack packages left and right, skillfully in the laps of the surprised passengers. Halfway eating the first (of two) snacks, the captain's voice on the PA system: ""we are starting our descent"". Passengers find this quite funny, as the crew come running again with their carts, collecting the trash from whoever is fast enough to throw it in the cart. ""cabin crew, get ready for landing"". And we did. ""Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Lombok"". The whole thing took about as long as it took you to read this. What an awesome cabin crew, these people get things done."
,Boeing 737-800,Business,Economy Class,DJB to CGK,August 2015,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,2.0,4,yes,6,"DJB-CGK flight was delayed from 8.05 to 9.10 due to haze and later got delayed by 2 hours further without sufficient announcement given to passengers. This very short flight was alright, cabin was clean, cabin crew helpful, the snack was decent. The only thing is that we had to wait and go by bus to reach the terminal, which is a drawback considering it was scorching hot outside."
,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,First Class,Sydney to Amsterdam via Jarkata,August 2015,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,8,"Kind and very attentive staff looked after every need, and delivered a delightful experience. Just 8 first class seats in 1-2-1 layout, each seat converts to screened cabin. Large tv and noise cancelling headsets. Nice balance of programs for different cultures and live cable stations, free WiFi. The seat was prepared as a bed with the addition of a gel mattress, and a feather doona with full size pillows. We had a lovely onboard chef who prepared each meal. Only difficulty I had was the staff ability with precise English language. I might have been better served to have used Google translation to explain my dietary requirements rather than assumed a common understanding of ""vegetarian"". I smile to think about it now but all I was provided with was vegetables, my husband had delicious interesting standard choices and we enjoyed the wine list. Recommend this product for the comfortable bed, sweet staff and pampering on and off the aircraft."

The information given to the passengers was less than sufficient. The permission to board was given after 2 hours of delay, but we still had to wait for more than an hour in the plane while waiting for other passengers to board  (I believe transferred from a later flight due to the delay). IFE was okay, several movies, TV series and music. Inflight snack was decent, with choices of beverage to accompany it. The service of the cabin crew is terrific."

Return flight - overnight - domestic plane, uncomfortable, entertainment system not working, not so friendly staff on flight. Check in staff both ways - excellent. Hard to overall rate this trip - 9 on one way and 4 the other"

Then, we were informed changing the waiting room from F5 to F6, because the aircraft arrived at the different gate. Quite messy, but the information was clear by ground staff. The inflight services were good."

Thanks to online check-in system, I reserved front economy seat. The flight was on-time and smooth. The ground and cabin staff was helpful, friendly with smiles.

I finally had the chance to fly the Boeing 777 that usually Garuda use for international long haul flights. The service was really good from the beginning. I was bringing my bike to Jakarta. Garuda Indonesia has a 23 kg free policy for sportware. Upon checking in, the crew were very helpful, by taking care my bike and even put a fragile sticker on it. Upon boarding it was quite crowded but it went smoothly. The inflight entertainment is really good, they have a wide range of movies, TV shows, music, either international or local. The food is first class. I took the beef rendang. Cabin staff smiled and greeted us and were helpful, helping passengers with cabin luggage. Great service, great food, and great seat."

Check-in and baggage drop off was smooth thanks to the internet check-in system. The waiting room was a little bit crowded and I the seating was not enough for all flights since there were about 3 or 4 flight loads of passengers in the same room. A little bit disappointed that we had to take another bus to reach the aircraft. There is no AVOD at each seat, only overhead one. Departed on-time and overall the flight was very smooth. Flight attendants were very attentive and quick to do their job. The in-flight meal was changed to a mealbox since it was Ramadhan. It contained chicken fried rice and it was delicious. Flight arrived about 20 mins earlier than schedule in Padang. Another disappointment was that when waiting for baggage, ground staff took about 30 mins to deliver baggage. "

This said, the service is great, from check in to arrival. FA's are the best along with Qatar. There is always a meal service in economy, even on a 50 min flight. Service with a smile. Personal TV on each seat. Blankets and pillows also available. Bags arrived in all sectors. Great airline."

GA operates B737-800 for the Domestic flights and A330-300 for the International flights. Three out of four flights departed and landed on time, except the SYD-DPS sector which had to be diverted to SUB due to the closure of Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar which was covered by Volcanic Ash. Even though SYD-DPS had to be diverted to SUB (our hometown), we were unable to end our journey in SUB, but had to fly to DPS since our itinerary was SYD-DPS-SUB. Fortunately, Bali's airport was re-opened about an hour after we landed in SUB, thus we all could fly to Bali. Our flight from DPS-SUB also was delayed by two hours, sadly a piece of our luggage did not arrive in SUB. All Check-in process at three airports was quick. Priority boarding went smoothly. In-flight services were fabulous, FA's were friendly and helpful. Meals were served course by course and were prepared by an On-board Chef."

We were flying with GA 404 on July 22 2015. The ground crew were not able to give us the further information. Fortunately we were able to take off after waiting 7 hours at Lombok airport.

Due to traffic in London we arrived 15 mins before the flight to Jakarta took off, the gates were closed for this flight, but by sheer luck the Garuda Supervisor was still at the desk. We could not thank him enough for his assistance in getting us on our flight back to Australia. We have great faith in this airline and would recommend it to anyone who was thinking of flying Garuda. Excellent airline and the service cannot be faulted."

Was surprised to get a full meal on such a short flight (1 hour 45 min). Staff was friendly and efficient but not sure I understand the 5 Star ranking. We were delayed due to volcano and despite four hours standing in line, Garuda still got us to Jakarta same afternoon, which seemed a small miracle."

Seat pitch and width are very comfortable as the seat in economy was configured 3-3-3 which is good for both short and long haul flights. The beverage and meal service are good considering it is a short flight. The Inflight entertainment system is responsive and power plugs are available.

Service was good and fast - polite cabin crew dressed in traditionally inspired uniform, seats decorated batik style and food was a choice between Indonesian or Western - with plenty of Bintang available. I was lucky and had three seats to myself. Crew didn't take away the spare pillows and blankets so I was left with a comfortable semi bed! Good range of international programming ranging from Chinese to Western to Indonesian on the VOD systems Enjoyable flight with this phoenix of an airline - strange to think it's gone from Indonesia airlines being banned in the EU to a 5 Star rated airline! Sandwiches and crips were available in the galley throughout the flight if you felt peckish - quite a nice touch!"
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LGW to AMS,March 2015,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,5,yes,9,"Short and sweet flight but still high quality service from Garuda. Drink and snack (hot savory pastry and cake with bottle of water) for this 40 minute flight. Only annoyance was that despite the fact I was on the same plane for the AMS-CGK leg I had to get off with everything - only to reboard one hour later back to the same seat. Good introduction to Garuda though, left me keen for the next leg!"

Boarding at Jakarta was organized, old/disabled/family with young children got priority boarding. Entertainment excellent, feature films including some Indonesian titles. Screen a little non sensitive though, the Boeing 737 of Garuda had better touch screen. The downside of the flight was the food.  The lavatory was clean and amenities well stocked. Wifi connection was onboard for a charge of 12 USD. Didn't try it."

,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,SYD to Denpasar,,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,4,no,2,"A month before, our flight GA-713, SYD to Denpasar was diverted to Jakarta instead of Denpasar without reason, there was no connecting flight to Denpasar that day so we were told we'd have to find accommodation in Jakarta at our own expense until the morning flight. Garuda did offer an alternative, they'd pay to put us on a domestic
flight to Melbourne to connect with GA-719 so we took it. The flight was disgraceful, the cabin temp was hot and stuffy and even after multiple complaints by passengers the cabin crew did nothing about it. Service was slow, waiting over 30 minutes for someone to come was appalling, some passenger call lights were on the entire journey
without ever being acknowledged. When the lunch service arrived the food was cold, the so called cold beverages were at room temperature. They ran out of ice 2 hours into the flight. The return flight GA-714 was an overnighter, we were kept at the gate for 20 minutes with no explanation. Being an overnighter most people wanted to sleep, for whatever reason they left the cabin lights on. For reasons beyond any comprehension they had a drinks service at 1am when most passengers were sleeping."

When I asked about the gate for my flight the officers looked confused stiff and uninterested. The sign in front of the boarding room did not even mention when the boarding gate is going to be opened so I had to wait outside. Flight was delayed for a good 30 minutes. The boarding was pretty plain and straightforward. There's this habit of GIA in assigning the passengers on the configuration of 1-0-1 leaving the middle seat empty until there is no aisle and window seats left which is a great thing in my opinion. The cabin crews looked tired. The snack was alright edible stone hard cookie alright bread with chicken filling mineral water and some fruit juice. The IFE was decent unfortunately though there's this buzzing noise every time the cabin crew do an announcement. Overall there is rooms for improvement.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,I flew CGK-KNO last Christmas and returned 2 days past new year. The check in was smooth and quick because of the silver gff check in counter. But in the non-gff counter it was so crowded. The outbound flight was good even though a little bit delayed with attentive crew and a clean interior. Breakfast was ordinary with omelette and fried rice option. The inbound flight was not really delayed around 15-20 minutes late. An old 738 plane with landor livery. But as usual good and friendly crew although interior was a bit old and the lavatory isn't as clean as the newer ones. Overall Garuda is a great choice to fly with.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,GA 331 SUB-CGK on 23rd May 2015. Different from the first leg this flight was extremely enjoyable. The check in was as smooth as melted butter. The boarding and departure was uneventful and on time. The cabin crews were attentive lively and polished. They gave me 2 pieces of bread which were delicious. The flight was practically empty so I had a row for myself I could lean back straighten my legs watching a movie while enjoying a cup of hot tea. Landed smoothly. I booked an economy class but they gave me a first class experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,KUL-CGK-KUL (GA821/818). Flew last April on Economy with the entire family (2 kids and 2 adults). Check-in was brief and smooth. As we boarded the plane we were greeted with friendly smiles by the flight attendants. They were helpful with the kids and carry-on bags. The two kids were given toys (a stuffed animal and a car) which is a rare offerings these days especially on a short haul flight. Seats and catering were very good. We can say the same for the in-flight entertainment cabin ambience and cleanliness. Overall we are pleased with the service and will fly with Garuda again!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,5,Jakarta to Singapore GA 834. The airline has many new aircraft's and their on board service is good. However their on time departure schedule need vast improvement if they claim to be a 5 star airline. I travel often between Singapore-Jakarta or Jakarta-Singapore sector. Most of the time (about 90%) the airline schedule departure time is not met and delayed. Secondly their public announcement in Jakarta airport is poor and unclear. Punctuality reflects how much one care for its valued passengers. Garuda is far behind in maintaining flight punctuality.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew Perth to Bali GA0727 and return GA0728 business class. Couldn't fault the flight left on time everything clean. Entertainment was ok food not bad and very comfortable seating - could lie out flat for a good sleep. Service very good on land and in the air. Used Qantas business class lounge in Perth which was comfortable and in Denpasar used the Garuda lounge which has improved a little still more comfortable than sitting in airport itself.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,LGW-AMS-LGW. Price for the May Day Bank Holiday weekend was fantastic value. A small gripe is that you can't fully check-in online at the moment although seats selected up to 24hr prior to flight are usually honoured upon completing check-in at the airport and I know Garuda are working on this adding the ability to have mobile boarding passes. For now this does mean having to arrive a little early at the airport even if you only have hand baggage and completing check-in manually which is probably more of an issue on this short-hop sector than is likely for a full long-haul flight. Outbound this wasn't such an issue as there wasn't much of a queue but Inbound there was a considerable queue at Schiphol for economy check-in. Check-in staff were very efficient however and warm and friendly. Outbound flight left a little late with a short delayed arrival in Schiphol. Aircraft was an immaculately maintained fairly new 777-300ER in 9 abreast layout with good comfortable seating. The interior was beautifully designed and reflective of Indonesian culture. AVOD was ok although not as comprehensive as on some other carriers. Kept informed by Pilot and announcements in English Indonesian and Dutch. On both sectors Cabin Crew were great and immaculately presented. The crew on the inbound flight were much warmer which I preferred. The slight disappointment was the small snack served with only water which is virtually identical on both sectors. Whilst I don't expect anything on short-haul flights and have flown on low-cost carriers on flights that have cost more and not received anything this is a full service carrier with a 5-star rating and what was served was below the standard I was expecting from a full-service short-haul product. Small gripes aside I would use Garuda again.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,I flew business class from Melbourne to Jakarta and then onto Amsterdam I was a bit concerned prior to boarding as I had no idea what they would be like but the service was great the seats were really comfortable. They really look after you and the price was really good. I would use them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,3,Jakarta (CGK) to Yogyakarta (JOG) and return for a day-trip to see the Borobudur and Prambanan temples. Reserved their first flight leaving CGK at 5.25 am (I was told that Garuda was more reliable than its competitor Lion Air on this route and that the first flight to JOG always departs on time). Check-in went smoothly. Boarding more or less on time (we were bussed to a 737-800 that was not new but in reasonable shape). However instead of going to the runway the plane was driven to what was basically a parking spot. After a prolonged wait an announcement was made for all passengers to collect their carry-on baggage and disembark. I asked a flight attendant for information and she told me that the plane was broken (weather was not a factor). We were then bussed back to the terminal and directed to a lounge which was very basic smoke-filled (over half the passengers there smoked at some point during the wait) and had minimal food offerings. The flight subsequently left a little more than 3 hours late. The return flight that evening was on time. Both flights were less than 1 hour and uneventful otherwise. Check-in personnel and flight attendants were friendly and efficient. My poor evaluation reflects the very late departure of the first flight which significantly impacted my tour that day. No apology was ever offered to the passengers.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,GA 566 CGK-BPP. Orderly boarding pleasant cabin crew and cabin looked fresh too. IFE somewhat slow responding on touch but overall the systems itself working properly. Food was edible. Very good service and flight overall. Keep it up GA!
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,GA837 SIN - CGK / GA828 CGK - SIN. Very pleasant experience. Aircraft is very new and cabin is very clean. Seats are reasonably comfortable and IFE is user friendly as well. Flight attendants greet all passengers with a big genuine smile and has very good service language. Very professional. No wonder Garuda Indonesia is now a 5 Stars Airlines.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,SIN-DPS in business class on B737-800. Extremely satisfying flight to say the least. Only a handful in business cabin service was truly elegant and beyond excellent. Great seats for short few hour flight 2+2 seating compared to 3+3 as in economy. Champagne and wine selection was quite impressive as was the food. Upon arrival in Denpasar business class passengers received private escort by car to terminal. Garuda sure has opted their game in the last years and are impressive.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I travelled from Jakarta to Amsterdam on February 20th and returned to Jakarta from London Gatwick on February 23rd 2015 in First Class on both sectors. The service provided from pick up at home to check in and on board was excellent. The greeting service in Amsterdam while waiting for my connecting flight again was exceptional. I can't wait until my next flight on Garuda First Class. Overall excellent service.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,Perth - Gatwick Jan 17 returning Feb 11 business class. This is a quality service with really good times and connections. The seat to and from Perth-Jakarta is a basic business recliner on the 737. We thought the connection in Jakarta would be tight but it was all fine with no rush or hassle apart from the rude Dutch businessmen going home. The cabin staff handled them well. The 777 ER from Jakarta leaves at 01.00 for a 13-14 hour trip to Schiphol. The cabin setup is excellent with solo window seats alternate couples together in the middle or two seats separated. We were together in the middle. The seats mattresses and bedding were as good as Qatar on the same routes - really comfortable but without the pyjamas. The full flat bed was a bit like the Qatar 787 layout and might be a bit tight for anyone over 180cm. Food and drink is good but anyone with any brain is not flying business for this. Equally the lounges are basic at both Gatwick and Jakarta but very acceptable. Business class is about being able to sleep in a comfortable flat bed. They excel. The connections on the way back are also excellent with a close connection in Jakarta and arrival in Perth at 1930. Garuda have certainly set a new standard for this route. Highly recommended.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,GA 817 20 Feb 2015 KUL-CGK. GA 816 21 Feb 2015 CGK-KUL. 2 hour flight KUL-CGK-KUL good meal crews were always smiley dedicated welcome drink for economy class with a small box of orange juice good entertainment.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,I flew from Sydney - Denpasar return. The flight out was as good as a flight could possibly be (and I've regularly flown Qantas and Singapore business classes). The crew were calm and efficient. Everything was perfect - the food (I chose the Japanese banquet - what a great meal!) seat comfort cleanliness (immaculate toilets with magnifying mirrors - an airline first for me!) amenity kit. The return flight was a little less perfect: departed an hour late (with much confusion re departure gate) make-shift lounge with no alcoholic drinks or much else crew not quite as good. By the time we departed I was starving - I expect most passengers like me would not have had dinner. Crew were focused on taking breakfast orders which was the main meal to served on this fights - 2 hours before landing on a 5 hour flight - doesn't make sense. I was able to get a tasty nasi goring 'snack' and asked them not to wake me until an hour before landing - with coffee and muesli only. Overall I was very impressed with Garuda Business Class and I'm definitely considering flying Garuda Business Class on my next trip to Europe.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew business class on GA 860 4 Feb 2015 with my wife daughter mother and cousin. Check in was smooth as we were using Premium Check in Counter. Business class Lounge at Soekarno Hatta was a bit small since they put First class lounge in the middle of the lounge. Food in the lounge was really not up to standard. On Board Cabin Crew were very attentive and helpful. The Food could be improved some was tasteless. What makes me want to fly Garuda Indonesia again is an excellent Garuda Indonesia experience demonstrated by the Cabin Crew.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,,,3,no,4,We flew on Christmas eve from London Gatwick - Jakarta - Perth. We arrived at the airport with a voicemail from them stating that we may not be able to get on our connecting flight due to stopping in Amsterdam on the way through. The voicemail told us to ask at the desk when we checked in but they had no idea what was going on either. Onto the flight getting on the plane was a disappointment it was old the seats had stains on and me and my family were seated apart and the crew had no interest in helping us. The meals were either over-cooked or cold the entertainment system needed updating with newer films and games etc. We were in the air for Christmas day and although we did not mind doing this there was no Christmas spirit on the flight not even a 'merry Christmas' from the captain when we landed. I understand that Indonesia is not a country which celebrates Christmas but it just would have been nice for them to acknowledge it. There isn't enough legroom for a long haul flight - if someone in front of you has their seat reclined you've got no chance of getting to sleep yourself. On the way back I was told that only 7kg of hand luggage was allowed even though on the way there there hadn't been a problem this resulted in me having to actually move 1.5 kilos out of my hand luggage to someone else's hand luggage that was in my party! What was the point? I was very disappointed with this airline as a whole. I would not fly Garuda Indonesia again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,SYD-CGK on 14/12/2014 and CGK-SYD on 25/01/2015. Both sectors on A330-243 PK-GPP. Outbound plane took off on time inflight service good arrived CGK 10 mins ahead of schedule. Return plane took off 20 mins late but we still arrived on time. Inflight service average they missed one of my son meals. Found the toilet messy on return flight. My seat tray was missing a screw making the table wobbly. Also found Garuda still have playing the same entertainment list for month of Dec and Jan. Guess Garuda needs to buckle up the challenge to maintain 5 star airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,GA342 SUB-DPS is a nice flight good service very comfortable. B737-800NG - the toilet was clean nice facility very friendly crew very comfortable flying.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,I fly with Garuda for my business trip CGK-PVG-CGK. Depart from Jakarta with A330-200 and return with A330-300 it was a nice direct flight. Cabin crew service was very good the meal cabin cleanliness also good. Mobile app check-in is really helpful. The IFE touch screen TV is a bit slow. Looking forward to flying with Garuda again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,When all things go wrong like delays from Perth to Bali and missing my Garuda connection to Lombok I expected extra charges and poor service at the ticket counter. What a lesson in service for other airlines! Garuda organised another flight ASAP with no extra charges. Customer service with a smile. Plenty of seats on plane I asked if I could move to a window seat...no problem. Toilets spotless staff cheerful and friendly food ok seat really comfortable and I am the big model at 110kg. Best of all plane was super clean left on time and arrived early. Pilot was hilarious with Indoenglish. Thanks to Garuda for making my flight so easy especially when they were not obligated. My original ticket was no refund type. Will happily fly Garuda again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,6,Flew LGW-DPS via AMS and CGK on Boxing Day. Delayed 2 hours on way out and also with the stopover at AMS it becomes a very long journey. Plane a pretty new 777-300ER in a 3x3x3 config in economy and it does mean that it feels quite spacious. Lovely crew if somewhat limited on their language skills. The IFE was good for the live TV where we were able to watch live Premier League and also live cricket. Arrived at CGK 2 hours late which meant connecting flight was delayed but they upgraded plane to same one as we arrived on to accommodate the 150 people who had meant to be on earlier flight. All in all a long journey but we knew it would be. Would I travel with them again - yes.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,BTH-CGK. Pleasant journey with a little delay on departure but arrived on schedule. The seat was more than enough for a guy 6ft tall (183cm) and comfortable too. The inflight services were smooth and professional. The food although edible is unimaginative and mediocre. The IFE was packed although the user interface including the directories could've been better. GIA has been dropping their fares since the end of 2013.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I travelled to Perth Australia on the 17th December and returned to the UK on the 11th January. This was the best flight I have been on in many years the staff were excellent so helpful and even helped me with my hand luggage where many other flights will not do this. I would recommend them to anyone.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,We were 2 pax flying CGK-DPS 17 Jan 2015 and DPS-JKT 18 Jan 2015. First leg of the trip was smooth and flawless scheduled on time both for take off and landing had a big wide aircraft (for domestic trip 1.5h journey). No complaints at all. Return flight was almost flawless only minor issue we were delayed 20 mins for boarding (flight Bali to Jakarta runs almost every half hour delays on previous flight might cause continuos effect on the rest) and another an hour inside the aircraft because two passengers was never found in the airport so their baggage needed to be unloaded. Other than that everything went very well. I am GA frequent flyer and up to now am still very pleased with their service.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1,no,1,We arrived to Bali from Ireland without any problems and we were excited for our final flight to Brisbane. A half an hour before we were to board our 11.15 flight we were informed that it was cancelled and we would not be flying until 7 am. Told it was due to bad weather. Some passengers were offered a hotel however passengers in transit had to stay in the lounge. At 5.30 the next morning we made our way to our gate where we waited until 7.30 before being informed that our flight was again cancelled. Again transit passengers had to remain in the airport while other passengers were brought to a hotel. During this time we were asked for our passports so that they could be stamped but when they were returned we were informed that we weren't allowed to leave the airport. Eventually we were told we could go to a hotel to freshen up and we would be brought back to the airport at 5 o clock that evening. 5 came and we were informed that we were delayed an hour and would be picked up at 6. Once we arrived at the airport we were soon told that our flight was again cancelled and we were given lots of different excuses. Some people decided to board other flights to Brisbane via Melbourne and Sydney. We returned to the hotel in the hope of getting on a flight the next morning but as we expected it was cancelled again. At long last we eventually got a new boarding pass and awaited our flight. All passengers waiting for the flight were very unsatisfied with the service and the treatment we received some of us were delayed 52 hours and we did not even receive one simple apology.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,CGK to PDG. I flew this route on 28th of December 2014. The check-in was smooth and nothing special to mention here. The plane on this route was a 738 with a two class configuration. Seats were comfortable and spacious. Food was quickly served after the fasten seatbelt signs had been switched off. As it was an early morning flight a continental breakfast was served. The taste was good as well as quality and quantity. Especially compared to the flights within Europe. IFE screen showing movies as well as music and TV shows available. The touch screen was a bit slow but overall very good entertainment for such a short flight. In general an excellent experience and I am looking forward to many more flights.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I have been well travelled around the globe on many airlines and I must say this was the best experience so far. Melbourne - Denpasar 5th January Business class. The crew were professional but very social also. The food was excellent. Lots of food and of very high standard. A good quality amenity kit was given out. Flight was slightly delayed (1.5 hours) and meal vouchers were given out at the airport. Airlines like Qantas should benchmark against Garuda. Only few negatives the AVOD didn't have much variety (Emirates still the best).
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Garuda Indonesia was not my first choice to travel from Europe to Southeast Asia since it just started its LGW- CGK leg in September 2014 and I really did not know what to expect from this brand new routing. Fortunately everything turned out to be really great. LGW-AMS-CGK was a very long road to travel but the entertainment system that Garuda has made the journey bearable. The food was fine but the portion was a bit small for me. We landed in Jakarta about 45 minutes later than scheduled so that we missed our connecting flight to BKK. The ground staff in Jakarta took care everything for us and got us to the next available flight to BKK and even gave us vouchers for one of the airport lounges so that we could get freshened up before boarding. All in all the crew was brilliant and either on the ground or in the air the service was much better than I had expected. I travel at least once a year to Asia especially to Bali and I think Garuda Indonesia would be the best airline to go if I lived in London.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,2,no,3,When I set out to book our family holiday to Australia Garuda come up as the quickest most direct route. They were also very competitive on their pricing and having read some reviews I thought we had a great deal. Anyway I bought 4 tickets flying from Gatwick airport via Jakarta to Sydney with an initial stopover time in Jakarta of 1 and a half hours meaning our total flight time was going to be around 22 hours. Below are the bullet points of what happened since the time we booked our flight these are the ones I can add. I will definitely not be using Garuda again. Flight time changed 6 times. Actual outbound flight became Gatwick to Amsterdam (had to get off the plane and sit in gate for 1 and a half hours) Amsterdam to Jakarta (now a 10 hour stop over) Jakarta to Sydney. Total flight time increased by 10 hours. Inbound flight took the same form. Sydney to Jakarta Jakarta to Amsterdam Amsterdam to UK. 10 hour stopover in Jakarta and another hour and a half in Amsterdam. So added over 10 hours to the journey. Total time lost for both flights = 20+ hours. Most airlines let you check in 24 hours before –Garuda is 12 hours. Our flight was at 1.10pm on the Saturday so we had to check in at 1.10am (set the alarm). Logged in and they basically gave only 18 seats to choose from out of 150+ seats. What is the point? We ended up having to keep the seats they already had allocated to us as there weren't 4 other seats together so it was a complete waste of time getting up and checking in. On talking to others at the airport they couldn't even login at all! The return leg was better from a flight perspective as we knew what we were in for however we could not even check in online this time. There was no online check in facility available although they didn't say this on the website. We stayed up until 11.30pm to be told we couldn't check in online but had to do this at the airport. Got to the airport 3 hours before the flight and still had to wait over an hour in a check in line. Back to the dark ages of how travel used to be! To sum it up completely messed around with our booking poor check in and website no Garuda officials to be found anywhere in Jakarta. Serious lack of communication around the initial stopover and absolutely nothing regarding non delivery of cases.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,MEL-CGK on 29 Dec. Have been flying this route on regular basis and as usual the standard of Garuda has always been excellent throughout. First time using online check-in system which also working conveniently although for some reason unable to generate and print the boarding pass. The only downside this time was the uncomfortable feeling boarding into a rather hot cabin because the air conditioning was turned off whilst aircraft was parked in tarmac.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,KOE-DPS and DPS-CGK GA443 and GA417 27 December and 29 December GA443 flight using Bombardier CRJ1000 the flight was on-time. The check in was smooth the staff was polite. Overall this is a very pleasant experience. GA417 using Boeing 777-300ER I could hardly fault Garuda at all. Near-impeccable service attentive and polite cabin crew decent food and comfortable seats. But GA417 flight was delayed from 17:55 to 19:40 and 19:40 to 20:40 I'm only disappointed with the long delay but Garuda had already told the delay one day before and the second change was told 2-3 hours before departure.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,GA717 MEL-CGK 13 December 2014. Plane was PK-GPM (A332) and I was immediately impressed the moment I stepped on board. The always-friendly FAs truly went above and beyond in ensuring that the passengers settled into their seats comfortably and our hand-carried luggage are looked after properly. The flight left 20 minutes late due to traffic at MEL but arrived in CGK ahead of schedule. The in-flight food was delicious and IFE was excellent. Overall I enjoyed a superbly pleasant experience flying with GA as always - but as a newly-minted 5 Star Airline who would expect less?
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,7,GA828 Jakarta to Singapore on 1 January 2015. The check in was smooth the staff polite the flight was on-time with the A330-200 was absolutely flawless flight with Garuda. I was impressed by their overall service quality that they had. My only criticisms were the entertainment system could have had more choice of music and films the A330-200 inflight entertainment were old only can select movies songs and games. Nevertheless these issues were minor and I would not hesitate to fly Garuda again.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,MEL to DPS on 18 Dec. This flight was without doubt the best I have ever been fortunate to take. Flight crew were excellent the food was exceptional and just the right portion size. New and well maintained aircraft. I'm a difficult one to please and have been spoilt on QF SQ BA and other carriers in First and Business Class but Garuda is now in a class of their own. Given the competition to DPS with Jetstar and Virgin Australia Garuda is so far ahead but is not that much more in terms of fare cost. I would not hesitate to recommend Garuda.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,PER-DPS-PER. We travelled with my parents in law and our two children in mid November to Bali for a two week holiday. We flew Garuda on both trips and we all really enjoyed it. The crew were very kind and catered to our every need. The food had a average taste but was very filling. Airport lounge at Denpasar and Perth were very luxurious. The entertainment aboard was extremely good especially traveling with children. Overall a very pleasing experience I would definitely fly with them again.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew from Jakarta to London on November 12th and returned on November 21st 2014 London to Jakarta. I found the First Class service to be excellent. All the way from check-in at Jakarta until arrival in London. Ground and on- board crews were without a doubt the best I have come across in the industry and I have flown many airlines in First Class and Grauda have got it right.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,GA88 from Jakarta to Amsterdam. I could hardly fault Garuda at all. Near-impeccable service attentive and polite cabin crew decent food and comfortable seats. My only criticisms were the entertainment system could have had more choice of music and films and it was annoying having to take a bus to the aircraft from the international terminal to the domestic terminal where the aircraft was parked. Nevertheless these issues were minor and I would not hesitate to fly Garuda again.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,30 Oct 14 GA727 Perth to Denpasar. On time. Attentive cabin crew. Good food. Good inflight entertainment. Love the seats. We travel at least twice a year.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,3,no,2,16 Nov 14 GA 0410 Jakarta to Denpasar. To connect to an international business class flight with baggage checked through to Perth. Again with a previous domestic flight the four of us were given seat allocations scattered all over the cabin that is until after a long and tedious discussion with service desk. Boarding control was hopeless. No microphone and people jammed up the entrance to hear the announcements only in Bahasa. A large Indonesian party just walked though without boarding control which lead to delays until head counts finally reconciled passenger numbers. Our usual pet hate again. When is Garuda going to enforce carry on baggage restrictions? Passengers brought excessive number of bags that were so overweight that they could not lift the bags into overhead lockers. Just as well they were some tall and strong Caucasians to stow luggage around the cabin. We have learnt our lesson travelling economy class on internal flights in Indonesia with Garuda is not value for money other low fare airlines could not be worse.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,2,GA716. My wife was due to fly Jakarta-MEL on a Sunday in Mid October. She was advised that her flight was changed to go via Denpasar. We are not complaining about the terrible delays nor the lack of English announcements. What we are complaining about is the totally disgusting state of the toilets onboard before we left Jakarta. Whilst it was economy class there is no reason that the facilities cannot be clean.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,SIN-CGK and CGK-KOE via SUB GA829/448 27 October. The check in was smooth the staff was polite - all flights except Jakarta to Surabaya were on time. Using B737-800NG with great seat comfort and adequate leg room. Aircraft was clean and tidy. Overall this is a very pleasant experience.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,GA448 Surabaya-Kupang business class Oct 24 2014. Being the only passenger in J class I must say I was fully pampered during this flight the FAs were nice and very much care of whatever I needed. The service was the usual top notch business class service even in this domestic route and even beer was served which exceeded my thought because Garuda usually doesn't serve any alcoholic drinks in domestic sector. I got Sky Priority benefits to board the aircraft first and when arriving in Kupang there was one person who specially escorted me to arrival gate. A wonderful experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Great experience onboard flight 718 from Denpasar to Melbourne! The seats were very comfy for economy with plenty of leg room adjustable headrest and pillow and plush blanket. AVOD entertainment system was extensive with plenty of options for the 5.5 hr flight. Staff were professional providing pre take-off juice and amenity pack (socks eyeshades & ear plugs) which was perfect for the a overnight flight. A snack and full selection of beverages were offered shortly after take off and a full breakfast before arrival into Melbourne. Next time I fly to Bali I'll be sure to choose Garuda Indonesia.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew from London (LGW) to Jakarta (CGK) in Seat 6A and really enjoyed my flight. It was via Amsterdam and delays were involved but overall we weren't that late arriving here in Jakarta around midday. The aircraft was clean and all crew were professional and friendly and the meals were exceptionally good. I have an issue with Garuda in that seem unable to sell me a ticket for this flight but originating in Cardiff (CWL) so I could join the long haul sector in Amsterdam. It seems ridiculous that two SkyTeam members can't co-operate better. Even KLM Gold Elite Plus members are denied lounge access in Jakarta but not elsewhere in Indonesia on Garuda economy domestic flights.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Just returned on Flt 89 / 716 Amsterdam-Melbourne with a one day layover in Jakarta. Their Business (Executive) Class product is now up with the very best available in our region and represents excellent value for money. Garuda's in-flight service and menu is very good and nothing is too much trouble. It was good dealing with a real live person at Garuda's Melbourne office who was most helpful. The new 777-300ER's are extremely comfortable with a good selection of IFE programs available. The A330-200 on the return Jakarta-Melb leg whilst not having fully flat beds was comfortable and again the ground and in-flight service was impressive. Our original flight to Amsterdam in August was likewise excellent. Their Amsterdam Business Lounge is combined with KLM providing a good range of food and beverages. The Jakarta lounge is well managed with constant replenishment of food and drinks although alcoholic beverages not available. Garuda 'ticked all the boxes.'
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Flight GA 208 Jakarta to Jogjakarta on the 14th August 2014 and flight GA 317 on the 23rd August from Surabaya to Jakarta. Both flights economy. I was impressed with the service on board both flights. Friendly and service minded cabin attendants. Aircraft was clean and tidy.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,My partner and I flew to Bali recently we have flown with Garuda many times and we travel to Bali every couple of years now. The service is excellent both in economy and Business class. The service is great and the staff are always very helpful. This allows us to have an enjoyable trip my partner is 6 ft 2 in height and he had an comfortable flight. I recommend Garuda.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,SUB-KOE GA448/449 4 Sep-/13 Sep. The check in was smooth the staff was polite both flights were on-time. Using Boeing 737-800NG with great seat comfort and adequate leg room. Overall this is a very pleasant experience.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,5,We flew SYD-DPS-SYD one leg a full cabin the other reasonably full. We knew the aircraft was not new but it was spotless and as new. The crew were engaging attentive and professional - someone always in the cabin. Food and beverage was outstanding and the seats let you have a sound sleep on the overnight return leg. GA certainly deserve their 4 star rating but compared with this standard of quality service some other 4 star airlines pale in comparison and should probably be re-rated.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,4,Flew Business Class Melbourne to Denpasar and returned 2 weeks later (flights GA719 and GA718). Was accompanied by my wife (we are in our sixties) adult daughter and her 2 year old son. Flight out was good - ground staff flight crew food entertainment were excellent. Flight back was the exact opposite - 1) spent too long waiting for a delayed flight in the very poor Garuda Business lounge in Denpasar airport. Massively overcrowded and poor facilities. 2) Gate was changed without notice from one close to where we were to Gate 9 at the other end of the airport. Wasn't even announced in the Bus Lounge. 3) after significant hassle with a pram and a 2 year old we eventually reached the Gate to find boarding had commenced (again no announcement). 4) at the Business lane gave the attendant our documentation. He did process that quickly but immediately let other passengers through (both Business and Economy). We were trying to get the stroller checked into the hold pacify a crying toddler at 11.30 at night and get our hand luggage together. People were allowed to almost trample us! Has to very loudly object in order to get some understanding and a bit of consideration. 5) Flight staff were poor did not circulate for drinks meals were poor. 6) on the overnight flight despite valiant attempts none of us managed to get the seat into a comfortable sleeping position. Never again.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,GA88 17 August 2014. CGK-AMS. Airplane seat food service entertainment the best. VIP lounge in Amsterdam excellent met me with private car near arrival went to special VIP lounge checked in for my next flight there. Only bad moment - when you pay 7000 USD for flight have free transportation to airport 2 butlers to meet and greet you separate lounge and immigration service and finally you have to pay 20 USD airport tax in cash only and if you don't have it you have to find ATM to get this small money. Why can they not include it in the price the ticket or at least inform before flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,1,no,3,GA 571 July 30 2014. I flew from BPN-CGK and it was two hour flight. I was going straight from Jakarta to Hamburg with Emirates. The service that I am not happy with is their baggage allowance and seat comfort. The allowance that I got was 20k while my Emirates flight I got 30k. Garuda Indonesia is supposed to be the flight that people use who are going on a connecting flight to abroad through Jakarta. If they give us only 20k I don't see any difference of Garuda Indonesia and other low-cost domestic flight e.g. Lion Air. The seat was hard and you cannot sleep throughout the flight unless you want your tailbone to hurt for the nest several days.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,3,9 June 2014 I flew to my hometown Padang in business class. It was 30 minutes late from 11.25 to 12.05. I was really disappointed and the rest of the flight was just ok.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Jakarta - Singapore by GA830 on 19 July 14 in economy. Check in took 20 minutes because only one counter out of 3 was manned initially probably due to shift change. New crew came in after 15 minutes and check in was fast thereafter. Flight was on time. Immaculate A-330 aircraft with great seat comfort and adequate leg room. I am a GA frequent flier on domestic routes and was flying an international route after 5 or 6 years. Quick but attentive service on this short route. I had requested Asian vegetarian food and was pleasantly surprised to be served good Indian food that would have done any Indian carrier proud. Overall a very pleasant experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,8 June 2014. I flew Garuda 89 B777-300 ER Amsterdam - Jakarta. It was excellent. FA foods and entertainment top quality.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,4,no,5,Flew on 26th July from Jakarta to Haneda and back to Jakarta on 4th Aug. Flight was delayed for 2 hours from Jakarta due to operational issues and change of plane. Arrived in Tokyo the early in the morning at 1 am. Plane was old and entertainment not up to date. Flight back to Jakarta had to stand in line for almost 1.5 hours as the check-in process was very slow and only 4 Economy counter were opened. Plane was also old.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,3,no,2,We are just finishing a 5 week trip from Sydney to London. While the aircraft flight and on board crew were all fine and the standard comparable to Etihad and Emirates we were extremely disappointed and inconvenienced by Garuda's decision to stop flying direct to London three months after we booked. Garuda would not offer any compensation or upgrade and changed our outward journey to a day later. This was not possible as we had already booked all our U.K. accommodation and so it would have thrown out our whole itinerary. To keep the same dates as per our original booking Garuda sub-contracted part of our journey with Singapore Airlines outward and Etihad homeward which meant in each case two transfers each way. Highly unsatisfactory resulting in hours of waiting around at airports. I will definitely avoid flying with Garuda in the future.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,Bali-Jakarta business. A brand new 777 for a short flight of under 2 hours. Cabin crew were very attentive and helpful and even repaired a button that I caught on the table latch. The meal was nothing special and there was no wine on board only beer.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Garuda Jakarta-AMS return business. A brand new 777 with full flat bed seats. Service by the FAs and the food and wines were all of a very high standard. Flights were boarded early and left on time although we were 30 mins late arriving on the way back. However the big problem in Garuda's new 777 configuration is the there are not enough toilets for the number of seats in business class and for the overnight sectors you can get queues as in economy.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,7,Jakarta-Bali business. A 737 which was adequate for the length of flight. Service by the FAs was of a high standard but no alcohol was served which is marked contrast to Garuda's international sectors.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,6,Brisbane-Bali return business. The problem with this service is that a 737 is too small for a 5-6 hour flight. The seats have good pitch for the size of aircraft but they are very old style. The business cabin was only half full on the way out but full on the ways back. The FAs were very pleasant and really did their best but the equipment was not really up to the job. Only one full meal was served and on the return overnight it turned out to be breakfast. There was no warning of this as the standard pattern for air travel is usually a meal one hour after take off and I had expected dinner. We left at 23.30 were given one small corn tartlet (nothing else) at 00.30 and breakfast at 03.15. The wines with the corn tartlet were however excellent!
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,GA321 SUB-CGK on July 26. What a great chance to have B747-400 on this short one and a half hour hop. FA service is attentive and professional as usual with Garuda the food offered contained only a snack box and no PTV but still manageable on this short trip. Seat pitch is wider than their A333's and load factor seemed very good in Y class. No wonder Garuda deploys this jumbo jet for this leg.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,I flew the newest Garuda 777-300ER in Business from Amsterdam to Jakarta. Long flight (>13hours) but even better as a stopover via the Emirates or Singapore. The newest Garuda business seat is largely comparable (the same seat by 95%) with Etihad and Air Berlin business seats. However Garuda inflight entertainment is much better (incl. on-air broadcasting which gives me the possibility to follow world cup games live during the flight). The seat in general is very comfortable and equipped with all state of the art amenities but too short for people >180cm for a comfortable sleep (But it is a matter of opinion). Service was friendly and the food quite good (three choices Indonesian European and Japanese style). All in all a very good performance of Garuda Indonesia with a very competitive product on the new 777-300ER.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,GA089 Amsterdam - Jakarta. This non stop service is what you could expect: staff efficient discrete and attentive to details. The seat (business and first) is extremely top quality. The amenities are excellent. The short transit in AMS is much more convenient.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,CGK-PLM with Boeing 737-800 in economy class. Good on time performance cheap ticket prices and friendly cabin staff. I enjoyed flight because of the AVOD and the delicious snacks. I will fly with Garuda again.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Waiting to fly from Denpasar to Melbourne travelling business class. Temporary lounge at airport. Not enough seats for passengers. No toilets and had to queue at ladies toilets where there were only 5 toilets for thousands of passengers all leaving around the same time of night. Toilets were dirty no toilet paper no hand towels with overflowing bins. Not impressed at all and not sure any of the staff understood English.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Flying GA818 on July 19 CGK-KUL. Checking in with Garuda still proves to be the most convenient at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. Check-in staff were welcoming and the process was fast. The flight itself was enjoyable with two options of hot meals. I chose chicken with fries and it was okay though portion-wise it's below average. The cabin crews were accommodating and attentive. There was in-flight entertainment but it was very limited probably because it's just a two-hours flight. In addition the flight was with PK-GFN the Garuda's 737-800 with classic livery.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,GA 828 (CGK-SIN) and GA 831 (SIN-CGK) both flights departed on time cabin crews were friendly as usual food on both sectors was delicious but the portions were too small plenty of drink choices. Cabin and toilet were clean. No complaints with the service.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,Jakarta-Jogyakarta-Balikpapan-Surabaya and Denpasar-Jakarta. I salute Garuda inflight staff and at most points the ground staff too. I had great flights and was impressed by the City check in offices. Always a smiling face and attentive in all ways. Red carpet on Bombardier flights and the fact that big cabin baggage was handles with care was impressive too. Food on all domestic flights good.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,AMS-GCK was on airbus with a stop in Abu Dhabi. Crew were very accommodating Return flight was on 777-300 non stop and almost 14 hours. Again very attentive and kind crew. However for the length of the flight meal portions were very small. However there was a chance to get chips and light snacks. Inflight entertainment was good but not what was presented in the magazine. This has been a constant problem with Garuda.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,This was my first time flying GA in their business cabin for the domestic route. GA 164 10 July 2014 I went to my hometown Padang using GA 737-800. No delays. The cabin atmosphere was nice FA's were warm and helpful. They gave 2 options for meals and it was just ok. Luggage handling was done very well.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,GA334 BDO-DPS and GA335 DPS-BDO 2 weeks later. The experience in both flights was very pleasant. I enjoyed the meals and inflight entertainment provided by the airline although the screen and headphone could've been improved for better input and audio. Take off and landing was smooth and there was no delay on both flights.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,GA 89 with commencement of direct flight between CGK-AMS I finally managed to try the brand new B777-300ER in Y class. The hospitality of the cabin crew is excellent and the service has been great. The meals were very nice what I noticed was that they have introduced a new meal tray which is more appealing however the quantity is still a bit small for the 14-hour flight. The entertainment system has been updated and changed to newer system the touch screen is more responsive and selection of movies and songs are relatively new. Seat-wise the seat is comfortable and homely looking but I still do not find it wide enough for some people. Overall I was very impressed with the service and can't wait for their service between CGK-AMS-LGW.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Did two short domestic flight with Garuda Indonesia from Semarang to Denpasar and Denpasar to Jogjakarta. First flight was with Bombardier CRJ-1000 NG was a pleasant flight the aircraft itself beyond my expectation (clean comfortable nice cabin ambience wide window). However there is no inflight entertainment on this flight. (but its fair enough as the flight was just 55 minutes). Second Flight with 6 months old B737 with sky interior and inflight entertainment nice and easy to use entertainment system. Both flights were on-time and provided a snacks and non-alcoholic beverages. Warm welcome from the flight attendant.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,GA207 JOG-CGK. No delays the cabin was clean the FA were friendly the food was nice. One of the issues was the airport itself. The airport was over capacity so it took little bit longer in the check in counter.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,CGK-HKIA-CGK GA860 and GA863 in business class. Overall is fantastic. Priority check in at CGK was very easy all handled by ground staff even until immigration. Brand new A30-200 probably less than a year with flatbed seat. FA's were attentive and communicated well. Compare to SQ or EY IFE at GA was not too interesting but still ok. Food was great with chef on board available. Appetizer and main courses were excellent but the hot brownies dessert was not special. Surprisingly the Gin and Tonic was very good. I consider the service is equal to 5 star airline and definitely will fly Garuda again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,UPG-DPS-UPG UPG-DPS by CRJ 1000 GA-674 DPS-UPG by B737-800NG GA 621. The cabin and lavatory was so clean. Nice AVOD and friendly cabin crew. Fast baggage claim but the snack for domestic flight was small. Would fly Garuda Indonesia again on another time.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew GA364 SUB-KOE transit at Lombok Intl Airport. The Flight was smooth no delay and service foods flight attendants and seats in Economy class were great. Toilet was clean. Will Fly again with Garuda Indonesia.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,I travel frequently to Jakarta on direct flight GA725 at least once every 2 months. Flights are rarely late and attendants are polite and service is good. Very disappointed that direct flight schedules have been cancelled or minimised. Will definitely effect my travel agenda.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,GA 884 (May 15) and GA 885 (May 26) CGK - NRT. Both stints were pretty much on time. Both ground and on board services were excellent. On board immigration service were provided and special baggage claim waiting room for business class travellers.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,2,I was flying GA 236 (May 31) and GA 247 (Jun 1) CGK-SRG vv. Well after many pleasant flight with Garuda this time I am very much disappointed. Both flights were not on time the first was 40 minutes delayed but the return stint was delayed for 3 hours without any proper announcements. I understand that this can happen but it should be handled properly.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,GA 855 SIN-SUB. Service foods flight attendants and seats in Economy class were great. Toilet was very clean. Enjoyed the inflight entertainment very much. Will definitely fly With Garuda Again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Used my Garuda Miles GA 179 from Pekanbaru - Jakarta. Departure on time clean cabin and fast check in as usual. FA's smiled and were helpful. Food was good but small portions. Overall still good for domestic flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Used my Garuda miles flew from Jakarta - Bangkok GA 866 on May 24th 2014. Flight was on time only delay was because of a queue for take off due to traffic on runway of Sukarno Hatta. Flight was smooth welcome drink of orange juice for economy class. Lunch served was nice 2 main courses Rice with Chicken or Beef Potato. FA's always friendly full of smiles. Would fly with Garuda again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,BEJ-BPN-CGK. BEJ-BPN on CRJ 1000 while BPN-CGK on 737-800. Cabin spotless and boarding was fast. FAs very professional and seem to know what they are doing. Transfer in BPN was quick and easy handled by friendly ground staff. They could have been a little more generous on their food quantity.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Jakarta to Singapore Boeing 737800NG and return on A330. Both flights on time. Crews very helpful courteous and attentive. Food was fine but portion wise is pretty small. Entertainment worked well. Toilet and cabin were clean.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,BDO-DPS-BDO last week both flight were superb. Boeing 737-800 with new style of PTV same like on B777 and sky interior. Flight attendants looked exhausted but still full of smile polite and nice service. Food portion a little bit small even tho it is domestic flight. For 2nd leg the aircraft was not newest one but crew were attentive and nice service as usual.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Last week I flew MEL-DPS-MEL. The seats were comfortable with plenty of leg room. The catering was excellent and served in a timely manner throughout the flight. A TV screen in every single seat the movie selection was limited but current and entertaining. I was impressed with Garuda.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,CGK-SIN on Airbus A330-200. 1 hr 40 mins night flight. Effective service good choice of IFEs tasty dietary meal attentive FAs. Would love to fly Garuda again if it is a code-shared flight with any Star Alliance carrier since I want some miles on my card.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Flew with GA 155 BTH-CGK on April 20 2014. Check in fast with very welcome from check in counter in Batam airport on time departure. What a nice and great service with FA's always smiling and kept checking to make sure everything was ok.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Another nice flight with Garuda from CGK-PKU with GA 178 on April 20. Great foods friendly and nice FA's smooth take off and landed and on time. The airplane was new and very clean.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,GA 421 DPS-CGK flight using B773 due to long weekend but in fact for DPS to CGK filled only half of full capacity. Flight was late about 35minutes the ground staffs informed that flight from Jakarta was late due to bad weather (heavy rain). Staff greeted us with big smiles when we boarded. Cabin looked clean and well maintained. IFE was very interesting easy to use and provided many good movies and games. Overall a good experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,GA189 KNO-CGK on 31 March. Flight operated by 737-800NG with registration number PK-GFR. This aircraft already had the sky interior onboard. Flight attendants were nice and friendly and greeted the passenger with traditional salam garuda. After takeoff there was a hot meal service for this 2 hours journey. The meal had 2 choices: Beef Rendang with rice or Fried Fish with rice. I choose beef and it was tasty. After the meal service the FA distributed an ice cream for dessert. This aircraft had PTV AVOD with decent movies short films music and games. Will fly with Garuda again.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,SYD-CGK-SYD Dec 2013. First experience flying Business/Executive class. Express check-ins and custom and immigration clearances in both SYD and CGK. Excellent service and the flight attendants were very courteous and helpful. The foods were very good especially the Indonesian choice. Quite a good range of wines. I managed to taste all 3 red wines. The seat/flatbed was very comfortable. Surprisingly the old version A330-200 (CGK-SYD) I found more comfortable. Did not watch the IFE on CGK-SYD slept most of the times. But generally I found not many new releases. The only downside is the frequent flyer programme they have which I found very difficult to redeem (manual process etc.).
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Domestic flight with their brand new B738 from Jakarta to Semarang vv. They provided snacks for the 45 minutes flight consisting of bread small sweet and choices of drinks. Nothing to complain about they have personal AVOD but I didn't use it as the flight was just 45 minutes.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,Flew GA 0434 from Lombok to Pekanbaru stop over in Jakarta. On time departure smooth airplane clean and nice foods as always and what a wonderful service from FA and also ground staff.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,"Brisbane-Denpasar on flight GA721 on 7 March 2014. Aircraft was a new 737-800NG plenty of leg room and as the outbound flight was only half full it was very comfortable. The crew were polite and respectable and nothing was a problem. Plenty of alcoholic drinks. Lunch served was a full meal and the cutlery was stainless steel and not plastic. Return flight GA720 Denpasar-Brisbane on 28 March 2014. Happy crew again polite and every remark was ""yes sir"" or ""no sir"". Meal was a full breakfast 3 hours into the flight. Both flights departed on time and both cases arrived early."
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,Flew GA0177 PKU-CGK 24 March 2014. Service was great Food was great for domestic economy class. Very comfortable seat and clean great service from Cabin crew. Hopefully Garuda will fly back to Germany.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,GA 425 CGK-DPS. Service foods flight attendants and seats in Economy class were great. Will fly with Garuda again for sure.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,8,GA 185 KNO-CGK. Very satisfied with the service the flight attendant was very friendly and the flight was on time. The pilot kept us informed of any bad weather we passed during the flight. IFE very good. The food was very good with plenty of choice.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,SYD-DPS-SYD Business Class. Access to the Qantas Club lounge at Sydney airport was great. The A330-200 is a great business product. Very comfortable seats amazingly good legroom and seat width. Great meals inflight but they did run out of choices which is very disappointing when you pay Executive fares. Offered drinks many times during the flight and anything requested was always delivered quickly and with a smile. Same on return leg. The only negative was on arrival the attendants did not restrain Economy passengers from entering the business cabin - therefore it was quite exhausting trying to disembark and then be ferried by overcrowded buses to the terminal.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,5,Inboard business class service is very good with a good choice of meals if you want a drink you should be prepared to ask several times. Onboard crew know nothing about ground services at all. Despite double checking with call centre on arrival from transit resulted in an additional visa on arrival USD 25.00. Bus to connecting flight pay yet more tax. Go through immigration and advised cannot take water into departure lounge. This only happens Jakarta to Singapore. Get hotel to print out boarding pass for departure to Australia get to the airport and told you need another boarding pass. Business class lounge very basic yes I know they are doing renovations but they are also doing the same renovations in Denpasar so again very basic and don't even think of asking for a drink. Transfer from Jakarta to Denpasar not my request but the only flight on this day. Dropped off at the Domestic Arrival and told to find own way to International approx 15 minutes walk. Off to immigration but told you must pay more tax so far the cost of the tickets has risen by over USD 100.00 just to transit. Not all problems are Garuda's taxes are government but passengers must be fully informed. Transit passengers should be assisted not abandoned. If a Garuda is serious about creating a better reputation it must address information services and passenger assistance.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,2,GA319 SUB-CGK 27 Jan 2014. With the service and facility that they have I think the price is quite high. The service is no good and not friendly at all. Entertainment facility is very limited and due to the sound I couldn't really hear clearly. The food is awful I ordered a special meal and when I got the meal it was already spoiled.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,I boarded my overnight Bali - Tokyo flight on a Garuda A330-300 expecting not much. I was in for a very pleasant surprise. The plane was brand new with flatbeds which I was not expecting. Although the seat was a little bit narrow with not much storage space I still managed to have a decent sleep. The IFE had a good selection of movies and was relatively easy to use. Service came with a wonderful smile and warm Indonesian hospitality. It is obvious that recently Garuda has been investing a lot into hardware and it shows. There are still small details that can be improved upon such as a fluffier pillow and non-synthetic blanket however this is a very competitive product.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,A330-300 from Amsterdam and return (GA 88-89 respectively). The flight had a short transit in AUH which for me was pretty cumbersome and tiring to get out of the plane after several hours in the aircraft. Fortunately the service was great the selection of meals were unique as they combined western and Indonesian menu. The cabin crew were responsive and professional in a way of treating and comforting passengers but the entertainment system was pretty disappointing. The movies were limited and the touch screen was not really responsive. I really wish to fly their brand new B777-300ER soon when they launch direct flight from CGK-AMS.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,GA 0416-GA 0720 on 14th Feb GA 0721-GA 0439 on 1st March destination CGK-DPS-BNE (return). I traveled with my 2 sons parked the stroller before we entered the flight but when we transited in Bali the flight attendants said I needed to get the stroller at baggage claim. Carrying one boy in one hand with a cabin bag and another boy was not easy! I was informed by check-in staff that we would be served a kids meal but later on flight attendants said they didn't have any. No toys or enough inflight entertainment available for kids either. Although I am a gold frequent flyer and flying all the time with Garuda for business purposes I will not recommend it for those travelling with kids.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,GA716 9th March. Excellent flight in a well maintained A330. My main reason for commenting was the excellent service provided by the priority lounge staff and manager at Jakarta airport who helped out in retrieving stuff I had left at my hotel. Nothing was too much trouble.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,GA 884 CGK-NRT. The immigration was fast clean cabin nice lounge nice in-flight entertainment very comfortable seats. Staff were friendly they have a limousine for first class passengers and the food offered was tasty. The price was reasonable.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,yes,3,GA299 BKS-CGK. I took the morning flight because I will continue my trip to another city in Indonesia the flight was scheduled at 7.25 am but the fact was the aircraft arrived from CGK at 7.30 am so the flight was delayed about 30 minutes. Fortunately the cabin crews apologized about the delay and served the passengers friendly. Another problem I found when the arrival even though the aircraft landed smoothly the aircraft parked in the remote area and we need to go to the Arrival terminal by bus that provided by them. Actually it would be ok if the weather was good but in the condition of heavy rain like I did it wasn't supposed to be parked in the remote area.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,GA718 DPS-MEL 24/2 in business. A330-300 with same immaculate cabin and seats as 200 on way up. Check in efficient. Lounge is temporary so pretty basic with partition from main terminal but still better than the main terminal for waiting but certainly not worth arriving early to enjoy especially with constant announcements. Didn't eat or drink in lounge so no comment. Crew warm and gracious and requests met quickly. Slept the whole flight so can't comment on IFE or food except to say when I woke a crew immediately offered hot or cold drink. Toilets spotless. Flight on time priority bags first and second on belt without delay. For the bargain price paid it was exceptional value and will definitely consider and recommend Garuda for future travel.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,GA719 MEL-DPS 17/2/14. Flight empty with only 6 of 36 in business. Check in took minutes with no other passengers waiting. Qantas Business lounge in Melbourne great place to relax with good breakfast selection. Flight departed right on schedule and arrived 30 minutes early. On board service was extremely attentive. Amenity kit contained useful items. Food was just OK with lunch served and chips chocolates and cup noodles offered throughout the flight as snacks. Toilets spotless. Good entertainment selection. Very comfortable seat not quite horizontal but by far the best option out of the three airlines plying this route and although an early start from Melbourne we checked into our Ubud hotel at 2pm so it really gives you that extra bit of time to enjoy Bali. No on board immigration on ex Melbourne flights. Also our preferred seats were marked as occupied during on line check in and were empty so if you don't get the seat you prefer try asking at check in for them. In summary great seat and service good IFE OK food and wine best option for this route in business class and definitely recommend.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,5,yes,7,GA 721 then GA 439 BNE-DPS-CGK. Flying back 11 days later on GA 400 then GA 720 CGK-DPS-BNE all on B737-800NG. In every aspect the experience couldn't be more than four stars. Smooth check-in at Brisbane Airport with my bag tagged all the way for Jakarta but it had to be picked up at Denpasar for customs clearance then dropped off at their domestic terminal. Garuda uses their narrow-body fleet on this 5hrs flight meaning that it cannot fly on full load you are guaranteed more space to stretch out in economy. The cabin and toilets were immaculately clean and the seat pitch exceeded expectations. You are served a drink before take-off. The service from the cabin crew seemed rushed however and I feel there should be improvements with their English. Meals served on board were plentiful you'll even get a three-course meal on the 1hr45mn DPS-CGK flight. My only tip with Garuda is to pack your own IFE as their options may not be to everyone's taste and they are prone to glitches. Another thing is to bring your own headphones because the ones provided by Garuda had poor sound quality you couldn't hear anything over the engines and unfortunately this was a consistent problem on all of the four flights that I took with Garuda.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew from SYD-CGK (GA713) CGK-PDG (GA162) PDG-CGK (GA163) CGK-SYD (GA 712). For international flights we got offered either orange juices or apple juices. The meal was really tasty! We also received a light meal (ie. small bread) and an ice cream at the beginning of the flight and just before the captain commencing the descend. As for the domestic on one of my flight from PDG-CGK we even got free in-flight entertainment (I never found any free in-flight entertainment during other domestic flights). The other highlights are: the immigration on board from Sydney the spacious legroom the extra baggage allowance (we got 30kg whilst most of the other airline only allow us to carry 23kg) the very friendly flight attendants a lot of new movies on their in-flight entertainment 24/7 customer services (in Indonesia) and the on-time flight schedule.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,SIN-CGK GA829 on Feb 11th. A smooth flight operated by 737-800NG with comfortable seats nice and smiling crew members and on time departure and arrival. Price was 50% lower than SQ and this is why I chose Garuda. On the minus side: they ran out of chicken when they got to my row so I did not have lunch (I cannot eat seafood): the hostess was very apologetic and try to get me something else even though at the end it was not possible but I did not starve during a 1.5 hr trip. In Jakarta the plane was parked at a remote stand forcing us to have a rather long bus ride. On the plus side: check-in at Changi was a breeze as was going through immigration and customs in Soekarno-Hatta and seat pitch and softness is above average for economy. I have to mention that I had troubles when trying to buy the ticket in their website as the page got frozen when processing the payment: and after trying several times I had to give up and purchase it through an agency at a higher price. Anyway considering the level of service and the value for money I will probably consider to fly with them again in the future.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,I was flew DPS-CGK return. GA 425 (DPS-CGK) January 30 with Boeing 737-800 and GA 416 (CGK-DPS) February 4 with Airbus A330-300. There was no delay and the in-flight meals are not too special but the stewardesses was very friendly to passengers. For the entertainment touch screen not sensitive and I hope the entertainment can be improved to make the operation of IFE easy.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,Just returned from GA713 to SYD to CGT - and GA 714 DPS-SYD a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Couldn't fault anything- comfortable flat bed set- excellent food and wine and very friendly cabin crew. Garuda's business class product is now amongst the best. The wines were especially good and service and presentation excellent. Entertainment is a little bit limited compared to some other airlines but still had some good movies/programs.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,JOG-CGK. GA217. Early boarding brand new aircraft with Boeing sky interior comfortable seat and large seat pitch. Friendly FA and the food and beverages weren't bad. Landing on-time at CGK. But sat about 35mins. On the aircraft due to crowded airport. Overall the flight was excellent but very disappointing airport.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,3,no,3,GA89 AMS-AUH-CGK: No online check-in possible in Netherlands resulting in bad seats. When drinks were served we asked for a red wine which was not possible they said only served with meals. IFE missing Flight Info channel. Overall performance mediocre to bad. GA88 CGK-AUH-AMS: 65 mins delay - arriving at AUH we were told to stay in aircraft during cleanup and refuelling sat for 90 mins in parked aircraft while there was time enough to get out and stretch legs. Same wine problem as in GA89 but wine was served during breakfast. Never again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,CGK-NRT-CGK on their new Boeing 777-300ER outbound to Tokyo on a red-eye flight comfy seat with adequate pitch improved AVOD with more movies selections breakfast is served prior to landing service is good and able to catch some sleep during the flight. Inflight wifi is available and live tv option on the iFE. Flight arrived earlier than scheduled in Narita. Outbound flight leaves Narita at 12 noon welcome drink is now Evian water no longer Juices snacks and continuous drink service is served prior to lunch lunch has western and Japanese option ice cream is served 1 hour before landing for in between meal full flight service is excellent FA's friendly and cheerful flight landed on time and really liked their on board immigration process thus its a breeze upon arriving at Jakarta airport as we do not have to queue for immigration.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,2,On Saturday October 12th 2013 we arrived 3 hours before our planned departure to Hong Kong on GA860 only to be told that the plane was delayed however they did not say that it would be 6+ hours delay. Check in was chaotic to say the least and customer service could not be found. After 1 hour we were allowed to check in so we proceeded to temporary lounge which was over flowing with people and nowhere to sit. Tried to follow up with Garuda Customer service department upon our return to Jakarta however that is a challenge in itself.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,GA884 CGK-NRT 24 December 2013. Check in at Terminal 2 Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (CGK). I didn't have to queue up for check in because I use GFF Gold Card and I get a lounge invitation for Garuda Indonesia Executive Lounge. I didn't have to queue up for the immigration - great plus. Boarding and pushback on time. Take off and landing on time.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,GA878 CGK-ICN 4 Jan 2014. The check-in at CGK airport was seamless. We didnt have to queue up for the immigration - a great plus. The Business class lounge is dreadful. In fact it was nicer at the gate lounge where the air was fresher. The F&B at the lounge was very disappointing. I think GA really needs to work on this in order to be able to compete with other 5 stars airlines. Flight delayed the boarding process was appalling. There is no C class dedicated line. I understand CGK airport is very congested but we were made to wait for transport bus for more than 15mins. There were no staff. I thought as C class passengers you will receive a better service in this area. Once we were on board the service seems to be a lot better. Credit to all the cabin crews. The CSM doesn't seem to do much at all. Onboard Food presentation is superb however it didn't feel as fresh as it could possibly be. Entertainment is very limited but being a night flight we didn't really use it. I also noticed the flight path program which i personally like was not available. Seat is comfortable and I slept. A nice touch when I discovered a crew had placed a blanket over me when I woke up. Breakfast was good. Flight landed smoothly at ICN. Overall it is a good flight and I look forward to experience GA service again in the near future.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,GA 224 from Jakarta to Solo on 27 December 2013. During the flight there were no problems. Flight was on time. Flight attendants very kind. The inflight entertainment was great. The seat was clean. I will fly Garuda Indonesia again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,yes,10,GA368 SUB-SRG on Jan 7 2014. Although using Bombardier CRJ1000 and only 45 minutes flight Garuda Indonesia successfully managed to deliver service as pleasant as in Boeing 737-800 flights from Surabaya. Good cabin ambience in small aircraft. No PTVs but still got a complimentary snack. I am hoping that this route should be operated with larger aircraft soon because it is not easy to get cheap fares in full capacity routes like SUB-SRG.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,,,3,no,3,GA0324 on 22nd Dec 2013 CGK-SUB flight was delayed for 2 hours due to traffic. No refreshment (at least water) served inside the terminal. We even stayed inside the aircraft for more than 30 minutes before departing. A woman carried her crying baby was still walking around trying to calm the baby down while the aircraft was moving and seatbelt sign was already on. CA didn't warn her to sit down. The entertainment didn't work. GA0323 on 3rd Jan 2014 also delayed approx. 1.5 hours. Isn't it probably better to rearrange the schedule and fly on time? Fortunately I had 6 hours before flying to Doha.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,GA326 CGK-SUB using Boeing 737-800 on Dec 22 2013. The flight departed an hour late due to busy airport operations. Fortunately Garuda Indonesia provided complimentary welcome drinks while waiting for the departure. Cabin ambience is as great as usual however Garuda Indonesia needs more updated AVOD contents in all of its Boeing 737-800 aircraft's. Surprisingly Garuda Indonesia arrived earlier than expected at SUB. I am hoping to fly again soon with Garuda Indonesia and still waiting for its Airbus A330 to operate on this route.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,GA717 MEL-CGK 18 Dec 2013. Flew on one of GA's newer A332s (PK-GPO) and I must honestly say that their new-and- improved Economy Class interior is really impressive. Great IFE clean cabin the FAs were very friendly and attentive. Unfortunately as it was a full flight and I was seated at one of the last rows when the food cart reached my area the FAs had run out of meal choices - my meal was quite tasty nonetheless. Overall an excellent experience as per usual.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,3,yes,10,Flew on Domestic route DPS-SUB-BPN DPS-SUB with their old unique livery on young B738 SUB-BPN with their CRJ1000NG. Honestly really enjoy the CRJ flight very smooth flight. But FA's very friendly as usual. Flight on time even it's connecting. Both cabin are clean very tasty snack choice with sandwich cake and also many choices of drink. I will fly with them again.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew Sydney to Bali return on Garuda's A330. Business class passengers use the Qantas lounge at Sydney Airport - great food and plenty of seating even during the morning rush. Unfortunately the flight was delayed 7 hours due to mechanical issues but the ground staff handled it pretty well. The flight itself - food was of high quality (and lots of it) service attentive and friendly seats comfortable (180 degree lie flat) entertainment fairly decent. On-board immigration was a great plus. Overall a solid business class product that beats all other competitors on that route (in terms of value and quality).
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew Jakarta - Perth VV. Onboard B737-800 service was impeccable cabin crew all were so nice and hospitable clean cabin during the flight and arrived in time. the economy seat on Garuda was just really comfortable. Definitely will fly them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,SIN-DPS. The flight and the service was above all my expectations. Clean Boeing 737-800 great friendly service. Left and arrived on time.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Great flight on brand new aircraft from Sydney to Denpasar. Good IFE at every seat meals served at sensible times. Service was professional. Couldn't have asked for more for the price. Would definitely fly them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,DPS-HKG with 737-800. With very comfortable cabin and seat with pillow and blanket. IFE also installed in every seat. The staff is very friendly food is also very delicious. Valuable flight and recommend to everyone.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,HKG - CGK on A330. Good check in service quick and easy In HK airport they use China Airlines lounge which is basic but comfortable. On board wide angled lie flat seat very comfortable with excellent cabin service 3 choices of menu snacks etc. Arrive at Jakarta airport luggage first out fast track immigration. Out of the terminal in less than 30 mins. A great experience all at a very reasonable price as it's part of my free stopover on my way to Australia.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,CGK-PER on 737-800. Excellent premium check in service at Jakarta they take care of everything including immigration formalities while you are sat comfortably. Personally escorted to the temporary lounge as their new lounge is being renovated and expanded. Being the only passenger on board C class I was pampered by the purser and one crew non stop drink top up and lunch at my preferred hour etc. The experience is slightly marred by the cradle seat however still fairly comfortable for a medium haul flight to Perth. Ticket costs only slightly more than full fare economy on some other airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,1,GA 412 November 11 was scheduled to depart Jakarta at 1700. Around 1655 there was an announcement at the gate (F2) that 'due to operational reasons' the flight would depart from F7. A little after 1700 we were bused to the aircraft & the door eventually closed at 1742. 42 minutes after the scheduled departure time. Neither at the gate nor on-board was there an announcement telling us why the flight was late. Is Around 1800 the pilot advised that we would not depart until around 1900 (2 hours after the scheduled departure time) due to airport traffic. If Garuda had been able to board the aircraft and close the doors on-time we may not have had to wait 2 hours! Why is Garuda incapable of keeping passengers informed?
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,The flights we made were above our expectations. The ground staff were friendly staff on board were extremely friendly the flights were on time. The aircraft was new and in excellent condition. Service onboard was excellent and the food on domestic flights was like the good old days in Europe. We flew economy and the leg room was excellent!
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew TPE-CGK on Garuda was supposed to fly on July 13th instead was moved to July 14th due to typhoon. The food was good the inflight entertainment was good though there's still room from improvement. The food was good had some grilled fish for breakfast. Seat was better than SQ's. I'm stunned with the improvement and will definitely fly with Garuda again but on Executive Class maybe.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,SRG-CGK-BKK all flights were on time. I flew Economy Class on SRG-CGK and Executive Class on CGK-BKK. I couldn't check in for my second flight in SRG so did on arrival in CGK at the Premium Check In Area where they assisted me immediately. They printed the boarding pass and gave me a Fast Track Card for immigration in Bangkok. Was escorted to the Executive class lounge (I didn't pass through immigration). On arrival in the lounge she went to get the immigration stamp for me. The Executive lounge was little bit disappointing but I accepted it because they are renovating their lounge. After boarding the aircraft they quickly offered refreshments and I had 3 choices of meal.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Jakarta - Kupang via Denpasar. Both flights in Executive class. The service was good very nice crew yet very intimate. The food was just ok but the dessert was great. I also tried the new executive class on B777 very nice seat new entertainment which was good.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,JOG inbound to CGK poor inflight refreshment (snack box) with only 1 cheese Danish plus very small mineral water with the brand new snack box they should have more snacks inside - very poor for the short ride. If I recall back before 2009 they still served an old fashioned snack box with variety of Indonesian food items. Flew 15 October 2013 in economy class.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,6,CGK - Abu Dhabi. Quick check in but we departed 90 minutes late. I was concerned that I would miss my connecting flight in Abu Dhabi (codeshare on Etihad) The stewardess told me it would all be fine and not to worry . Onboard service was satisfactory; reasonable IFE decent food etc. etc. On arrival at Abu Dhabi I rushed to the connecting flight gate but it had already departed. Was rerouted onto Qatar Airways. Overall Qatar was significantly better than Garuda. The difference between a 4 star and a 5 star airline I guess.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,CGK to PLY pleased with the service. Without delays and had good take-offs and landing. Inflight entertainment was good but could be better. Comfortable seat if compared to other airlines economy class. Price could be cheaper but not too expensive for service like that. The food was delicious for plane food.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Abu Dhabi to Jakarta and back in August/September 2013. Good food good service both times without any delays no queues upon check-in good-looking cabin smooth flight and everything. I would definitely fly Garuda again and I'll recommend it for sure to anybody traveling on the same route.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,CGK-ICN on 30th July 2013 and ICN-CGK 3 weeks later. Both in first class. Both flights were on time. The staff were very nice and helpful to the customer needs. The food was not the best but still acceptable. The seats are great. Overall I had a great experience using this airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,My family and I used GA for CGK-HKG-CGK 26-31 August 2013. FA's were very helpful and polite with our 2 children. Immaculate cabin. On time. Improvements needed for inflight entertainment. Generally excellent service.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,SUB-CGK on GA309 yesterday. Surprisingly Garuda Indonesia used Airbus A330-200 aircraft to operate this route. Cabin crews were pleasant as always in-flight meal is equal with the flight time provided but in-flight entertainment needs to be updated with new movies and music. Hope to fly Garuda Indonesia again for SUB-SIN service next month.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew Brisbane- Bali return 30/8 - 12/9. Refurbished 737/800 in excellent condition. Good seating plenty of leg room. I'm 120Kg they gave me and the wife a vacant seat between us without having to ask which was very nice same on return leg. Left on time arrived on time both ways. Excellent service by attentive staff. Could not find fault with any aspect of the trip. Never flown Garuda before. Definitely will again! Entertainment system works fine good selection of movies (Tip use your own ipod head set far better sound quality).
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,CGK-BKK on 11/9 and BKK-CGK 14/9 on a 737-800. Decided to try out the national carrier. To Bangkok - delayed. Booked seat but the attendant said it had already been released or not booked. Don't understand. On the way back delayed again. Was given a middle seat while again had booked a front row aisle seat. Toilet queue was long and waitress asked us to queue in two rows for the toilet! With the national carrier you get to carry your cabin luggage down the stairs brave the drizzle stand on the bus to your terminal before you realize that it's all stairs up to the immigration area. I can't believe this. This was my last flight with them. I paid full fares for my tickets and was wait listed for executive class. Very disappointed.
,,,First Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,PEK-DLC 16/8/13. Newish B738 on time departure and arrival (bit unusual in China). I think Dalian Airlines offshoot of Air China. Good service and food no complaints.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Semarang-Jakarta-Bangkok. Both flight were on time. On my first flight the aircraft was new with sky interior cabin. Flight to Bangkok was on time the cabin was clean all the flight attendant were attentive and really care with the passenger. However Garuda need to improve their Entertainment system especially for a flightof more than 3 hours.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,CGK-PDG on Boeing 737-800. Departure to PDG was on time as well as the arrival. On boarding received a nice smile from the flight attendant. The meal was standard but delicious. There is no Audio Video On Demand at every seat but only one every 3 rows. When I asked for additional drinks the service wasn't as good. Inflight entertainment was ok but the sounds was too low.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,CGK-TPE (GA852). Orange juice given as welcome drink nice inflight entertainment with AVOD great meals and FA's were very friendly. GA's fare is much cheaper than CI/BR even AirAsia.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,5,yes,9,From Jakarta to Bangkok and vice versa. During the flight there was nothing too special but the cabin crew were friendly enough and courteous to passengers. For entertainment too little and the touch screen is very hard and very difficult to use. And I just hope that there is improved entertainment facilities to be used more easily.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,5,CGK-MKS A330-300. Friendly flight attendants entertainment is not toO bad nice cabin interior and on time schedule.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,PER-DPS. Relatively new 737. Food good. The entertainment system could be improved as the sound was barely audible. Service was average. The attendants were generally well presented and well mannered however in order to get a drink were sent to the galley ourselves. On this route Garuda still well outshines its competitors in terms of service food entertainment and value for money.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Denpasar to Cengkareng 12 August 2013 with GA421 777-300ER. Delayed 25 minutes because of late arrival. Excellent interior design and service.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,PER - DPS. Good flight. Plenty of room as plane was only 1/3 full so we were given 3 seats up front for the two of us. The dinner was good for airline food. I found I could not watch the inflight entertainment as the sound level was so low and the headphones they give you do not fit well. I tried turning the sound up but was still not loud enough. The other strange thing is that they did not offer tea or coffee after dinner. Compared with the other airlines on this route Garuda offers a lot more space and comfort and as the other airlines increase their price Garuda is becoming very competitive.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,Boeing 777-300ER Flight 232 To Jeddah. Enjoyed this flight. With a working earphone delicious meal and working TV. Very grateful to the cabin crew.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew CGK-SIN and HKG-CGK last month. Flight from Jakarta to Singapore was nice. Although something went wrong at first because the flight I booked was already full they transferred me to another GA flight leaving just an hour earlier. The 737-800 was very nice with clean lavatory and sleek clean exterior. Meal was alright with the traditional Indonesian food. Swift boarding and disembarking throughout all legs. The flight from Hong Kong to Jakarta was also nice overall. Clean lavatory and had a decent meal too. The AVOD was terrible. It didn't respond very well and the person in front of me had to suffer the consequences. Outdated and needs to be updated. But overall very nice for a 4-star airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,SUB-CGK using Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Departed late but arrived on time at CGK airport without any baggage trouble. In-flight meal is adequate for short route travel. In-flight entertainment is good as always however the headphone needs to be repaired soon for the next flight services - one side is off. Will travel again with Garuda Indonesia in the nearest future and hoping that Garuda will use its renowned Airbus A330 or Boeing 777 for one of the CGK-SUB vv services soon.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,"Return flight Jakarta-Denpasar. Check-in easy and efficient staff very friendly the plane was very modern. In addition we had individual TVs with video on demand! This is the first time that I have found an airline providing VOD system for a short-haul flight! Plane departed on time and for both flights arrived half an hour before schedule! The only bad point for my trip: I've waited for almost 45 minutes to get my luggage and thought they lost it. But actually they made a mistake by placing my luggage in the ""executive class passengers"" part of the arrival point. I highly recommend Garuda Indonesia for its high sense of service efficiency and reliability."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,CGK-ICN-CGK on GA's newest A330. Both flights leave on time. Welcome drink on economy class is a very nice touch. Cabin crews are excellent as they constantly smile regularly walk through the cabin to make sure everything is fine and being helpful. Their language skill is also excellent; all Korean cabin crews onboard are even able to speak Bahasa Indonesia clearly. The inflight entertainment is pretty outdated although it still has plenty of good movies to watch. The seat is very comfortable and has plenty of legroom but it has no legrest. Inflight meal is delicious they even serve the Korean ginseng chicken meal on my return flight. The immigration onboard is amazing and saves my time a lot upon my arrival at CGK. However GA should improve their amenity kits. They should add kits more than a pair of socks and a blindfold. Garuda should also serve hot towels which are better than the cold towels that are currently being served for economy passengers.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,I recently took flight and have been very impressed with Garuda Indonesia. In the fasting month of Ramadan most Indonesians Muslims don't eat during the daytime and we are offered boxes to carry our inflight meal. This service has impressed me a lot as Garuda Indonesia has been committed to constantly give better service for their passengers even in this special occasion. Cabin crew are also very friendly and smiley they always give the nice greetings and service for all passengers. The only con I had might be the check-in system on CGK as the system migration has not been fully adopted the check-in was late and the ground staff were not really standby during the process. Meanwhile the inflight entertainment is not updated compared to other airlines.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,Denpasar-Sydney 16 July. We were running tight for time encounters to Denpasar from Doha with Qatar. Emailed ahead and met at Denpasar by ground staff escorted through the airport arrivals etc to check in to make flight to Sydney. Top marks for Garuda ground staff. Flight on time and in flight service excellent. A330 with full flat beds friendly service and would have no hesitation flying Garuda again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Melbourne to Denpasar return on an A330-300. Both flights were great. Cabin crew extremely friendly and constantly offered drinks. The snacks and meals served on both flights were of a good standard. The plane was in a good condition and there was plenty of leg room. The inflight entertainment offered a good selection of movies and other shows. All flights were on time. Very impressed with Garuda Indonesia.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew SYD - Denpasar early May. Business class. On time dep and arr. A30 both ways nice cabin all clean. Very good service - very friendly. Certainly best choice on this route as full service airline. Highly recommend on this experience.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,Abu Dhabi to CGK last week and I have been really impressed with the level of quality and service. Even though at that time GA encountered problems due to system migration but the agent managed the trip very well. Onboard the aircraft the cabin crew were sweet and charming and seemed to be very professional. The entertainment system must be upgraded though as well as English announcement made by the cabin crew. The food was tasty and cabin crew didn't hesitate to offer more food as the business class was not fully booked. In a sum GA has impressed me and looking forward to fly with them again in the future.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Departed 29th June on GA 715 and returned on 12th June on GA 714 - Sydney to Denpasar return. Garuda have really improved over the last 3 years since I have been flying them. The business class service is fantastic and the lie flat seat on 330-200 was very comfortable. The only improvement I would suggest is a better business class food.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,SIN-CGK on 4th July 2013 with GA0827. Ground staff very helpful and also onoard! The food was really good - a chicken dish with rice! Landing was on time. I will fly Garuda Indonesia again!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,I was flying GA-550 from CGK to PKY. On time schedule good VOD (video on demand) and good F&B. Smooth landing and the captain was very nice in communicating with passengers to inform all flight conditions (altitude speed weather etc).
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,,5,yes,7,Abu Dhabi - Amsterdam. Ticket had EY code as a codeshare. Journey was nice but there were some issues. First of all the entertainment was jammed. It was hard to click at the screen and use this. Hard to change movie or anything. Food was nice but there were no any alcohol beverages. Airbus A330 as usual is a comfortable airplane. Flight on time.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,yes,9,DPS-CGK CGK-MES MES-CGK. Was expecting all flights to have the Entertainment System as advertised but it was not. Hopefully soon. The rest was great.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,JKT-SOC Flight GA220 on May 20th 2013 on B737-800 last month. The aircraft was very nice clean helpful stewardesses with smiles. Good inflight services. I will recommend.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,CGK-ICN vv. Very good experience on board on time great services and good food although on ICN-CGK stint everybody was forced to have only one choice. Decent leg room and seat comfort but the cabin temperature was too cold on CGK-ICN stint. Unfortunately our great on board experience was not along with the booking process unlike the other major airlines including low cost carrier that allowed you to make seat selection during ticket purchase with Garuda it was impossible to do that. No facility for web check as well.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,2,no,2,Jakarta - Singapore (29 June 2013). Meal was horrible earphones were not working on one side volume was hardly audible. Service crew were simply lifeless and lack of warmth. Not even a budget airline like AirAsia provided such disappointing experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Denpasar to Hong Kong return. This really was a tale of two flights. Outbound the crew semi interested I asked for a wine with my lunch. None on the trolley when it did arrive it was in a paper cup. AVOD was a little difficult to navigate using the touch screen. The return leg was a complete reversal. Attentive smiling crew a glass of wine served at the same time as dinner. Good flight times and price for this route.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,CGK-SUB using Boeing 737-800NG aircraft. Got upgraded to Executive Class for CGK-SUB service. A very pleasant check-in service for all Garuda Indonesia's Executive Class passengers including me. Though boarding procedures in CGK were a little confusing due to changing gates successfully managed to depart on time for this service. On- board the aircraft seats were very comfortable with pretty decent legroom. In-flight entertainment needs larger screen such as on A330s. Food much more plentiful than in Economy Class. Overall the experience on this domestic service was pretty impressive.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,3 domestic flights. SUB-DPS DPS-JOG JOG-CGK. Check in very efficient at every location although the waiting area at Bali left a lot to be desired. All flights were in modern clean aircraft and the in-flight service and communication was excellent. The efficiency with which they served a snack on the 35 minute flight to Denpassar was impressive!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,B737-800NG and 800 series. Very nice and tidy cabin FA's were very polite and helpful very patient with children. Comfortable cabin but on my last flight the cabin was hot prior to take off (737-800 series) but it got better in the air. Food was ok (stuffed bread) and welcome drink served soon after seatbelt sign was off. Overall all my flights were quite nice.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,5,Yesterday 11 June I flew business class on GA 417 from Denpasar to Jakarta. The in flight service was excellent we left on time clean new plane and good food but on landing the ground handling was extremely bad. After disembarking we had a long walk through the terminal and then had to board buses this is normal but still irritating however this time we had to wait a long time for the buses to arrive a small executive bus arrived first and business class passengers were pushed aside by everyone trying to get on the bus at the same time until it was so packed that it became unsafe. No Garuda ground staff were supervising. The Jakarta terminal procedures for incoming Bali flights have always been bad for years.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Flight GA715 from Sydney to Denpasar economy. Plane left on time was very clean and modern Food was good and cabin service excellent. The cabin crew were very friendly and attentive. In-flight entertainment worked a treat with video on demand and a good choice of movies etc. The aircraft was an Airbus A332 and this is great for couples as the seating is 2-4-2 and you can get a window and aisle seat together. Highly recommended.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,GA305 SUB-CGK on May 30 2013 Y class. Really impressed with their service from ground handling to inflight service although food can be improved from just a sandwich because many competing airlines have provided better food even on a short haul flight. FA service which was very attentive and friendly. All in all a very pleasant flight and I would highly recommend Garuda Indonesia to anyone travelling to/from Indonesia.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,HKG-CGK first time flying international route with GA. Cabin crews are friendly but IMO isn't on par with SQ and OZ. Welcome drinks are served before take off. Drinks and peanuts are disturbed an hour before the meal service. Food is OK just like any other regular airplane food. After meal service cabin crews serve drinks throughout the whole flight. Overall a very pleasant flight GA has improved dramatically I just hope they train the cabin crew better in friendliness and hospitality.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,CGK-SUB vv flight (GA 310 and GA 325). My outgoing stint unfortunately had to be shifted to flight 306 due to the impact of check in system failure on the previous day. It was a 1.5 hour delay but Garuda surprisingly had given delay compensation of IDR 400000 (USD 42) to all impacted passengers. Great improvement. The incoming flight was great pretty much on time. Despite the delay the rest were very satisfying.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,1,no,3,BKK-CGK-BKK on A320. I must say I was quite disappointed with the product. Plane quite old seats stained (brown anyway so you could only see the worst stains) but at least AVOD. Food was tasteless needed some salt and pepper but alas not available! Limited selection of alcoholic drinks (beer and wine only). Both times plane left 30 mins later but arrived more or less on time. Wasn't worth all the extra money as compared to LCC.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,CGK-MEL-DPS-CGK. Despite being a frequent traveller I had never flown Garuda on international routes until 2 weeks ago. Return flight from Jakarta to Melbourne and I was pleasantly surprised by their level of service. Departing flight GA 716 on Airbus 332 check in smooth and departed on time. On board service pleasant and efficient - welcome drinks served before take off - cabin crew were approachable but not overtly friendly. Thanks to the relatively empty aircraft I managed to sleep throughout the red-eye flight. Breakfast of omelette and sausages was tasty. On returning journey 6 hour flight I watched 2 movies and a short sketch on their VOD system. Selection of movies was decent. In addition to main meals mangoes/blueberry Ice cream was served before landing in Denpasar/Bali My only criticism is the connecting flight arrangement in Bali. I had to take my luggage out before proceeding to the domestic lounge. Although I had staff assisting me the whole process was indeed unnecessary. They should provide connecting passengers with check-in baggage service to their final destinations. I recommend Garuda and would fly them again on international routes nonetheless I would avoid taking a transit route to Jakarta via Bali.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,Taken return flights from CGK-SYD flying economy class with load factor was only about 30-50% on each flight. The check-in process in CGK was very slow and the staff wasn't really enthusiast although I'm a gold frequent flyer card holder. Both flights were so far so great cabin crew were very friendly and attentive especially on the SYD- CGK sector. The meal were also very tasty even though the quantity was very small. The entertainment system was a little bit disappointing and not updated compared to other airlines. Overall very nice trip to fly with Garuda Indonesia as the service has continued to improve and the cabin crew do represent the company's missions.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,2 internal local flights GA436 and GA437 from Denpasar to Lombok return. Both flights in 737 which was clean and in good condition. All flights on time as scheduled. Flight attendants friendly and well presented lollies dished out before takeoff and iced tea served during this short flight of approximately 30 minutes. Smooth landings and takeoffs and Captain communicates well with the passengers on both flights. Nice route with beautiful views of mountains and volcano on the descent into Lombok. Also flew Garuda international flight from Denpasar to Sydney. Flight departed on time. Flight attendants well presented friendly and continually serviced the plane. Top service throughout the whole flight as this is a full service flight. A snack roll and drinks were served after takeoff. Given socks and a blanket and the entertainment was good with new movies. Breakfast served in the morning. Clean A330 plane. Nothing to fault except the turbulence we encountered on the way home. Would fly again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,3,yes,9,SUB-BPN-SUB 4-5 May 2013. Flight with new B737-800 NG seat was comfortable and cabin very clean. Cabin crew very friendly polite and always smiling. Meal on this route was good. Will fly with Garuda again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,KUL-CGK-KUL. New aircraft and flight attendants who are friendly and attentive. Welcome drink is served even on short flight and amount of food is more than sufficient for the journey. The return flight was delayed for almost an hour although it was announced that it was only going to be a 15 minutes delay prior to departure. Overall was a good flight.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,SYD-DPS. This airline just continues to get better every time I fly them. Check in perfect visa on board very convenient. Qantas lounge at Sydney is a pleasant way to wait for flight. Easy boarding cabin clean and almost empty in business cabin. Seat fantastic very comfortable in all positions. IFE entertained me for the whole 6.5 hour flight no problems. Noise cancelling headphones are not Bose but the do help and make for a more comfortable flight. Champagne has been upgraded to billecart salmon and was excellent. Entree trio of salmon was excellent chicken main was too spiced for me (I'm a chilli wimp tho). I would definitely recommend Garuda.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,SRG-CGK-AMS (1 February) first flight with new B738 seat was comfortable and clean. Second flight was delayed 15 minutes flew with A332 there is no map in the entertainment system. In CGK they have executive check-in counter and personal assistance which was convenient. They did the immigration in the lounge so didn't have to spend my time at immigration counter. The flight stopover in AUH (Abu Dhabi) 1.5 hour in AUH nice airport to transit than Dubai but the boarding process was horrible there was no priority boarding for Business Class passenger. Arrive in AMS 1 hour late due the headwind. Overall the flight were nice definitely will fly again with Garuda.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,CGK-PEK in business class. Very comfortable new design in cabin fully reclining seat and a warm welcoming smile from cabin crew.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,CGK-DPS round trip initial flight on a 738NG and return flight on a A330-300 that previously served an Australian destination. Check in was simple. On the aircraft the flight was as expected excellent. Service of the FA's IFE options and food are good. Plane was clean and seat was not tight. DPS-CGK. Airline did not inform us about the check-in relocation which was the domestic wing of an unfinished new terminal. There the check-in was longer but it could not be helped due to the missing equipment for the staff based in an unfinished terminal. Boarding the A333 was pleasant first time boarding one since improvement of their airline their aircraft usually serves medium-haul flights and the airplane feels spacious despite a high seating capacity that could've made seat comfort difficult. Staff were very attentive onboard. IFE was limited however as programs were blocked due to the route served. IFE also offered the ability to access files on a USB to the IFE monitor but no USB input was found on the seat. All flights on Economy cabin anything not mentioned is unknown.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,SYD-DPS Executive Class. First time flying with Garuda. The immigration on board saved lots of time and queuing on arrival. Food entertainment system staff seat A330 plane all excellent. Flight attendants seemed to walk through the cabin every 30 seconds checking on everyone. Lay flat seat got me a couple of hours sleep.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,CGK-BTH-CGK 10-12 March 2013. Inbound flight was one of older B737-800 no AVOD but the meal was tasty the crew excellent. Outbound flight was B737-800 with AVOD clean aircraft good meal and handling of my baggage. The crew smiled during the flight. No delays on both flights.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,10,GA 178 from Jakarta to Pekanbaru on 17 March. The service was very friendly and courteous from the cabin crew. Additionally purser on this flight are very friendly and communicative to the passengers. He greeted the passengers and offered newspapers and other reading materials. Overall service is very satisfying.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,7,CGK-MES-CGK. Inconsistent product offering by Garuda - outbound flight in a new 737-8NG plane with AVOD and headrest. The inbound flight in much older plane with no AVOD and seat was similar to those low cost carrier. Meal in domestic flight was standard. The only stand out point was the flight attendants which working absolutely hard to serve the passengers.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Have had 2 return flights MEL-DPS in the last few months all 4 flights have been excellent. All have arrived on time or early the A330-300 planes have been fantastic the seating is comfortable and have even been able to sleep on the night flights. Staff are friendly and courteous as usual.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,7,Jakarta - Sydney on 19 March. I requested an exit row seat on this overnight flight and was pleased when the check-in agent said that would be no problem at all. Very disappointed to discover that my seat turned out to be nothing of the sort - it was in fact the very last row on the aircraft right next to the noisy galley and toilets which made it difficult to sleep. Other than that the flight was quite good - a small late-night snack was served and a decent breakfast before landing. There's a rather modest offering of movies/TV shows - OK for a 7 hour flight. Cabin crew was up to Garuda's usual high standard.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Flight to Melbourne (GA 716 March 17 2013) and from Sydney (GA 713 March 24 2013). They were both pretty much on time very good services from the crew. Seat pitch was above average for 6 hours distance. The only drawback is the check in system that is not able to be managed through the web and besides seating selection menu was not available in the booking process.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,5,yes,6,Flying from CGK-JED (return) with GA executive class the aircraft was 747-400 which is ageing. Aircraft was clean and the service was quite standard for business class. The meal selections were okay and nothing special for the trip. Cabin crew were attentive and chatty but they're also very professional and friendly. The main gripe was check-in process in Jeddah which was very chaotic and there's no executive class counter. The price at this sector was very reasonable for executive class however GA must really improve their service in CGK-JED-CGK sector which is still abandoned than other sectors of GA.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,15 Feb SYD-DPS. Aircraft was a near new A330-200. Departure delayed 30 min due to Sydney airspace. Time was made up en-route. Ground and in-flight service was impeccable food and drink were of exemplary quality. There was plenty of space with comfortable seats. In-flight entertainment was a limited but the movies were good quality. The best feature was the in-flight immigration service so no queuing on arrival at DPS. This is an excellent service and full kudos to Garuda for making it happen. In-flight immigration was also available for economy class.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,I and my wife flew from SYD to JKT on 17 Dec and returned to SYD on 7 Jan 2013. We also did a few travels with Garuda domestically within Indonesia. I observed a major improvement in services provided by Garuda. The quality consistency has been great. Firstly the ticket prices were quite affordable given it was a peak holiday season (i.e. Christmas and NY). The departures have been on-time. Services on-board were quite good. Food was alright and entertainment was up-to-date. The cabin crews were friendly and attentive. The immigration on-board made it easy for passenger to avoid long queue at Jakarta's airport. Most importantly these services have been so consistent from one Garuda flight to the other. We can only conclude that Garuda is clearly improved.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,SUB-CGK on Jan 23 and CGK-SUB on Jan 25 using the new Boeing 737-800NG after discovering a promo for the tickets. Check-in at Juanda Airport Surabaya was neat although check-in at Soekarno-Hatta Airport Jakarta was faster due to the dedicated check-in counter for GFF Silver (I am a holder of Garuda Frequent Flyer - Silver). Seat was okay for departure but seat for return was much fine. Surprisingly in-flight entertainment was up-to-date for both routes which was different than the previous time I used the airline for the same route. For this short route passengers should be given more portion for the in-flight food. I will travel again with Garuda Indonesia because of the reliable price and service. I'm hoping that next time Garuda will use Airbus A330-200 aircraft for this busiest route in Indonesia.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,3,yes,9,1 Jan 2013 from Singapore to Jakarta and 23rd Jan 2013 from Jakarta to Singapore both in C Class. Check-in staff especially in Jakarta was very attentive and professional. Inflight service was excellent. The cabin crew was professional service minded and well mannered. I certainly will fly Garuda again but this time long-haul.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,3,yes,8,CGK-DPS on a 738 DPS-CGK on a 333. First flight's check-in was mediocre not perfect nor horrible. One of my passengers forced me to sit in the emergency aisle the design of the arm rests for the emergency aisle seats make leg comfort too tight. Food was excellent and crew are very attentive. IFE content was limited on board due to the flight being a regional trip but is updated nonetheless. Flight was quick and on time. Second flight was on board an uncommon aircraft which allowed me to see inside their mid-haul fleet. Check- in is slow but this could be a result of the ongoing renovation of DPS. I was able to not sit in the emergency aisle. Seat pitch on board the 333 is very good fits tall passengers. Seat layout of 2-4-2 does not make seating tight another big plus. Attentive FA excellent food but IFE is limited again. The seat did not provide a USB gate even though the IFE menu has the option to access media from the USB. Great flight though. Price overall was fair.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Had two short-haul flights with them last week: CGK-JOG (GA208) and back 2 days later on board (GA217). Both legs served by fairly new B738 with acceptable comfort and attentive service carried out by smiling and professional crew. Flights on time and check-in took less than 10minutes both in Jakarta and Yogjakarta. Would surely fly them again for domestic flights in Indonesia in the future and probably would also give them a chance for a long-haul trip.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,8,CGK-MLG-CGK on Boeing 737-500. Both flights on time. Since 737-500 is an old plane there is no VOD or other inflight entertainment. Garuda should consider using newer plane such as 787NG on Jakarta-Malang route. Cabin crew were excellent meal was ok. Luggage service at CGK is terrible. It took 30 min - 1 hour to get my luggage. Overall I was satisfied.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew GA for the first time SYD-CGK and CGK-MEL and both flights excellent. A330-200 new and bright. Check- in for both flights easy and no queues. In-flight service usual Asian attention to detail and always with a smile. SYD-CGK had onboard Visa service which is great added value. Very impressive overall.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,First time travelling with Garuda Indonesia GA712 SYD-JKT (15 Dec 2012) and return GA 713 JKT-SYD (25 Jan 2013). Check-In Boarding and Inflight Services good. (Little bit unorganised at CGK). The only disappointment - both sectors missed out the pre-ordered Child meal even though it was booked and printed on our tickets. The food portion a bit small and tasteless. Entertainment response slow on the older A330-200. Onboard immigration facilities is great. Save a lot of time and hassle on the long queue at CGK. Great improvement on punctuality both sectors arrived at destination early. Keep up the good work.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,HKG-DPS-PER-CGK-HKG. Considering I was flying to Australia via Bali during festive high season Dec 22nd (had to stop one night for next connection) the price of USD 1750 return all inclusive could not be beaten. It was not flat bed but cradle seat instead it was quite comfortable though. Service was efficient and courteous. IFE was sufficient on their touch screen personal TV. The choice of menu was great I always choose Indonesian cuisine. Toiletry bag headphones and menu distributed upon arrival plus the welcome drinks. All sectors had the same plane (12 seats in business class) I must say I was impressed by the whole experience take off and landing were smooth and on time. If their prices continue to be this reasonable I am more than happy to fly with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,CGK-NRT with Airbus A330-200. I tried Garuda the first time in 2004 I was impressed by the cabin improvement and innovation. Personal screens featuring AVOD nice new FA uniform and brand new economy class seats. Overall experience is good.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,CGK-PER vv via DPS with B737-800NG. Flight departed on time in the morning around 6 am from CGK. Check in was smooth. Inflight service was great and the cabin looked clean and tidy. On the return flew B737-800NG the service given was as good as usual. Will definitely fly Garuda again!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,no,,JKT-DPS-SIN. Flight to Denpasar from Jakarta left on time and cabin service was fine. Flight to Singapore from Denpasar delayed by 4 hours because of the late arrival of the plane. I find this unacceptable because this particular sector which leaves Denpasar at 7.05 pm is codeshared with KLM and SQ. The plane had to serve the Jakarta-Yogyakarta-Denpasar sector before flying to Singapore. It could not land in Yogyakarta because of bad weather and had to be diverted to Surabaya where it waited for 2 hours until the weather was clear. Then it flew to Yogyakarta before heading to Denpasar. I arrived in Singapore at 1.20 am on Monday instead of 9.20 pm on Sunday.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,7,CGK-DPS-MEL-CGK last December. A330-200 was bright while the A330-300 looks tired. The seat pitch and choices of IFE are decent for medium haul trips. The food was ok but the portions were a bit disappointing. The crew were ok. Check in staff in MEL were fantastic and efficient.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,,2,no,5,PER-DPS return. As per previous reviews - your Garuda experience depends on where you get on the plane. We were once again delivered a mediocre check-in at Perth International on the early afternoon flight on the 27th of December. They are more interested in checking in economy passengers at the business class check- in. When someone at economy check-in waved us over it resulted in a long very delayed check-in because the clerk had to keep walking over to the business class check-in for lounge passes etc. The Qantas lounge ran out of food when we got there and when I brought that to the receptionist's attention I was informed that there would be more food in 5 minutes. The 5 minutes turned out to be an hour. Normal chaotic boarding followed - no priority boarding for business class. Service on board was good except the cabin staff allowed economy class passengers to use the business class toilet and did not even try to prevent it. Back to Perth on 3 January early morning flight. They forgot to load the menus and we had to ask them for drinks during the flight - it was not offered on their own accord. Garuda is starting to drop the ball and as their prices are not very competitive anymore I think that I would start looking at other airlines' premium class offering to Bali. Garuda's inconsistent service offering in their premium class on this route is just not worth the money anymore.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,GA716 CGK-MEL 11 Jan 2013. Flight departed on schedule but arrived in Melbourne 30 minutes late. Clean and tidy cabin polite and friendly FAs. It was a red-eye flight and I found it a bit strange that the FAs did not circulate the cabin with water and light beverages overnight as they usually do. The IFE had a fair choice of current movies as well as a good selection of short features. Food was adequate although the portion was a little on the small side. All in all a decent and comfortable flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,CGK-GTO Economy-Class. Flew on clean and well maintained B738. Cabin crew were very efficient and attentive. Had two choice of hot meals and it was tasty yet the portion was slightly below competitors. I am a sliver GFF member had excess baggage around 10kg and the check-in staff didn't charge me for it. The minor complaint is they do not offer a pillow and blanket for domestic flights and in-flight entertainment has not been updated in 2 years. Still recommend!
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,CGK-PEK-CGK. Planes are fairly new thus you will get consistency in terms of product offering. This route to Beijing they use Airbus 330-200 both flights left on time. Outbound leg left late at night and arrived in Beijing Capital early in the morning. Service is great on both legs FA's are friendly and very helpful to passengers meals served is good and in adequate portion. Outbound leg IFE offering is not too good with limited selection of movies but inbound leg to Jakarta they've changed the movies offering which is very good and I am able to enjoy 4 movies on the AVOD during this 7 hours flight. Will fly with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,yes,9,Jakarta-Denpasar-Perth leaving on 22 Dec returning 30 Dec. Both flights on time. Very full flights on all sectors. Movie selection is good for Denpasar-Perth-Denpasar sector (good and up to date) but disappointing for Jakarta-Denpasar-Jakarta sector. Overall very good experience and satisfied with the service. Hopefully they will introduce direct flight Jakarta-Perth soon.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,CGK-SUB. Afternoon GA flight on this route was not full as usual providing more legroom in advance due to vacancy on seats closer to me (while I got an aisle seat). Meal was adequate service was excellent but IFE needs more updates especially movies. Overall I was very satisfied with Garuda Indonesia's service which was equal to the price I spent. Will fly with GA again in the future.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,Flight from Amsterdam via Abu Dhabi to Jakarta. Service was great food quality good. Media system wasn't amazing but there was one in every seat which isn't available on all airlines. Overall very pleased.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,MEL-DPS-CGK (GA719 and GA415) 21 Dec 2012. Retro-fitted A330-300. Both flights departed on time and arrived early. FAs were friendly and attentive although during the MEL-DPS leg the inflight service felt a bit rushed. The cabin announcements were clear and concise with greatly improved pronunciation. Good IFE average food. The transfer process at DPS was seamless and hassle-free. Garuda has definitely stepped up their game - will fly them again in the future.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,3,yes,10,BPN-DPS with stopover at SUB. All services were excellent especially for the IFE. Cabin crews were very attentive. The cabin was clean and well-maintained. The price for me was a bit expensive. Overall it was an excellent flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,MEL-CGK on refurbished A330-300. Seating comfortable leg room is much better than the newer A330-200. Departing MEL delayed 25 minutes but arrived CGK on time. Smooth flight. FA attentive and helpful. Would expect more movie selections. Catering needs to improve. The nice touch of ice cream was gone and be replaced by a muesli bar. Overall good direct flight MEL-CGK.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,HKG-DPS-PER. I booked a business class return flight from HKG to Perth at a very special price. I was very impressed with the service despite it was not their newest flat bed seat but for a short fight it's ok. The 737 sits 1 people with 2 staffs. Service was very good and the food too. Luggage arrived first in Bali also in Perth it has personal TV and AVOD for the price it was a true bargain and I will not hesitate to recommend it.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew CGK-AMS flight slightly delayed due to radar breakdown but overall flight was ok. Food reasonable and service friendly. Announcements in English should be improved.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,CGK-PVG-CGK. Ground staff was very helpful. Good business lounge on time schedule seat fully flat bed good food but not special entertainment need to be updated especially the movies. Excellent service from the crew.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,CGK-UPG. Smooth and comfortable flight with A332. Catering was a bit of a let down with cold rice but AVOD was good. UPG-CGK in B738 crew very attentive and catering was much better. Highly recommended.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,,4,yes,10,Garuda's Executive lounge was very comfortable and the Nasi Liwet was delicious. Service in lounge and in flight was polite and cheerful. Flight delayed 25 minutes but that seems to be the norm now in CGK airport. Flight to Surabaya was a short hop but the meals presented was very good. Kopi Tobruk is offered upon request. FA on this flight really made us feel welcome and they seem to enjoy what they were doing.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Travelled SYD-CGK-BKK return. Check in at Sydney fast and efficient spent an hour in the Qantas business class lounge then onto the plane. Had to overnight at CGK airport hotel but now Garuda has same day connecting flights from BKK. Service was fantastic on all legs and business class passengers are cared for. The only thing we had any qualms with was the entertainment was a bit poor and the food was just ok. For the price we paid literally only half the price of its competitors we would most certainly fly Garuda again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,SYD-DPS GA715. DPS-SYD GA714 in Economy Class. Check in at Sydney Airport was a breeze. Didn't weigh our carry on. When we boarded flight attendants were very welcoming. Indonesian music was playing before we boarded and before we landed in DPS. Seats were comfortable. Meal service was excellent with hot meals. Several snacks and drinks served throughout the flight. Flight attendants were eager to help. Good range of movies and music in the backseat entertainment including flight map. Immigration on-board was a huge bonus and saved us plenty of time. Receiving our bags at Denpasar Airport was fairly quick. Return flight DPS-CGK (Jakarta) - SYD. We told check-in staff at the Domestic Airport in DPS that we wanted to collect our bags only at SYD and he said he could put us on a direct flight. Walked to International Airport which is next door and waited. Our flight was delayed due to a late arrival. Given a muffin and juice on board before lights were turned down. Hot breakfast was nice. Sydney Airport baggage collection was easy. I would highly recommend Garuda Indonesia.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,8,CGK-YOG. On time flight and had a user friendly inflight entertainment system. Seat was comfortable but a bit cramped.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,SYD-DPS-SYD. Fantastic fully serviced flight departed on time ex SYD and arrival to Denpasar at a great time of 1.30pm local time. Service with a smile inflight entertainment food and beverages of a good standard. DPS-SYD - Departed 1 hr late and no airbridge bus to plane on tarmac in the rain.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,DPS-MEL-DPS in business class. Excellent cabin very comfortable fully reclining seat and a warm smile welcoming me from FA's. FA's very helpful - represent Indonesian hospitality. Will fly Garuda again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,PKU-CGK-PKU on Oct 26 2012 and again on Oct 28 2012. Flight attendants very friendly and helpful. The food is tasty had fried rice when I flew out in the morning and rice with chicken curry on my return. Before take off flight attendants handed out candy to all passengers.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,Seoul (ICN) to Jakarta (CGK) was excellent. Flight was on time. Crew were polite and smiled as I boarded the aircraft. The catering was nice. Legroom okay. Priority boarding for disabled passengers. Garuda should work on their Inflight entertainment and add some more up to date movies. Overall it was quite good. Take off and landing were smooth and professional. Very recommended.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,"CGK-PKU on August 10th. On time performance began from boarding to pushback to take off. On boarding the aircraft the crew gave the ""Garuda Indonesia greeting"" with hands clasped together. Before take off given candy and I had PTV in my seat. Catering was great."
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Jakarta - Taipei. Garuda now have a dedicated business class check in area at Jakarta airport once checked in an agent escorts you directly to the lounge completes your departure card and deals with immigration formalities for you returning 10 minutes later with your passport stamped. Outbound flight was overnight and not particularly comfortable as they use B737-800 which has very limited recline even in business class so difficult to sleep. Service was good (and the J cabin was full) but quite limited as most passengers just wanted to sleep. Substantial breakfast served before arrival into Taipei. Return flight was daytime and very nice. Garuda uses the CAL Dynasty lounge at Taipei airport. Snacks served on take off and then a full lunch service a couple of hours later. Champagne and decent selection of wines offered. Given a fast pass immigration card so no need to queue upon arrival at Soekarno Hatta which was a big bonus as queues at immigration were very long. Business class luggage was delivered quite quickly by hand to a priority luggage bay near carousel. Overall very good indeed and very reasonable fare of USD 770 return.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,6,6 November GA 719 Melbourne to Denpasar 2 hours late. Because of delay in turn around plane was not properly cleaned. The food was substandard even for Indonesian cuisine and the choice was fish or fish. Inflight Entertainment selection is poor and focussed on Asian Movies. Strange the Australian flights are 90% Caucasian. As a FF platinum Card holder the entitlements are dropping and it is no longer an acceptable standard compared with other airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew SYD-CGK-SYD in October 2012. The flight is smooth and pleasant. Seat comfortable with plenty of leg room. Immigration on board is a plus. Love the Indonesian Orchestra songs while waiting to take off and after landed. Flight attendants are now not as friendly as before less smiles. Food - very disappointed with the SYD-CGK leg. I don't know why the rendang was running out just before half of the passengers were served. Very disappointing. Entertainment good collection of movies but it's not organised. Touch screen is not responsive.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,yes,9,Food is nice but variety of foods should be improved especially for high demand route DPS-JKT-DPS. A bit disappointed with the frequent flyer program and benefits which are not as attractive as other airlines. On my last flight JKT-DPS some of the cabin crew were rude. They need to improve the cabin crew language skills their announcements were not clear.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,Sydney-Denpasar return in Economy. Only paid an extra $300 more than Jetstar but I think it was well worth it! The meals were quite good entertainment kept me busy enough for the 5 hour flight and the FA’s were lovely. The onboard Immigration is a huge time saver! SYD-DPS leaves at approx 10am so you're in Bali by 4pm local time which is very convenient. I just wish the return flight was the same but it leaves at 11.30pm. Definitely fly Garuda again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,SOC-CGK a short 1 hour domestic flight using the new B 737-800 with the Boeing Sky interior & mood lighting. Excellent service despite a very short flight attentive FA's adequate snack plenty of drink service and AVOD is available. On time departure and arrival overall a very smooth and enjoyable flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,MEL-CGK-DPS was excellent. MEL-CGK an A330-300. Decent legroom very welcoming staff. We had to take the bus at CGK because the boarding gate was moved to a very far one nearly across the terminal. Onboard catering was good for economy class. MEL-CGK I was offered a traditional Indonesian Cuisine. Staff nice chatty and fun. IFE however was a bit disappointing.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,3,yes,5,"We travelled Sydney to Denpensar Denpensar to Hong Kong and then Hong Kong back to Sydney via Jakarta. All business class. Sydney flight all smooth sailing they ran out of champange - but it was the weekend and it was a plane of Auzzies! Heading to Hong Kong from Denpensar was a bit like entering the set of ""Faulty Towers"" We had jam covered seats moved to broken seats then were moved back to another row of dirty seats - all the time being told ""so sorry"" but no-one thought to actually wipe down the armrest in the middle and actually clean it. Which I did myself in the end turning a lovely white napkin into a deep shade of grey. The food was also very average bland and woudl not rate the freshness factor of the bread rolls served. The constant ""sorry"" but no effort to clean correct or offer any compensation (I remember travelling Singapore airlines enconomy class with a broken Screen - straight away I was offered a $50 duty free voucher - not a big gesture but it made the difference in my perception of the trip). On this leg of the trip we paid full price used real money and in return did not receive a business class experience. We are now travelling the last leg Hong Kong back to Sydney via Jakarta. The seats work oddly enough the dirty armrest status has not changed. The food on this leg was good mango salsa and prawns was a delightful flavour sensation. Get the feeling that business class can be a bit hit and miss with Garuda depending on where you pick up the plane."
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Sydney to Denpasar Executive class. Quick check in we had plenty of luggage as we were flying with our 10 month son did have to ask for the priority passport control cards for return leg. Qantas business lounge was half full so plenty of seating. Seat 1A/B welcome drinks and travel packs handed out wife happy with L'Occitane lip balm inflight service was pretty good. Food was good our flight attendant wasn't the friendliest but she was very professional. Cabin had plenty of kids in it all well behaved. In flight visa service is excellent made up time in the air and arrived on time our luggage was out first and the whole process from landing to taxi was done in around 35mins. Well priced package for business class would fly again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,August 2012 - excellent service. I flew to Bali - only $100 more than JetStar but had baggage and meals included. The Cabin Crew were hospitable. We were given welcome drinks in economy menus pillows blankets amenity kits toothbrushes in the rest rooms newspapers. Clean modern aircraft - the plane was not full and check in staff blocked the seat next to me so I had 2 seats to myself on the way over and back. Enjoyed the A330 where you are only ever one seat from aisle in economy. Plenty of leg room - I could easily cross my legs in economy. I went to Jakarta as well and had a brand new 737 with Sky Interior. The standard felt and better than Qantas in economy. Would definitely recommend for future flights.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,TKG-CGK-SUB in Business Class August 16 2012. All sectors were on time and smooth. Cabin crews were friendly and attentive as usual especially on CGK-SUB sector when she knew that I took some pictures of the served meal she offered me the other meal option to be photographed as well. FA walked along the aisle several times during the flight to ensure the pax needs. Meals and drinks were good and nice presentation however the quantity can be added. When disembark they mentioned us by name.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,MEL-DPS and I was impressed. Check in was painless at Melbourne and the boarding procedures were efficient. Once on board the relatively new A330-300 we were welcomed by friendly flight attendants and had excellent seats with very generous legroom.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,My wife and I flew from Sydney to Denpasar (Bali) return on an A330. Aircraft's were modern and clean and tidy inside. The cabin crew were all well groomed polite and gave excellent service. Our flights left 10-25 mins late but this delay was mostly made up on route. Before takeoff given drinks and meals were a nice quality and nice quality. On the return journey they had run out of choices by the time they got to our seats but the cabin crew made sure that we got first pick of the croissants and breads. Another really good service that Garuda offer is on board passport control. 2 immigration officers travel on the flight and do the passport and immigration procedures on the aircraft during the flight and Garuda collect the fee on their behalf. This service as far as I know is only between Australia and Indonesia. This made the process of passing through the airport quick and efficient. Areas where I think they could improve further: My wife and I found the seat backs to be a little hard on the return journey I would like to see the inflight info (speed location etc - map) on our seat back screens. No web check in was available and I would like to see the option of selecting seats at booking. I found it annoying and inconvenient having to be taken between the aircraft and Denpasar terminal by bus and would like to see Garuda use the jet bridges. Would I fly with Garuda again? Yes! They offer a far superior service and price to budget airlines like Jetstar and Virgin.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,Flight from Jakarta (CGK) to Seoul (ICN) was excellent. The crew were mostly polite but unfortunately they didn't serve supper only snacks and they dimmed the cabin lights. Breakfast and Inflight entertainment was good although they should update more newer movies.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew from Sydney to Bangkok via Jakarta in August 2012. Flight was on time. Plane was A330-200 and looked new. Seats advertised as fully flat bed although when lying down your legs were at a slight angle downwards. Plenty of leg room. There were 7 business passengers in the 2 business cabins (separated by Galley). Flight attendants were very friendly and attentive without being overbearing. Someone was always going through the cabin and any request was happily complied with. I could not fault the service and product received. Check in was very competent with a friendly male staff member.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,SYD-CGK in Business Class. New planes with comfortable business cabin in 2-2-2 lay out with lie flat beds. Day flight from Sydney included 6 course lunch all served with full linen service and understated friendliness. IFE not up to the leaders but adequate for the 8 hours. On board immigration a stand out - pays huge dividends on arrival into Jakarta. Return overnight flight rated slightly lower but still very nice. Service was also more about getting everyone bedded down rather than serving a gourmet feast but that is fair enough. Breakfast prior to landing simple but tasty.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,CGK-HKG-CKG on A330. Flight delayed 1 hour in CGK-HKG though we were informed the night before the departure which was good. The food was small and small snack offered compared to other airlines on the same route. Good service from the FA in CGK-HKG but really slow service at the inbound flight. The AVOD doesn't have really much choice for new movies but ok.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,21 July 2012 CGK-HKG A330-200. Garuda Indonesia Lounge in CGK is excellent! Plenty of hot and cold food selections. Friendly check in staff at CGK but unfortunately no Valet Service. Immigration was very fast thanks to FASTPASS! Boarding commenced 15mins before and I sat at 2C while my wife in 2A. This aircraft used new inflight entertainment system. Cabin staff greet you by name once you are seated. Drinks were offered from fresh juice to champagne. Pilot gave flight details very clearly. Off the gate exactly at 10am. After take off drinks were served and after that lunch. During the 4.5 hrs flight to my surprise every 10-15 minutes the cabin crew walk along the aisle to make sure if we need anything. Landed on time at HKG. After we parked at the gate we went out first from the aircraft. Will definitely fly business class again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,AMS- CGK 16 August 2012. Smooth and enjoyable flight. Flight was full in economy and quite empty in Executive class. Flight attendants were attentive and genuine. Although I think the meals served had small portions for a long haul flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,,5,yes,9,MEL-CGK-PDG-CGK-MEL. Excellent flights on all sectors. Very helpful ground staff in Jakarta had an admin problem with my passport but all taken care of by the check in staff quickly. Asked for emergency row seat and was given without hesitation. Crews were friendly as usual. Adequate IFE but lacking newer movies and tv series. Catering was good in all sectors although quantity were still quite small no improvement since last year. All in all had very pleasant experience with Garuda and definitely becoming preferred choice these days.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Impressed with this flight. Service and food very good. The seats were comfortable for angled lie flats. A330-300. Flight left on time at 9.50. Lunch served just after midday and included a choice of nibbles appetiser main course cheese and then dessert and coffee with chocolates. Small portions but just right considering the number of courses. Inflight entertainment options were good. Nothing to complain about!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew CGK-PLM in economy class. Cabin crew attentive and helpful. Cabin clean and neat seat pitch was very good and lavatory clean. Aircraft was flawless but unfortunately no AVOD at this short hop. Punctual. Will definitely fly them again on my next trip to SIN.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew from SYD-CGK return in economy class. I was very happy with service provided by the cabin crew and the food was fantastic! Liked the on-board immigration service. It saves so much time once arriving in Jakarta.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,CGK-DPS return very pleasant flight with B737-8. Attentive cabin staff call button immediately answered. Food was not bad but noticed they have changed to plastic cutlery. AVOD system was good for the 1.5hours flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,CGK-DPS-CGK. Garuda is the best option to fly domestic sectors in Indonesia. There's PTV in every seat in economy with decent entertainment options considering the short length of the flights. The attentiveness and friendliness that the FAs provided were excellent. The foods portion are rather small but I like the idea that GA provides Indonesian foods on their domestic flights. Overall a very pleasant experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,PER-CGK via DPS was as simple as the return flight CGK-PER via DPS. Excellent service attentive crew nice cabin fantastic AVOD system for my 3.5hr trip there and back. Food was lovely got to try all 3 options beef chicken or seafood. Travelled on B737-800NG.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,Bali-Jakarta. Very comfortable seat wide screen new movies. Overall the entertainment was good enough. The food was fine. FA's ok.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,5,yes,8,MEL-DPS-MEL. Flight to Bali in a A330-300 8th July. Older style plane. Reasonable service except they didn't load correct food so everyone got the same chicken dish - which was fine. Poor service however - I pressed the button 18 times and was completely ignored. When an FA did walk past and I asked for a drink she rolled her eyes and checked her watch. Average choice of IFE - lots of old films nothing really new. Plane itself however was comfortable. They did miss the safety check prior to landing and people had tray tables down seat reclined. Flight 18th July DPS-MEL new A330-200. New plane but very limited and poor choice of IFE. FA's attentive but they had no western breakfast left after row 10. Otherwise a good flight and we got a good thorough safety check prior to landing. For the price and the service they are a good option for flying to Bali.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,SYD-DXB-AMS return. Planes are relatively new with very attentive cabin crew. Food was excellent and tasty. Flights on time except on the return - delay of 1.5 hours unexplained in Dubai whereby guests were left waiting on the plane and outside in Dubai airport. Very comfortable trip. Only negative is that online check in is not possible and their website is temperamental so recommend you arrive very early to secure good seats.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,CGK-UPG on economy class A330-200 and UPG-CGK on business class B737-800. CGK-UPG trip was nice their newest A332 product has been improved well. IFE was good but movies must be updated with the latest. Food was ok though too small in quantity. Both leg FAs very attentive. Always smile. UPG-CGK on their newest business class really enjoyable. IFE was fine movies selection are better than the Economy class. Seat was comfortable. Food was great but expected a little more in quantity since it was Business Class. The price paid was awesome! Got 25% off by Student ID Card on my business class ticket. Definitely fly Garuda in the future.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,Singapore via Denpasar. Upon check-in at Perth on Saturday 7 July we were informed that we had to collect our bags in Denpasar and clear immigration - despite the fact that we were given boarding passes for our connecting flight to Singapore on the same day. When I enquired about the lounge passes we were informed that Garuda had no lounge in Denpasar. Having arrived we cleared customs but were unable to collect our bags - these had been correctly transferred and would be on the flight to Singapore with us later in the day. Somehow we missed the rep that was sent to collect us at the gate as we were transferring. Flights to Denpasar and later to Singapore were of a very high standard except for some very annoying children in the business class cabin I had to ask the parents to contain their two toddlers who were being real nuisances. Service and food on both flight were excellent and we were addressed by name at all times. Flight from Singapore to Bali on the 10th of July also excellent. However - flight from Denpasar to Perth on the 13th of July was average to poor - we had to ask for everything (wet towels drinks etc.). No menus distributed and staff rushed through the lunch service as soon as possible after take-off and then spent the rest of the 3.5 flight hiding behind the curtain. This is unacceptable for business class service. Garuda really needs to get the business class staff to step up their service on this route. We will be flying again in October and it will be interesting to see whether there is any improvement on the Denpasar - Perth route.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,BDO-SUB. A new domestic route opened in 2012. Very enjoyable 1-hour flight compared to other airlines which also serves this route. Great B735 interior and comfort entertainment was OK though it was only 'Just For Laughs' screened on the overhead TVs but it's understandable since it's a short flight. Newspapers were offered as reading materials in addition to meals and choices of drinks. The only lack was that the male flight attendant did not smile at all. Garuda should improve the friendliness of male flight attendants.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,SIN-JAK-SUB-DPS-SIN. A pleasant experience on a Boeing 737-800. Flight attendants were friendly but cabin service was rushed during the Jakarta- Surabaya and Surabaya-Denpasar sectors and food was so-so during the Singapore-Jakarta Denpasar-Singapore sectors. The entertainment system was good but could be better. The choice of films is not so exciting though.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,CGK-HKG return on their new A330. Nice IFE at all seats and easy to use. Nice attitude of FA's who made us feel comfortable on board. The catering was delicious but portion a bit small. Will fly GA on my next trip to SYD.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,SYD-AMS-DXB return. Food was great service was as attentive as any other major airlines I have flown. Seats were perhaps a little uncomfortable but it appears they have two different A300 aircraft they use and one of them has wider seats. iFE was fine nothing amazing but certainly did the job and had some very recent movies. Staff were excellent and went over and above. Price was dirt cheap at $1250 return. Highly recommended.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,NRT-CGK-MEL with A332 and A333. Both flights were nice and comfortable. Flight attendants were some of the best. However still need to update the AVOD. Overall the flight was flawless.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,6,Return flights from Perth to Osaka KIX via Denpasar Bali in business class. Flights were OK clean aircraft good seats meal selection geared to Asian audience good wine selection. Service uneven but not indifferent. However the stops in Bali (6 hours outward and 3 hrs inbound) reveal an area for vast improvement. The business lounge at Denpasar is not worthy of the name and airport authorities can be very unpleasant. A pity that an otherwise positive travel experience is spoiled by such easily remediable incompetence.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew from AMS-CGK-MEL return. Everything was good except the entertainment. The leg room is enough for me - 188 cm tall and the meals were delicious. Cabin crew were very attentive and chatty. Overall I'd take GA again for my next trips.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew SYD-AMS return last month. Very inexpensive fare what you would pay with a legacy carrier in Premium Eco. From start to finish an excellent experience. Qantas Club access in Sydney. New A330-200 up to CGK and onto AMS. Seat very comfortable in upright recline and lie-flat position - able to get quite a bit of sleep. Warm welcome onboard with refills of drinks before departure. Food choice and quality more than enough for all legs. Lounge in JKT very chic with warm surrounds. Crown Lounge used in AMS. IFE very easy to use with wide variety of choice. The real difference is a genuine sense of caring for their passengers. Small problem on return with points being added to wife's FF account. 1 call to SYD office to fix problem a week ago. Today new card reflecting Gold status delivered to home address from CGK by courier. Yes the leg home takes a little longer due to lay-over in Jakarta but for the price and service nothing beats it. Well deserved 4 stars.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,Flight from DPS-MEL night flight and the crew were amazing. As most of the passengers were sleeping they still went through the cabin the entire flight to made sure we were ok and asking if we needed drinks or food.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew GA couple of times within the past 3 months both domestic and international routes. Satisfied with the service facilities and punctuality. Will fly GA whenever possible.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,3,yes,8,CGK-HKG-CGK all in A330-200 with 2-4-2 seat configuration. I got USD 485 for return tickets. Comfortable seat with good pitch and width. Welcome drink and delicious meal. Great entertainment system. Attentive cabin crews. Cabin cleanliness is good but need more attention. Definitely will fly with Garuda again in my next trip to Japan.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,CGK-BKK-CGK. 3.5 hours flight. The service was remarkable as usual. Cabin was clean and nice AVOD needs to be updated but good and meals were nice yet a little too small. Cabin crew were attentive and hospitable. Their service seems to be much better.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Flight: In last month. MDC-CGK return. Newspaper was offered upon flight flight was full but comfortable seat was good inflight breakfast for MDC-CGK and dinner for CGK-MDC was good and delicious with 2 choices each flight. Wide range of drinks and beverages was offered on and after meal service. Polite and very helpful is well known for their FA's pilots very informative. AVOD was good but they need to add more current movies and music. Also the AVOD was sometimes unresponsive with its touch screen system which made it difficult to use. I'd like to suggest they put Indonesian subtitles on their movies onboard so every passenger could enjoy the movies offered. Overall I'm very satisfied with their service and would like to fly them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,yes,9,CGK-HKG return with A330-200 the cabin crew were helpful and nice meal was good but the size quite small. The thing that GA needs to be improve is the AVOD because the movies are not up to date mostly below 2010 and no flight path but GA is much better.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew Garuda for my Jakarta-Perth trip vv via Denpasar. Using new B737-800. Cabin was comfortable meals good enough and there were plenty of choices of drinks. The cabin crews were the best aspect of this flight. They gave sincere service were really hospitable and attentive. Overall the flight was really comfortable and will definitely fly them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,,,3,yes,6,SIN-DPS-SIN. Flight was on-time food was nice flight attendants friendly. The only downside of it was the aircon - not working properly while waiting for take-off. Passengers were left sweating for almost 20 mins. Flight back to SIN was delayed for almost 30 mins then once onboard there were problems with the electrical system. We were waiting almost 20 mins until being told to leave the aircraft because they needed to change the plane. There seemed to be a problem with co-ordination with the ground team. We were told to wait - after 20 mins - asked to queue for the meal - only to be told to move back to the gate to board the plane after 10 mins. Knowing that the problem still persisted - they finally gave in to change the plane - why waste our time then? One last thing the in-flight entertainment was not good - there were few new movies - but other that old and movies I had never heard before. The touch screen navigation was clunky and my console restarted repeatedly while playing the movies - forcing me to watch the ads again and fast forwarding to the last point. Regardless all the issues I feel Garuda has done a very good job in transforming from where it was 5-10 years ago however definitely there are plenty more rooms to improve.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,MDC-CGK old Boeing 737-300 with the old cabin. Seats not as good as the new ones and no PTV installed only entrainment was the overhead TV above the isle. Good selection of food and drinks although I've had better ones with other Garuda flights. Friendly FA and good overall service.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,CGK-SIN return with Garuda's new 738. Cabin and toilet are very clean. FA's are very attentive friendly and helpful. Meals quite delicious although the quantity is quite small. Good seat pitch. Nice AVOD. Definitely will fly Garuda again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,CGK-SYD-CGK. Using the new A332 aircraft. Clean cabin and toilet throughout the flight food was ok plenty choices of drinks and very hospitable service from the crew. The crew always full of smiles and friendly. Will definitely fly them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Usually fly AirAsia on internal Indonesian flights as they are good value however recently it is cheaper to fly with a better airline. Garuda was much cheaper to fly from Bali to Jakarta than a budget airline plus the service is much better. A meal free baggage and great staff. Would fly Garuda again.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,I flew from Jakarta to Sydney in Business Class and it was fantastic! The cabin seat food and flight attendants were world class. The only fault I could find was that there was no 'flight tracker' option on the AVOD system. Other than that I had a great experience and look forward to flying with Garuda Indonesia again soon.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,MEL-DPS. Check-in at the airport was average (not done by Garuda staff) we were not given passes for the lounge even though we had 1hr 15 min before the flight left. Business class great the seats are very comfortable and flat bed if you want to sleep. Crew are always there to assist you if you require any additional during the flight. I'll definitely fly with Garuda Indonesia for my next trip.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,JKT-JED with B747-400. Good check-in. Flight attendants excellent friendly and full of smile. New crew uniforms look very pretty. Food as good as any I've had. Interior was very clean. Overall I highly recommend Garuda and will fly again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,CGK-SIN. Good clean aircraft with new livery and interior. First time flying GA after at least 9 years. Everything is improving: friendly FA cool-looking interior good food (portion is bit too small) welcome drink AVOD IFE clean toilets. Will fly GA again!
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,,4,yes,8,CGK-SHA-CGK. Friendly and helpful flight attendants meals are ok comfortable seat in Business class. Value for money got promo fare and seat easily good communication with sales.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Flew Garuda a week ago in economy class domestic sector Jakarta to Surabaya. It was on time aircraft was clean and felt and looked somewhat new it was 737-800. IFE was available on AVOD food and drinks were good. Flight attendants were friendly.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,SYD-DPS-SYD Airbus A330-200. Very good flight. Clean and new plane. Great service with all the bells and whistles (like they used to be). Everyone has their own IFE with a great selection of movies. Plenty of drinks available juices etc. Food was ok. Punctuality was great with both outbound and inbound leaving and arriving on time. Only issue is with the departure time of the return flight. 2am ex-Denpassar with 2 small kids is a bit difficult! Considering the alternative low cost carrier flying this route Garuda should have it all sewn up as they are a full service airline!
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,CGK-MES-CGK. The cabin crew were friendly and kindly asking what we needed to be more comfortable. The outbound meals were ok but the inbound to CGK wasn't very good but for overall service it was nice.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,SYD-DPS. Return flight was very comfortable on brand new A330-200 very good movies selection and good food. Immigration onboard was very convenient and we managed to get through and collect our luggage in less than 15 minutes.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,CGK-NRT-CGK with A332 aircraft. Clean cabin throughout the flight good meals plenty choices of drinks and the flawless service from the cabin crew. Definitely will fly them again.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Business class to Bali from Sydney. Excellent flight from check-in to arrival. Qantas lounge used prior to departure. Travel on 330-200 aircraft which had lie flat seats. Good leg room. Meals ok although small meals felt full after the lunch service - ice cream prior to arrival. Ok selection of movies on this flight. Inflight immigration service made the arrival process into Bali a smoother process. Was able to purchase $25 Visa at Sydney check in counter all I had to do was pick up my bag which arrived after the surfboards and other large items of luggage. Will fly them again soon to Amsterdam as fares are good price in all classes and service outstanding.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Jakarta-Shanghai-Jakarta. Airbus 330-200. First leg CGK-PVG in Business Class seat pitch is great service very attentive flight departed on time overall the hardware is excellent and on par with other leading airlines. As the flight left at midnight most passengers were asleep thanks to the lie flat seat able to get a good rest. Breakfast served approaching Shanghai. Return leg in Economy Class service is excellent despite the almost full flight. Very good selection of AVOD continuous drink service and a good lunch.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Dubai-Jakarta-Denpasar : A very pleasant flight FAs were attentive friendly and helpful and the food was excellent. Toilets clean very comfortable seat in economy class with AVOD and nice entertainment system.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,CGK-UPG with A330. Ground staff polite. Very friendly flight attendants. Food portion always small as usual but the taste was good. IFE selections not so good but it was only a 2 hours flight. Late take off by about 20 minutes. Will use again.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,,5,yes,9,I have flown executive class recently - both times the route was MEL-CGK-JOG return. Impressed with the service - from booking and seat allocation through to cabin comfort service and efficient handling of a late baggage arrival at JOG end when a late arrival at CGK meant I made the flight but my baggage didn't. Staff on the ground at all locations have been courteous and onboard comfort and service is excellent. I will definitely be flying Garuda again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Dubai to Amsterdam. Had the same crew on both flights. Initial welcome was good greeted with cologne tissues served with juice/water and nuts. Lunch at a good time plates removed as soon as finished later sandwich or cake with juice/coffee. Food was good good quality TV screen in the back of seats with a sufficient numbers of movie choices. Cabin Crew always smiling and very attentive.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Sydney to Amsterdam return. Ticket was fantastic value for money. (A330-200 were almost new and in excellent condition. Cabin crew fantastic. Food was good and drinks offered frequently. Only criticism is 15 hours wait in Jakarta for connecting flight to Sydney. We were able to use Emerald lounge at the airport (free of charge on SYD-AMS flight) with plenty of food and drinks but the wait is agonisingly long.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,7,PER-DPS-HKG-CGK-MEL. Service on all flights very good and attentive. Good selection of drinks and excellent wines. Falls down in the food department - none were appetising. All airport lounges used were average to say the least. Flight to DPS was old 737-800 whereas flight to HKG was 737-800 but a new brighter plane. HKG-CKK a new A330-200 very comfortable with good AVOD. All flights on time with the exception of CGK- MEL which departed 1 hr late. Flight from CGK was the only night flight of the trip and we flew A330-300. Whilst the bed is reasonably flat I did not find it comfortable. Excellent value for money in Executive Class.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,DPS-PER 737-800. Air Asia cancelled our original flight and I rebooked with Garuda for nearly half the cost - and full service! The aircraft was new and clean. Flight on schedule and staff were friendly and attentive. AVOD was excellent. The meal was average but on a 3 hour flight who cares? I had previously been wary about Garuda but they have improved immensely and I would fly with them any time.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,SYD-JKT. Airfares are very competitive compared to competitors. Fast and efficient departure on-time FA's are attentive and friendly. Cabin was spacious and no problem with leg room. I got 30kg for my baggage allowance AVOD and food were pretty good compared to some other airlines. Overall I am pleased and will fly them again.
