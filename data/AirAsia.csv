✅ Trip Verified ,A320-NEO,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Krabi,June 2024,4.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,9, Flew from Don Mueang airport with Air Asia. I’ve never had a bad flight with them. I class then as a clinical low cost airline. Crew is always nice and buy on board options available. For a one hour flight there was zero complaints.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Medan to Kuala Lumpur,August 2024,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,2,no,1," They didn’t tell me at check in counter that I couldn’t bring my tripod. I could brought it from KL to here via hand carry bag but from Medan to KL cannot. They didn’t tell us beforehand and told us that we as passengers need to ask what we can bring and cannot bring. It’s utterly ridiculous and doesn’t make any sense, I need to ask all items in my bags 1 by 1? They should put it in writing if that item is not allowed. Or at least told us when checking in. It’s really a stupid airline and please do not use AirAsia."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur,August 2024,3.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,2,"   I arrived at the airport at 6PM, four hours before my flight was scheduled to leave for KL and it was a matter of minutes before we noticed that our flight was delayed an hour. There was an earlier flight but when we requested to check in that flight, the staff told us that we arrived five minutes late to reserve the flight. So we stayed at the airport waiting to check in for another hour as we finally did. At the boarding gate, we realised that the flight might be delayed another hour the time to refuel. At 11PM, 1 hour after we were supposed to leave, we finally took off. During the flight, I asked for earplugs to help with sleeping and they said they had ran out. We landed 1 hour off schedule and that was the end of my journey with AirAsia. I highly recommend Malaysia Airlines as an alternative as they have excellent service for a couple hundred RM more."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cebu to Seoul via Manila,August 2024,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1," Learned the hard was that this is basically the Spirit Airlines of Asia. The flight may be cheap, but they don’t give a checked bag and also will weigh everything down to .01 kilo, even the personal item combined with the carry on to be less than 7 kg. Basically the situation where they charge low and look for reasons to charge more when you arrive. Recommend not booking with them."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Jaipur ,July 2024,,,,,,2.0,3,no,2,"  Three hour delay, jam packed terminal and no information or help from ground crew. Poor F&B Services, and very few toilets. Information screens say something and staff says something else."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320-200,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Jakarta to Bangkok Don Mueang ,June 2024,4.0,4.0,,,,5.0,4,yes,9,"  Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta to Bangkok Don Mueang. Since I did not purchase anything but a certain amount of baggage allowance, I was automatically assigned a certain seat during boarding. I was originally selected to be seated far away from my other family members, but the check-in staff members are gracious enough to make us seated not far apart. Boarding was done and completed in a timely manner, and this time, they dispatched an aircraft that had the newest batch of AirAsia seats supplied by Mirus Hawk. The seat itself, despite being slimline, was comfortable and had a few inches of extra legroom compared to the usual AirAsia seats. The only drawback was that the seat pocket was made of woven rods glued to the seat which easily became detached under some load. The cabin itself was very clean, comfortable, and in good condition overall. Take-off was on time, and there was supposedly a free Wi-Fi onboard, but it did not work. The crews did not inform it being operative as well and there was no sign saying the plane has Wi-Fi, so it's safe to say that perhaps there was indeed no Wi-Fi. The cabin crews were efficient, professional, and attentive, but I think they could improve on friendliness and some communication skills as they weren't as friendly as my previous AirAsia and Indonesia AirAsia flights. Landing was 5 minutes ahead of schedule, and my bags were delivered relatively quickly. Overall, considering that they have just defended the World's Best Low Cost Airline title, they could have done better in some aspects, but it's safe to say, I still enjoyed the flight."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Shantou China ,July 2023,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,2,no,1," I made a mistake booking the flight. The date I booked was one month out, Aug instead of July. I did not realise the system had defaulted to Aug. I tried to contact AirAsia, but everywhere I turned on their website and Move Mobile App I was referred to ""Chat to Bo"" (not a real person). One of the suggestions from Bo was to reschedule the flights to my intended date using the link provide by Bo. The penalty was 125% of the price of my original ticket using his link. Making it 225% of the price of the ticket. If I were to book another ticket for the appropriate date flight, I would save 25% and keep the other ticket as well (not sure what I would do with it, though). By then it was after hours (yes, they don't have after-hour service, for an airline?). I checked the net overnight, thank goodness, they do have a ""full refund if cancel within 24hr policy"". Also, I checked for the procedure for the refund. It seemed there was a way but it would require further information (the all-important Order Number) from AirAsia. Easy, but not really. This information used to be provided to the customer in the form of processing the order. In mine case, this information was withheld, and I can understand. Without this number, the refund process stalled. The system does not accept my confirmed book number/code which should be adequate for all booking matters. I continued, spending many hours, looking for avenue to talk to someone or somewhere in the App to point me in the direction. Found none. Their office starts at 9am. I phoned before, right on 9am, and many times after. Before 9am, it said it was outside office hours. Right at 9am, I was connected. Yeah! But, only to be told they have ""Unusually High Volume of Calls"" and referred me to their website or ""Chat with Bo"". In the first seconds of 9am? Come on! Are they kidding me? I logged 10 calls over the next hour all with the same message. No chance to queue at all. For those interest, I logged 38 times to Move (AirAsia) website in the morning until my 24hr period of free cancellation was exhausted. While they have the cancellation policy, my only conclusion is the purpose of Policy document is to provide cover for accreditation and they certainly have no intention to allow customers accessing it. Their IT specialist must have read Catch-22 many times to come up with the algorithm to make sure me, as a customer, go round and around and come back to the starting point or to get you paying a lot of money unnecessary. There is a big difference between a customer focus quality company and one that hides in the tall grass waiting for you to make a mistake and pounce on you. Unfortunately, AirAsia is of the latter group of companies."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320-200,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Yogyakarta to Kuala Lumpur ,June 2024,4.0,4.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4,yes,9,"  Yogyakarta to Kuala Lumpur onboard their Airbus A320-200. Check-in at Yogyakarta was absolutely fast and we were met with friendly staff members all around. Boarding was made slightly late, but at the end of the day, boarding was completed way before the scheduled departure time. The cabin was spotless and in its best condition, and my seat, albeit tight, was decent for this 2.5-hour flight. Sadly, paperwork issues grounded our aircraft by an hour. However, once we took off, the cabin staff members immediately served meals, beverages, and duty-free items. They were friendly but could have been a little bit friendlier and more proficient in their communication skills because they were inconsistent with the announcements. Some were done in Malay only, some were done in both English and Malay. They were also a bit too stern in their tone usage. Wi-Fi entertainment was provided on this flight and it ran very fast on both my phone and my laptop. It had plenty of selections, an improvement over my previous flight with their subsidiary, Indonesia AirAsia. Landing was obviously late, but I arrived at the carousel and only waited less than 5 minutes for my bag to arrive. Overall, this was an enjoyable short-haul international flight, and after knowing this airline for almost 15 years, they haven't failed my trust."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Naha to Bangkok,May 2024,3.0,5.0,,,,4.0,5,yes,8,"  Check in efficient and friendly. Security check took about an hour, unusual for otherwise efficient Japanese airports. Boarding rather unorganized despite 6 gate agents. Flight uneventful, friendly IFA, flight arrived in BKK 30 minutes ahead of time. Recommended"
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Naha,May 2024,3.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,9,  Well organized boarding. Flight uneventful no frills and on time. Staff friendly and efficient. It’s the perfect flight if looking for a budget flight from Bangkok to Japan. Recommended
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to Bangkok,May 2024,,,,,,,1,no,1,  I tried to change my VietJet Air flight booked through AirAsia app. The company promised get back to me in 24 hours. They didn't. Then I contacted them through chat (it is very difficult to contact real human in this company). They managed to cancel my flight change process when I contacted them. Then now after 30 hours they tell me I need to start the whole process again. The worst customer experience of my life. I lost 100 USD. Do not book flights from this company.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phuket to Bali,May 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Please, I urge everyone not to fly with this airline when traveling to Bali or anywhere in Asia. Prior to booking, carefully examine their reviews. On 05/09/2024, during my flight, I encountered issues with their agent attempting to charge me $200 for a bag that was 9KG overweight. After requesting to speak with a supervisor, the price suddenly dropped to $80. Upon arriving in Bali, I noticed significant damage to one of my bags, with personal items missing from the only bag secured with a TSA lock. Despite contacting the airline for assistance, their response, received all the way from Australia, was dismissive, stating that wear and tear costs are not covered, holding me accountable for the damages. This experience has deeply disappointed me as it tainted my first trip to Bali. There has never been an airline I fly with that this has happened to me and I am urging people to not fly with this company."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta,May 2024,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,2,no,2,"   AirAsia is no longer suitable for business travelers. I've been a loyal user for short trips, benefiting from their Premium Flex package, which used to include perks like priority check-in, boarding, and more. However, AirAsia has recently changed its policy on cabin luggage weight, enforcing a 7kg limit, including the weight of a laptop bag."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Penang to Langkawi,April 2024,2.0,4.0,,,,4.0,4,yes,7,"  A flight that left early, unusual and great for travellers. Loading a little cumbersome but mainly from dis organised passengers. Staff affable and helpful. The seats narrow but in good condition"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Phnom Penh,March 2024,4.0,1.0,,,,4.0,3,no,5,"   My flight departed and arrived as scheduled, but the cabin crew's behavior ruined the experience. Upon boarding, I was hurried by a crew member as I searched for my seat. Another crew member yelled at me for taking slightly more than two seconds to move. I frequently fly both domestically and internationally from and within the U.S., and I have never encountered such unprofessionalism and rudeness from flight attendants. This experience was a first for me and left a negative impression. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Kaohsiung ,March 2024,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4.0,5,yes,8,"  I don't know if I am getting shorter with age, or if the seats are further apart now, but it feels like there was more legroom than normal - it wasn't that cramped at all. Everything else is still what you expect from budget airlines, but at these prices who can complain? The flight from Bangkok to Kaohsiung was over before we knew it. Clean cabin, no fuss service and food."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chiang Mai to Bangkok,April 2024,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,2.0,3,no,5,"  I flew with AirAsia several times . The flight was delayed ever time by around 30-40 minutes. The staff on the ground always gives you very optimistic estimates for the delays, and it usually takes longer."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321N,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Krabi to Bangkok,March 2024,2.0,5.0,3.0,,,5.0,4,yes,7,"  Good Flight on time from Krabi to Bangkok. Standard Seat distance is cramped but ok for a short Flight. Had lunch including Package which was okay. So if price it’s low, AirAsia is a good option."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Medan to Kuala Lumpur,March 2024,5.0,4.0,,,,5.0,4,yes,10,"  I am representing a party of 5 seniors traveling from Medan back to Kuala Lumpur after a 4D3N tour on Mar 14/24, and we would like to extend our sincere gratitude to Mr Ruly (Guest Service Officer) of Air Asia at the Medan International Airport Checkin counter desk. Mr Ruly was very pleasant and polite , and quickly booked us a flight back to KL the same day , after our flight on Batik Airline was suddenly cancelled without notice. He went out of his way to help us obtain a flight cancellation letter from Batik Airline at the airport. Further he also helped us saved money in advising us that we could combine the weights of all our check-in luggage, so our overall ticket cost is cheaper. It is not often that you meet nice people like this, especially one who is efficient and served with a warm smile. Our flight back to KL was pleasant, and we arrived 25 mins ahead of schedule! Again not many airlines can match this. Overall we were all very pleased with experience."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Denpasar,March 2024,,,,,,,1,no,1, Booked a connecting flight with them from Singapore to Bali 4 months ago. Today they cancelled it and moved us to a flight that departs 4 hours before we land in Singapore. They suggest we fly the next day but do not want to fund a hotel and we do not want to lose a day of our holiday. Have had to cancel and switch to another airline at considerably higher cost. Could only talk to a BOT.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Batam to Pekanbaru via Kuala Lumpur,March 2024,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  The AirAsia app offers flights combined with other airlines. I booked a flight through the AirAsia app; the first leg operated by Lion and the second by AirAsia. You assume it's one booking (like code sharing) but it's not. Lion was delayed so I missed the connecting flight. Bad luck I had to buy a new ticket to continue my trip. They don't take any responsibility and claim that you booked it through an agent. When you try to file a complaint that's impossible ... you have to chat with that stupid chat bot but that's useless. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Krabi to Kuala lumpur,March 2024,4.0,4.0,,,,1.0,3,no,1,"  Worse customer service. Every email came back as undeliverable, every phone number goes to voice mail. The recording says you can talk to live person via app and website, but it's just a computer chat that can't do anything. Flight was okay, but everything else about this airline was bad. Rudest gate and ticket people I've met. "
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bali to Miri,February 2024,1.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," They have a free cabin baggage policy, but if it exceeds 2-3 kg, you have to pay 250 MYR, which is approximately $50. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Bali,February 2024,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1, Dirty Plane. Trays were dirty and staff were asked to wipe several seat trays. No in flight entertainment. Uninterested staff who were very unaccommodating. Flew back to Perth on QZ534. Even worse experience as I travelled back with my husband and child. We were separated and yet there were several free seats available. We asked if we could sit together as we had a 1 year old with us. They said the plane was full and yet there were several seats available. At the end of the trip I asked to help my husband with the bags as he was carrying the baby. They refused to let me and said I couldn't go back on the plane. They then stood around and watched him struggle to carry the bags and the baby instead of offering to help. They were so uninterested and looked like they weren't enjoying their job. Dissatisfied. Worst experience on an airline.
Not Verified ,A320-200,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh City to Kuala Lumpur,February 2024,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5,yes,9,"  The aircraft was overall very clean. With In-flight Wi-Fi with was great. Seats were incredibly comfortable with great legroom. But there was no In-flight entertainment TVs. Their cabin crew service was great. As this is a low-cost airline there are no complimentary water or snacks. The flight was on-time as well. Since this was a full flight, they offered to check my carry-on luggage for free. Overall I am very satisfied with this amount of service for a low-cost airline. Definitely would fly AirAsia again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Da Nang,February 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," I'm shocked and disappointed! I paid in advance on the 20th of January, and according to the bank, the payment has been successful so far. I received all the proper notifications about my upcoming flights daily. However, when I arrived at the airport, the airline informed me that there are issues with my payment and I need to purchase another ticket, which, of course, costs more. When I called my bank, they confirmed once again that my payment was indeed successful. The airline suggested that I buy another ticket now and request a refund later when I return. I am extremely frustrated for several reasons: - The airline provided incorrect information by sending me letters assuring that everything was okay, but it turned out not to be the case at the airport. The payment I made was successful, as confirmed by the bank. Why didn't the airline refund the money if the payment wasn't successful? Why should I pay more for another ticket when I already paid for the same booking? Now, in order to get a refund, I have to spend my time going to the office because they don't recognize the double payment online."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Krabi,February 2024,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Arrived at the KL airport more than 2 hours before as usual and it was a mess. Queued for several time for the check-in counter until staff told us that the check-in at the counter is extra and we need to do the self check-in. We queue for both check-in and luggage drop. Yes, two different, very slow queues because they put together all the flights. One of our luggage was 1kg too heavy and the machine didn’t accept it, so we open our things and rearrange it. Once back to the machine another surprise, you cannot try again, so go queue again at the service counter. End of the story, missed flight because it was too late to drop the luggage and customer service unable to do anything outside “buy another ticket”  for the next day. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Krabi via Kuala Lumpur,January 2024,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,yes,8,"  My wife and I have traveled SE Asia extensively over the past 18 months with two return trips to Melbourne Australia for short stays. I find the app to be somewhat klunky but I’m used to it by now. However, that’s the only negative. We have found the food to be surprisingly nice considering it’s airline food. The staff are friendly and not once have we had issues with lost luggage. For a low budget airline we’re very satisfied."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Siem Reap to Bangkok,January 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1," I will start but saying that if you are thinking of flying this airline, please don’t and pay a little extra for a better company, that doesn’t hide extra fees. I flew from Siem Reap to Bangkok, I have been travelling with a backpack that has been accepted by every single airline (as it is 40L), but because it was slightly over 7kg I was charged 50 usd and forced to check it in. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Bali,January 2024,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,1,  I would not recommend using it. Low cost is only a joke. Add ons make them more expensive than the quality airlines like Qatar Airways. Unless you only travel with a handbag it is not worth it to use Air Asia.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Penang to Langkawi,January 2024,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," The airline known as AirAsia is the most unsatisfactory flight company I've ever dealt with. They consistently come up with excuses to extract extra money from customers, even resorting to underhanded tactics to coerce additional ticket purchases, as explained in the instances below. Using AirAsia is a major warning sign; it's essential to be cautious with this deceptive company. This marks the second time in a week that I've had an incredibly unpleasant encounter with AirAsia. During the previous flight from Penang to Langkawi, they refused to check in our luggage, citing our arrival 45 minutes past the departure time. Despite being at the KLIA2 counter two hours in advance, successfully checking in our luggage, and passing the hand carry luggage check this time, they insisted on an additional 15 kg. However, at the counter, they refused to add the luggage, once again using the 45-minute rule as an excuse.The staff's impoliteness led to us missing the Miri flight, and we had to secure an alternative flight through Malaysian Airlines. This will be our last experience with the so-called air flight company, AirAsia, making it the most absurd encounter I've ever had with an airline in my life."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Penang,January 2024,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3,no,4," Encountered very rude ground staff. This is a first for me and it was shocking to see such behavior. We were a total of 5 passengers travelling together (2 senior citizens and 1 child) and had cabin luggage of 7kgs each. As we had a kid and 2 senior citizens travelling, just one of the baggages was exceeding 7kgs out of the total 4 bags we were carrying. The way the matter was handled was very unprofessional and disappointing. Will always try to skip this airlines if I have an option."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Colombo to Kuala Lumpur,January 2024,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Third time we experienced delays. Crew seem confused, no clear information. Must rely on internet to learn the reality of the delay period."
Not Verified ,,Business,Premium Economy,Manila to Cebu,December 2023,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," I recently had the misfortune of booking a flight with Air Asia, and it was the most unreliable and frustrating experience I have ever had with an airline and I have flown over 2 million miles mainly on Delta. Not only do they have no live customer service agents to assist with any issues, but when their systems fail, there is absolutely no recourse for the stranded passengers. I was left stranded at the airport with no way of reaching anyone for help, and it was a nightmare trying to get any sort of assistance. It's absolutely unacceptable for an airline to operate in this manner, and I believe they should be held criminally liable for essentially stealing money from their customers. If you cannot provide the service you charged for and you do not have a live person to resolve issues with you airlines you are not operating a business. I would strongly advise against booking any flights with Air Asia, as their lack of reliability and customer service is a major red flag. Save yourself the headache and book with a more reputable airline. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Iloilo,December 2023,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  I booked a Manila to Iloilo flight for 1120am. It got rescheduled due to operational issues to 730pm. Then I get another notification that it is rescheduled to 830pm. I am keeping my fingers crossed that I don't get rescheduled a 4th time though I would not be surprised. I filed a complaint on chat. The agent responded like a bot.  Overall very poor. All the prior reviews I read were not kidding.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Penang to Langkawi,December 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," I paid for ""premium"" and couldn't even use self check in. Nearly missed my flight after having to wait in line for an hour to check in because self check in wasn't working. AirAsia has no excuse for being so incompetent."
Not Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Manila to Davao,December 2023,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2,no,2,"  Non-stop delays! Delay over delay over delay. My flight was 4hrs delayed, but they keep on adjusting the time whenever etd comes close. They could have set a particular time and follow through on that. Might as well they give 4hrs so why not set a given time they can follow. Unprofessional!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Penang to Singapore,November 2023,2.0,4.0,,,,1.0,4,no,3,"  I checked in at counter with two of luggages, one of them is golf bag (11kg). All total weight was 20kg , which is under the limit. But the girl at counter use her mobile to check all the rules then told me that my golf bag is sport equipment, which incured a extra fee. Told her taht I've been travelling with that golf bag around Asia,no airlines charge fees. Even AirAsia didn't charge me when I flight from Singapore to Penang. She insisted and ask her supervisor, the guy even didn't listen at all and said 'She is doing her job.' To avoid to delaying the people behind me, I paid $140 extra for that golf bag. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Tokyo,December 2023,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5,yes,10, Narithtra and Apiwal helped me alot during my check in even though I was misguided by airport staff they both looked after me to change my flights and provided me excellent customer service. Thank you Air Asia to have such great skilled customer service representative who looks after customer and provides great customer service.
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Cam Ranh,December 2023,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,3.0,5,yes,8,"  Don't normally use low cost airlines, apart from Air Asia who tend to do a good job. Kuala Lumpur to Nha Trang with Air Asia offering the only direct flight, check in if you have bags is not easy but otherwise boarding was done well. The seat was comfortable enough for this short 2 hour flight. Departed on tie and arrived a little early. Returning check in much nicer experience, had pre-assigned seats with extra legroom, also ordered food on this leg which was actually fine. Departed on time arrived back in KL on time, bags off quickly great service."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Chiang Mai,November 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,2.0,2,no,2, The flight was half empty and we were all seated together 3 persons 6 persons per row. We politely asked if we could change seat in order to get more space and make everyone happy but the flight attendant was very rude to us and refused for anybody to switch seats.
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Penang to Phuket via Kuala Lumpur,November 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I am unhappy with the flights with AirAsia because in Penang I got my ticket for KL but the worker said that I could get the Phuket one from KL, she didn't even try to check things out and the weather was not well in KL so the plane went Penang to KL and Penang to KL. They said that they will help us out if we miss the plane. When we arrived to KL we had no ticket and the workers in the airport didn't explain clearly so we missed our flight and when we tried to book another flight, the worker said that it was too late to book a. 8.20 flight to Phuket when it was an hour before the fight. She gave us a flight the next day, I wasted my time and the money for a taxi and hotel."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Business,Economy Class,Denpasar to Jakarta,November 2023,3.0,4.0,,,,2.0,4,yes,8," On Line Check-In run well. No need to go to check-in desk in the airport. The plane was clean. Flight was on time (departure & arrival). Seat was a regular pitch for low cost carrier. The cabin crew was friendly. They spoke well and clear when doing the public addresses. There was no in-flight meals, normal for low cost airlines. However, they sold meals through pre-ordered or in-flight order. We landed in T2 in Soekarno Hatta airport and transfered to T1 using bus."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Bangalore via Kuala Lumpur,May 2023,,,,,,,1,no,1,  There is no way to actually speak to a person all the telephone numbers in all the countries I've tried go to a voicemail service.  They happily take your money when you book a flight but after that there is no way to change flights or talk to someone. There is an email type voicemail service even that they take 2 days to reply back you. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Surabaya,October 2023,1.0,5.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  They cancel the flight schedule and gave me other day. I tried to contact AirAsia but cannot connect. The live chat was useless.  This my first time and last time using AirAsia.

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur ,September 2023,1.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,3, The flight attendance were doing their best but the flight comfort itself was an absolute joke. The renting of the blankets for 2 euro or haggling over which food everyone got. Having to show boarding passes again and again to prove what you bought or didn't buy made the whole experience feel so cheap and badly put together. I don't think anyone was happy after that flight. 10 hrs flights with no entertainment is another invention I didn't think I'll experience. The flight itself wasn't even that cheap so I'm wondering why not charge 15 euro extra and give everyone all service they should get on such a long flight... the food prices were not even that expensive so I'm just sitting here n wondering why would anyone choose this uncomfortable situation for both the employees and all customers. I will not soon forget the flight attendant lady raising her voice at an older gentleman customer to tell him he can not change his order of food... it was bad. I didn't know before booking but will surely never book again. Might be ok for a short flight of 2 hrs or so but for long haul it left me with the worst taste in my mouth.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Yangon to Kuala Lumpur,October 2023,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3,no,3,"  Aircraft was delayed 2 hours arriving in Yangon. Slow boarding of bags caused another 30 min delay. The staff never explained the delay, guess it is common. People missed their connections and if they were two separate bookings on AirAsia they would be responsible to buy a new ticket. Ridiculous if you ask me when it was AirAsia's fault they missed a connection. Decent cabin service. But AirAsia's late rate along with them constantly jacking with schedules and moving flights makes me not a fan."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Male,November 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1, My flight was cancelled and rescheduled several times and was 36 hours after my original arrival time. This resulted in an extra hotel night and new flights at the last minute. I filed a claim from Nov 2022 and still have not received my refund. You get a bot that just runs in circle. I am not a rare case and many are in my situation. I will not stay quite on this matter.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vientiane to Bangkok,September 2023,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5,no,5," AirAsia is a budget airline. They seem to do ok once it’s a given that your flight will occur. My biggest complaint with them is that they constantly are changing their schedule, withdrawing flights, changing times of them etc. Out of the 12 flights I had booked with them over half were changed, some by many hours even to different days. This makes scheduling with them extremely difficult. This flight was ok, and originally a nonstop to KUL. But had to waist 3/4 of a day getting to KUL with a stopover in DMK for this flight. Seats are tiny and squished together. That’s what you get for a cheap price. Can’t fault them for that. Just hate their non reliability of any flight booked more than a week out."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi,May 2023,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," By far the worst airlines in Asia. The customer service is made to be as long and difficult as possible. You either have to find solutions with BO chat (useless AI) or hope they respond to your email. My account got locked by AirAsia because they don't send me an OTP for verification, even though I verified myself months ago. Due to my account being locked I can not proceed to make flight changes and any other bookings for a trip I am planning. It takes 15 to 20 days to unlock my account. I asked if they can cancel all my flights instead and give me a refund because of the problem and delays they caused and I can't get my money back. I highly recommend that you should check out any other alternative airlines first before using AirAsia. It can be a smooth transaction but whenever there is a problem you are going to have so many unnecessary problems with this airlines. And you will struggle to find a real person to talk to because everything is with the AI chat system first."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur,September 2023,3.0,4.0,5.0,,,4.0,5,yes,6,"  The check-in process at the airport was relatively efficient, with attentive staff members assisting passengers. The boarding process, though, felt a bit disorganized. It took longer than expected, and there was minimal communication from the gate agents regarding the delay. The cabin of the aircraft was clean and well-maintained, but it appeared a bit dated. The seats were comfortable enough for the duration of the flight, but legroom was limited. I found it difficult to stretch my legs. The cabin crew on my flight was polite and responsive to passenger requests. However, the service was modest at best. But, the food was good. In summary, AirAsia provides a modest service that gets the job done but doesn't go above and beyond. If you're looking for a budget-friendly option and don't mind sacrificing some frills, this airline could be a suitable choice."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Gold Coast to Kuala Lumpur,September 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced. We paid approx $1300 AUD for flexible fare tickets, tried countless times to contact them to change the dates with 10 days notice, were emailing back and forth everyday and the dates still weren't changed on the day we had to fly. There is no phone number or person you can talk to, each email is written by a different person asking the same questions and not doing anything to help you. Avoid this airline at all costs, we now have to look into how to legally get our money back but because they have no offices in Australia how is this possible?"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Delhi to Kochi,September 2023,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5,yes,10," I travelled by Air Asia recently, on an afternoon flight from Delhi to Kochi (I5 549). I had booked the ticket about 2-3 weeks in advance, and got a very good deal on it. The check-in was smooth. There was some delay at the gate and boarding had not started till the scheduled time for departure. Eventually we boarded about 15 Mins beyond the scheduled departure time. The take-off was quite perfect! However, the rest of the flight was smooth, except for one patch of turbulence. The plane was clean and the seat was comfortable. Even though my seat was in 24 row, leg space was not an issue. This flight was an exception. The cabin crew, especially Mr Zebran, were extremely attentive and polite. He made me feel like an honoured guest. Also the food quality was excellent. The landing at Kochi was smooth and the luggage arrived on time. Extra marks for the hospitable cabin crew! Kudos to the team and Obviously Air Asia. Will fly back soon"

What kind of rule is that? Plans change, people need to change their flights. I tried to find a contact number for customer service and searched everywhere, but was not able to find one with a live person. All I can find was a complaint line where I had to leave a message. Now I have to leave the ticket as a loss and buy a new one, I’m not buying from AirAsia. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Siem Reap,September 2023,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,2.0,2,no,1,"  Air Asia what a joke. Their website doesn't work. Their check in machines at the airport don't work. There is no customer service. There are no offices. There are no phone numbers to call. You pay for a minimum of 20kg for luggage regardless of the actual weight (and the price goes up from there if you are the slightest overweight) You are jammed into seats like sardines. Worst flight I have ever taken. They say they will give you credit for your flights. Don't believe them. Your Air Asia account remains blank - no current bookings, no past bookings, no credit history, nothing in any of the folders. Make sure you have your own copy of all flight details cause you won't get them from their website or your Air Asia account. I booked online. When I received my ticket it had the wrong name, birth date and gender. What? I spent weeks hunting down a way to contact them to get it changed. Eventually I just abandoned the flight and booked on another one."

Unusual food served in flight (see picture) was very nice and at affordable price. Flight attendants were extremely friendly not like experience I had with other airlines. Captain made proper announcements, again better than other low cost airlines. 4 Star's from me."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Krabi to Kuala Lumpur,August 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  First, we order a ticket that doesn’t go through, the site tells us that there was an error. Suddenly we receive an email saying it anyways went through. However, the ticket suddenly had the wrong date, which we only realized when standing in the airport. We knew that we had not put the wrong date, because we both checked through everything before submitting the order, and it was further proven later when air Asia again sent a wrong date after having spoken with them on the phone. When standing in the airport in need of another ticket, AirAsia did not help us get the date adjusted unless we paid a huge amount of money. We had to pay still to pay to change our tickets, even though it was never our mistake. Afterwards, we had to call the customer service 5 times, because every time they sent an adjusted offer there was a mistake. Once the wrong flight, another time the wrong time, and then again the wrong date. Only in the end we got it right after having called 5 times. When we then fly from Krabi to Kuala Lumpur where we have to transfer, we have to pick up our luggage and check in again. We were waiting for our luggage for 30 minutes before it arrived. We then ran to the check in counter arriving 10 minutes after the gate closed and the employee did not help us. He said it was too late and we need to buy new tickets. He said that we should know the airline policy of closing the check in counter when there is 1 hour until the flight leaves and that we should have booked flights with longer time apart. I am furious and I am never flying with AirAsia again. "

We flew from Hong Kong to Manila with my family and friends. The flight itself was fine. Some of our hand carry luggage exceeded the weight limit. The lady who checked our luggage scolded us even I told her already that we will check in the excess weight. We opened our luggage so we can take out valuable items and when she saw us doing that she said, I will give you 10 mins to finish that otherwise you cannot board the aircraft. "

The ground service was okay. It delayed 14 minutes before takeoff. Breakfast is served once the aircraft is stable. The cabin crew was kind and gentle. Nearly everything is extremely spicy so I went with the chicken rice and the wonton noodles. The food was tasty. The seats are comfortable enough. The ride was smooth with little turbulence, but the landing was a bit harsh."

Me and my family bought tickets from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur together with 20kg baggage for all 3 of us. I paid the tickets and the 20kg for each of us and got the email confirmation. Just after i realise that 20kg won't be enough since we have 2 check in baggage for each of us, I  purchased another 25kg for each of us. In total I purchased 45kg for each of us. To my surprise at the airport when i did my check in, i was told that all 3 of us were overweight, I had 43kg, my wife had 43.8kg and my son had 44kg. I showed the attendant at the check in counter my 2 receipts (20kg + 25kg). She said their system is showing that i have only 25kg for each of us. I explained to her that i did 2 transactions and i showed her my receipts. The explanation she gave me is that the second transaction was only for an additional 5kg even if i bought for 25kg and this is how their system works.  She charged me an additional AUD 300. Since I didn't want to miss the flight, i didn't have other options to pay but under dispute."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Perth via Kuala Lumpur,August 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,2,"  Not for the first time have I had issues with poor staffing in the terminals, especially at Kuala Lumpur. On the way to Bangkok I was sent to the wrong gate by their concierge. Only to experience a last minute gate change which left me having to run a few kilometers or miss the flight. The worst was to come with the return to Perth flight. Having caught the Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur leg of the connecting flight I arrived at Kuala Lumpur airport with approximately 2 hrs and 15 minutes to spare. Within the Kuala Lumpur baggage claim my baggage was lost/held up and was the last to go down the carousel with one package missing. Going to lost and oversized baggage claim area the officer had to trace where my luggage was which took a very long time. That said I rushed to the AirAsia departure area and asked the customer support which line I must join for baggage drop as they have no visual clues except alphanumerical clues. I was advised to join a the W line, after 15 minutes of waiting an officer asked me where I am going to which I replied “Perth, Australia”. He informed that I should be in the Y line. I rushed around to the Y line, with yet another group of travellers processing massive packages, that done I get to drop my bags to be told the baggage checkin has just closed. I can not catch the connecting flight. When I asked who I may speak to in this regard I was told an officer would be present in about 3 hours. I waited for the officer and presented my case about the luggage being held up, being sent to the wrong drop off point and missing the flight. I was told it was my fault for catching those flights and that I would have to pay more for myself and my luggage for the next flight. I explained that this was an AirAsia to AirAsia connection sold by Trip.com"

I was facing difficulty to cross the custom by using Air Asia the boarding pass and the officer asked me to get land staff counter to verify my information and reprint my boarding pass. I asked the staff to reprint for me and and staff showed her unfriendly face and told me my flight got retimed from 2210 to 2230 without reprint my boarding pass. She asked me to quickly return to cross the immigration. I asked her to reprint and she questions with high tone and said: Do you want me to cancel your flight? I was like so shocked with such rude response from her at that time. This sounds like threatening me. Without further delays, immediately I go back to immigration and still cannot cross through due to boarding pass scan error. I asked the officer to manual assist me to crossing. Finally just in time for boarding."

Pen to KUL late reschedule. KUL to SGN late. AK526 was late for my hospital appt, 55mins reschedule. I arrived back exhausted. I nearly missed my last train, had to run. The worst part of this, they don't care how this impacts on people’s lives. One particular customer facing person at Penang was rude. Luckily the Cabin Staff far more helpful. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Hanoi,July 2023,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Arrived at Gate and staff did not allow me to board simply because my passport's middle name has a dash while my Vietnam evisa does not. Told them it was very normal that you don't/can't use dash in online forms. Gate staff told me they've seen these cases many times and passengers always get denied entry, contrary to my personal experiences. So we missed the flight. It was only after boarding closed did they send me to Service Counter. Service Counter staff was superb. She simply asked Hanoi station if the evisa is valid and got a YES within 10 minutes but that good news was too late for me. Hotel rooms are non-refundable. I asked why couldn't the gate staff ask Hanoi station and the shocking answer was because ""they did not have the right WhatsApp group chat"". Next staff tried to get me a refund but it was rejected. The closest category was ""incomplete documentation"" - implying it's my fault. This is clearly the airline's fault. The Gate Staff misinterpreted visa rules and did not bother to ask proper authorities."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cebu to Gold coast via Kuala Lumpur,July 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,  I recently flew from Cebu to gold coast and I had to throw away a large amount of my carry on bag because it was over weight. My concern is not that I had to discard this stuff it's that the staff wouldn't let me do this and demanded I paid the extra at the gate. I watched them do this with a lot of people. I also watched them weigh guys laptop bags including mine but not ladies handbags. And by the time I threw away what I could I was still 800 grams over weight and they were fighting me on this till the end. When I asked to check the scales calibration they were reluctant and then let me go.

Not Verified ,A330,Business,Economy Class,Bangkok to Sydney,May 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I purchased a Premium Economy seat and paid for a lie flat bed. Despite attempting to confirm my seats many times prior to departure, when checking in I was told that there are no lie flat beds on this flight. In fact the aircraft is only economy seating. I tried numerous times over a period of one week to contact their staff for a refund. Their chat bot is totally useless so I left messages, tried calling their overseas offices and always received just a voice message to leave a short message with email or phone number. Nothing! It's obvious that they cannot afford proper customer support service or are simply not interested and don't care. I have just checked online again for the same flights in September and they offer economy seats at $327 USD or premium economy at $853 USD. This airline has only one objective, take your money and if you have a problem don't contact us."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kota Kinabalu to Hong Kong,July 2023,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4,no,5," Low cost airline (or more like mid-cost in a post-COVID world) so expectations should be set accordingly but gets you from A to B. Mid-age aircraft, narrow seats and pitch, basic food available for purchase, and minimal service. Premium Flex is a waste of money as no check-in or boarding line-up or luggage priority as promised. Ticket changes or cancellation are painful."

So I booked expecting to be able to add it at the end. Then they wanted to charge 58USD per bag for a 2 hour flight. Then I tried to look up my booking on my AirAisa login and it said I do not have any booking! Then It took a awhile to find the ""other airlines"" bookings. They claim its booked with ""another airline"" not Air Asia. I tried to cancel the booking and their is no way to cancel. There is no email address, no contact number, no chat box. There is an autorobot called Bo, which gives multiple excuses as to why it cannot help you. First it says it timed out, then it said the flight is not with Air Asia but ""another airline"" and they have to check the rules of the other airline then it doesnt get back to you. At the airport, they restricted the baggage to 15kgs instead of 20kgs online and proceeded to charge an extortionate fee for each extra kilo. Then when we checked in they booked all of us including two children aged 9 in different seats all over the plane."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seoul Incheon to Manila,August 2022,,,,,,,2,no,1,"  To be honest, my overall experience with this airline is disappointing. It is a budget airline but due to hidden additional charges, it actually is not a budget one. The most terrible experience is their customer service. You are wasting your time chatting with a chatbot. My tickets were canceled due to Covid last 2020 and 2021. Until now, I did not receive any refund. They just keep on saying the status is in progress and will escalate it. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Singapore via Taipei,July 2023,1.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Worst airline in Asia, in terms of punctuality and service. I have encountered flight cancelled without refund (as nobody answers your queries its just a stupid bot), flight delayed without announcement, they irresponsibly made passengers wait and wait for hour at the boarding gate knowing connecting flight or arrival pick up would be affected. As a passenger, it's very poor management overall which made me concerned about the safety too. They also has a very lousy baggage weighing system that slows everyone down by making passengers repack their duty free into another bag but not necessarily cutting any weight. Price wise is good. But no value as they frequently cancel or delay flight without any refund. They should change their tag line from #everyone can fly To #fly at your own risk."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chiang Mai to Bangkok,November 2022,3.0,3.0,,,,3.0,5,yes,8, I have always found Air Asia over the years to be very clinical.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bali to Labuan,May 2023,3.0,3.0,,,,3.0,2,no,3," Booked 7 flights with AirAsia around 4 months before my holiday. Around 2 month before the flights were supposed to take place the nightmare started. They started to cancel flights for ""technical reasons"" sometimes offering alternatives that were not too bad (same route, just a couple of hours earlier or later), sometimes they offered nothing. In the end of the 7 flights only 2 happened within 1h of the originally booked time. The highlight was a flight that was cancelled and begrudgingly I agreed to their alternative which was 14h earlier. After having re-arranged the other flights this affected, a couple of weeks before the flight, the alternative was moved to within 2h of the original flight's time. Even days before the flights they kept moving them around making my heart sink every time I got a message from AirAsia with the word urgent in the title. Their customer service chatbot is making it impossible to talk to a human or hand in a claim, you just go in circles with it offering you useless options. The positives were that if it was other AirAsia flights that were affected by these cancellations it was pretty painless to move them around and most of the flights were punctual."

The person was in a terrible mood and it showed.  I checked in online and the website told me my check in was incomplete and I needed to check in at the counter. My turn in line came and the person took my passport. He asked for my seat number. I didn’t have it since my online check in was incomplete. We had a little dispute where he mentioned I needed to provide him a seat number and I told him I don’t have it and needed to complete my check in at the counter. I went to the colleague beside him since I just needed my tickets. He told his colleague to stop, asked me to stop wasting other people’s time, and told me to come back over. He eventually printed my tickets. Not to mention my checked in luggage was slightly off symmetrical from the luggage belt. He told me to adjust it. "

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi,May 2023,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Worst airline I’ve ever flown with. I waited over 2 hours on gate K6 for departure however an announcement was made that the plane was delayed over 1 hour which I then waited patiently. 10 minutes before 5pm departure time I get an email stating plane departing from different gate which I headed to and missed the plane with my family and kids. I was then advised to go to level 3 and speak to AirAsia customer service to explain to them and they immediately requested that I pay 870RM as this is a special deal. All I can say is this airline is a total scam, stay away. I did rebook with AirAsia as now they were the only airline flying to Langkawi at 08:55pm however this time the plane was delayed 2.5 hours. Never again!"

Was supposed to fly at 10.00 am, delayed till 12.00 but actually took off at 13.30 hrs from Langkawi. Arrived Singapore 15.00 instead of 11-30 that’s 3.5 hrs late, my connection was 15.10 to Dubai. I left a gap of 3 plus hours for delays but obviously not enough. So cost me a fortune for onwards flight to Dubai and UK. So unreliable only realised when talking to other passengers it’s a common theme. lengthy delays and no show aircraft. Big mistake, will certainly not fly again with this airline."

No apology or explanation in regards to the delay given, neither by gate staff, nor by the pilot. It’s the 2nd time this happened to me within a month, so it seems this has become the norm now. Otherwise uneventful flight."

And if I was able to give this airline a ZERO, I would. Plus this letter is written in behalf of my whole family of 18 who traveled to enjoy our trip to Palawan. On the morning of Sunday, April 23rd 2023, my sister in law pre-checked all of us in online prior to our arrival to the airport which she received an email confirming this check in to show at the counter. At approximately 1130 my family of 18 (included in this number was 7 children) of us traveling arrived at the Palawan Puerto Princesa Airport which was 3 hours prior to our departure back to Cebu Philippines which was around 1430, like everybody is instructed to do before every departure. At the time, they started calling for all passengers to check in their luggage for our flight, we arrived at the counter and my sister in law showed her our pre check in confirmation email. It was an overwhelming experience to our family. The policies and procedure were never clear. As the parting answer of the Manager, that the Pre-checked in option is never a guarantee that you will have a seat. My family and I took a 3 night trip to Palawan from Cebu. I, personally have traveled on numerous different airlines and never have I noticed so much unprofessionalism. And such a disappointment to most of my family members which was their first time ever being on a plane. Even though we had so much of a bad experience with Air Asia there is one police officer that show so much compassion, especially to my wife and sister in law, who were forced to stay back till they found another flight. Never again will we fly Air Asia."

The flight change notification promised a refund or a flight change. I needed to change my flight to a different airport so the agent told me I would need to just book a new flight and they would issue a refund for the original flight. I went ahead and booked the new flight, but never received the refund. I have tried everything I could and this company refuses to speak with me about the issue. I've tried submitting new tickets and cases since I can't get an agent to speak with me and they decline to refund, saying the flight wasn't canceled so it's not eligible for a refund. I have sent screen shots of the e-mail where the refund was promised and they are just ignoring me completely. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Denpasar,March 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Avoid Air Asia at all cost. They cancelled our tickets MNL-DPS-MNL, with less than a month's notice. No other flights to or from Denpasar were available - seems to me like they have stopped flying this route. Obviously, we then had to pay twice as much to repurchase tickets so close to the departure date, and so far, 3 weeks later, we have seen no sign of an Air Asia reimbursement. This company, it turns out, is in significant financial distress (PN17 status in Malaysia), so this must be a symptom of that. Don't risk losing your money with them - Air Asia seems to have gone from hero to zero, unfortunately."

The 1st flight arrived at the destination even earlier than the stated time, and the 2nd one was punctual as well, their cabin crew are all professional, well dressed, respectful and beautiful too! unlike Malaysian Airlines staff which were disrespectful and not good looking, If you're looking for domestic flights within Malaysia, they're the best option to choose imo, don't let the negative reviews scare you away, I bought one 25kg luggage and when I weighed it at the airport, it was 2 kg above that but still they said it was fine and didn't charge anything extra for it."

Pity, it's only 2/3 times a week, usually on Wednesdays and Sundays. The aircraft, staff and service are what you would expect from any AirAsia flight. Efficient and cost-effective.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Sandakan,February 2023,3.0,3.0,,,,3.0,5,yes,10,"  All went quickly and even before time! We were almost late checking our bag, they packed the plane and we landed ahead of time. Cannot complain because it is rare that airlines run their operations ahead of time. No service but we knew about it so no complaints. Point A to point B, all went well. The pilot was very nice informing us when Kota Kinabalu will pop on the horizon, so we were ready and got some great photos of the beautiful mountain. Weather cooperated as well.

Our flight is from Phnom Penh to Colombo via Kuala Lumpur (self check-in in KL). It only gave me itinerary for the flight from Phnom Penh to Kuala Lumpur and only for one traveler, altough there are two of us. While trying to manage our booking, the booking confirmation was sent to a weird and suspicious e-mail and my contact number was removed and changed into a Chinese phone number. After I changed this strange e-mail to my e-mail address, I received the booking confirmation in Chinese only. All this made us very suspicious and we tried to contact AirAsia office with a number from their website. However, the phone operator informed me that this number doesn't exist. We are now not sure what to do."

But  I paid a small amount for the flight, so you pay for what you get. However the customer communication was awful, non existent in real terms. I needed to communicate with airasia about an amount they overcharged me. Their website and Airasia super app will only allow you to navigate a set list of questions and set answers. If your issue is outside those parameters, they are not interested. Their website and super app contains no email address or phone number to contact them about any issue out side the answers in the website. You keep getting directed to a ""bot"" called Ava. I managed to find on the internet 2 email addresses belonging to airasia. The response from both of them was ""not our dept, Ticket closed"". When asked which dept I should email, no reply. This issue has been going on 6 months now, it is not resolved. It is very clear that airasia wants nothing to do with ""actual customers"", I cannot comprehend how a company can still exist providing this non existent customer interaction and non existent customer servicing."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Puerto Princessa to Manila,February 2022,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,1,no,1," Warning: AirAsia booking policies are deceptive! You can search for the best ticket price for a route and think that AirAsia is the lowest, but one page before you pay, AirAsia adds a significant ""processing fee"" without warning such that you cannot compare AirAsia's ticket price to another airline! The only way to check for the accurate ticket price is to go all the way through the booking process and almost purchase the ticket. This is unfair and deceptive! Stay vigilant!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Surat Thani to Bangkok,January 2023,3.0,3.0,,,,4.0,3,no,3,"  At every turn AirAsia try to scalp you for every dollar. Examples such as hoping you forget to check-in online so they can charge you additionally, purposefully allocating seat locations (if purchasing more than one ticket) in different positions on-board so that you're more likely to pay the 600THB (per person) to change seats and waiting to tell you last minute your meal option has been discontinued so you have to pay more to get a different meal. We expect more as consumers and preying on the technologically vulnerable is shameful behaviour."

The flight finally left around 2:30-3:00 Pm for Taipei. At least we still have the flatbed seat we book to relax on the flight. Later on the return trip, the flight was delayed, and during checked in I realised the seat number are not consistent with my booking, so i asked the ground crew about it and was told not to worry as i still have my seat I booked .. it is a lie. We were shocked when we walk into the cabin as the configuration of the plane is different from our booking. there are no flatbed on this plane, up until now, no one have the decency to let me know about this changes. Later during the flight I asked one of the stewardess how to request for a refund for my premium flatbed booking and was told i need to make an online feedback on their website. I make the feedback after on the 3rd day after returning to KL and I didn't receive any email or message reply. last i check i have a RM400+ credit in my account which i assume is from that flight but i am not sure as i never received any response.

Later if I want to add luggage I have to pay exorbitant fees. Next, their flights are never on time and are frequently rescheduled. The staff are unprofessional and uncouth. Even the flight's interior is not clean! They make false claims of allowing free rescheduling but add multiple fees which makes rescheduling ridiculously expensive.

This flight was booked six months ago so that we can leave for Thailand after staying two days in KL. On 12/21/2022, we were notified by AirAsia via email that our flight (AK882) was cancelled due to aircraft downsize and we were re-scheduled to leave KL at 6.50am the next day (12/25/2022). Out of curiosity, we did an online search and we saw AirAsia still have other flights available from KL to Bangkok on 12/24/2022, but with higher ticket price, so we contact AirAsia support via chat and tell them that we have to be in Bangkok on 12/24 for our vacation activities and hoped they could re-schedule us to the same day flights. To our surprise, the support staff were not helpful at all by keeping on saying ""no, we don't have any seat available for flights on 12/24"". We ended up rebooking our flight with Malaysia Airlines to fly to Bangkok on 12/24. We are still awaiting the refunds for the canceled flight from AirAsia. "

I travelled with my friends and I wasn't checked in, whereas my friends were. On being asked why, the guy at the counter said that the plane was downsized and there were no more seats! Just think of that! My ticket was already booked and confirmed way back in October. We wasted more than one hour trying to convince the guy to give me a ticket but to no avail. Finally after giving the an ultimatum, he finally checked me in, and can you believe it, there were 7 unoccupied seats on the plane. I'll never recommend Air Asia."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Jakarta to Bangkok,November 2022,2.0,2.0,,,,2.0,2,no,1," AirAsia cancelled / postponed my flight and allowed for one time change of schedule for free and this is all done through their chatbot called AVA. however, I made a mistake by choosing wrong departure date, this isn't fixable by their chatbot, but I found a way to actually get in touch with real human customer service through the chat service. Had to wait for an hour of 200 people queuing, when it finally my chance, I wrote my inquiries and they just disconnected without answer. It happened TWICE. Like what other reviewers said, be careful with customer service of this airline, as it is basically non existent. Not reachable by phone either. They will either let you speak with a chatbot or refer you to a human agent that just don't care and disconnect you at will."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Phuket via Kuala Lumpur,December 2022,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2,no,2," Check in was easy, both flights were on time and luggage arrived without incident. That was the best of it. Every announcement was screamed at us in multiple languages. They woke the whole plane up with 2.5hrs to go (scheduled landing at 0330hrs) so they could serve breakfast to about three passengers. You can't bring water on board, and you pay for it on the plane. The passengers were generally pushy and rude. KLIA is a filthy dump and we will avoid flying Air Asia again to ensure we don't have to transit there in future."

My flights were rescheduled to the next day but I was not notified. I turned up at the airport to find out my flight wouldn’t be until the next day. Air Asia blamed kiwi.com and kiwi.com blamed Air Asia. I was not offered any compensation for the lost accommodation fees or expensive Uber to the airport, nothing. Neither Air Asia or kiwi.com would accept any responsibility. I hate to think what would’ve happened if I had a connecting flight. Do not book through Air Asia or kiwi.com, it’s not worth the trouble."

After having had a few bad experience with Malaysia airlines quite recently. I chose Air Asia for the value of money. On Christmas day, flight was on time. Check in at the airport was orderly, premium flex customers perks and priority were observed. Boarding by the zone was very orderly also. Plane is clean and crew were lovely and welcoming. It really pays to get the exit row for the extra leg room and comfort. My pre-ordered meal of Bukhara chicken rice was delicious ad spicy, and it came with a small bottle of water. I was impressed at how efficient the crew worked, and they kept the 2 toilets clean at regular intervals as well. Landing was so smooth too. Luggage delivered in a timely manner and in good condition. For someone who is used to flying premium airlines in business class, I must say this was a very inoressive experience. I think in future for medium to short haul flights, I really don't mind to fly with them and save some money as well. Maybe party is also because, nowadays, many premium airlines cut costs so much that, more and more, they resemble budget airlines, except for the price tag."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Miri,December 2022,,,,,,,2,no,1,"  I like Air Asia for been a good low cost airlines. But when you have an issue, the problem are starting and you will find nobody at the end for a solution or at least an answer. Air Asia changed the flight schedule by 5 hours and this was not compatible with my holidays. So I asked for a refund on Dec 2. On Dec 16, I went through the long and inefficient talk with robot AVA until I get in the queue for a human agent with n°90. After an hour, I got an answer: your refund will be done in 2 days. On Dec 20, after playing again with AVA for half an hour, I was granted to the queue with number 144. And after 2 questions, the chat was terminated by the agent or ? and I still not get and answer. But every time the claim case was solved. I guess this is a great satisfaction for Air Asia to close claims, without answering their customer. In fact AVA was better than the agent, but both are inefficient. So I gave up with AVA, and called the phone voicemail service for Air Asia Thailand. I explained my case and  after 24 hours still waiting for a call back when it should have been done in 24 hours. But for urgent case I can contact AVA: joke. Form this experience, I notice that the customer service at Air Asia is non-existent, but also when you consider the price of the ticket (must check everything: seat, luggage, food), Air Asia is no more advantageous compare to a normal airlines like Malaysia Airlines or Thai. And for a small difference of the fare you can talk to a real agent instead of a stupid robot and incompetent agents. For the future I will be careful before booking at AirAsia, since this company reschedule and cancel flights many times since the start of COVID and the new normal."

At least 8 hours later. The explanation was bad weather. There was rain and also i heart thunder. But in the 8 hours we waited and had to sleep at the airport other airplanes flew. So it felt like there must be another option then to let us wait so long at mid night at an AirPort. We also had to beg for some food and drinks, which we eventually got, but it was not offered from first hand. Also no hotel was offered."

After addressing this to the staff, you're just referred back to the kiosk and after insisting it won't work, finally being referred to a counter to drop off your luggage. At waiting your turn at the counter, the completely uninterested ground staff member simple wanted to refer me back to the kiosk again even after i've stated it didn't work. When i insisted she mentioned her counter was for checking inn cabin crew only, it was clearly she was lying as other passengers were checked by her before. In the end i got another staff member involved who told the lady behind the counter to actually assist me, after which my bag was checked in smoothly within 3 minutes. in the meantime many agitated passengers encountered the same frustrating experience! I truly don't understand why an airline would tolerate such rude and indifferent behavior. I've filled a complaint with AirAsia about this, but i only received an automated answer and the day after an email saying my case was closed (with no information given or anything). Flying with AirAsia? Never again for me."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Singapore,November 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  We arrived 1.5 hours before our flight. Most of the kiosks were broken and we were sent to 4 different counters by the Air Asia staff.  After we finally made it to the front of the line to drop off our bags they refused to take our bags telling us we were too late. The lady at counter V16 was extremely rude and began criticizing me for not hearing her over the speaker system about the last call for dropping off our bags. I explained to her that we did not hear her because we were being shuffled around by their staff from counter to counter. She replied by telling me that she didn’t believe that I didn’t hear her and continued to criticize me further. She took zero accountability for their incompetent staff. We ended up missing our flight and had to rebook another flight. Later I returned to her counter to get her name so I could file a report but the staff acted dumb and told me they didn’t know her name. I then asked to speak to a supervisor and was told it was his day off?! None of the staff members wear name tags. We will never travel AirAsia again!

I subsequently received an email from AirAsia on 15 October telling me that my flights were cancelled due to 'Operational reasons'. A promise is made for the refund to be made in 30 days. Now more than a month later, the refund is still in progress and no further advisories to enlighten me the status .... except from what I see in my account on their website. AirAsia has no customer service, no customer service phone number, not even an email address. All they have is an online chatbot named AVA, which is worse than useless. So you are on your own should any problems arise after you confirm your booking. Will definitely avoid flying AirAsia if I had a choice."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok,November 2022,3.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  The worst airline I have ever dealt with. They would not allow me to book a pre-flight bag and then charged me $80 for a bag that was slightly overweight (10 kilos). I had no choice but to pay as I was on the way to the flight. They were totally disinterested in helping. Terrible experience all around.

And I tried to do this, in the process to change it seems it doesn’t work and I get no confirmation email of the change. But so I find out they make up a new email which I have to register with on airasia website or some bullshit! So the ticket was changed and when it was time to check in for this flight, I also didn’t see any email to my own email and I lost my flight.

There was an accident with one of the passengers, help was provided late and because AirAsia are not providing stickers with the passenger details to the bags etc.. it took another 30-40 mins to find the bag of the passenger that was removed from the flight. Everyone was shocked and panicked, when I requested water after an accident it wasn’t provided, you have to buy it! Just ridiculous! Flight was 3 hours + and with all the delays we were in the airplane for more than 4-5 hours! Customer service is as low as it could be. Not talking about how uncomfortable and tight the seats was."

However, in reality is 10 days before. They should make the correction. Flight return from Krabi to Kuala Lumpur, most of the inflight meal was sold out. Cabin crew mentioned only left “ Nasi Lemak option”. When they make this announcement flight already on sky of Selangor. I don’t know what the purpose they make announcement of food sold out when the flight prepare for landing. They should bring more food since they notice no restaurant operate in international terminal. A320 Neo seat is suck. Not comfortable."

This is coming from a loyal customer during pre-pandemic days. This airline unfortunately never recovered from the pandemic. Both sectors (inbound and outbound flights) were delayed by more than 1.5 hours. Finally landed in the domestic terminal and was ushered by a bus to go to international, before walking all the way to immigration, and then had to wait for luggage.

We had a layover in Kuala Lumpur and when it was time to board no wheelchair, and a long ramp and then she had to climb stairs anyway. When we arrived in Danang again no wheelchair.

So I waited. After half an hour the flight got delayed another time to 6.40 pm. Isn't this ridiculous? We need to be there 2 hours before departure and the flight is delayed than 2 hours. I for one did not have enough currency to buy any food  and I was like super hungry.. by the time I reached KL I was starving.  This was a very bad experience for me. The cabin crew was so unfriendly, never even greet the customers when they enter, busy talking to themselves."

We purchase the tickets suits our occasions but what happen always are rescheduling the flight, over delay and frequently change gates. Due to delay and rescheduling, I can’t attend my event. At least for not disappointing please provide some complimentary drinks for making your customers to wait for so long. Please be responsible on the schedule that advertising initially. After all this is low fare airline not free airline so please respect your customer’s time since we are purchasing tickets too. This is not fair at all where if we as a customer if late for few minutes, will the airline wait for us, no right, so again I’m telling that please respect your customer’s time."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cebu to Bangkok via Manila,September 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,2,no,2,"  Booking for onward flights were correct, there was enough time to connect in Manila. Then the airline issued a ticket under i0ne booking number and mention connection guaranteed by carrier. Booking for return flight did not alert on any issue for connection. The connecting tine (1 hour and 20 minutes) was too short for immigration formalities and taxi to next place for connecting flight. I tried to reach customer service. After hours waiting for agent i got a brief message: the company had issued 2 booking codes (one for each segment of the itinerary) so it could not guarantee the connection. I had to buy another ticket for the connecting flight, 3 hours later, to be sure I would have time to go through immigration and to take a taxi to go to departure place for connecting flight. AirAsia should not show connecting flights with too short time to connect. It should show flights with at least 3 hours for connection, or it should inform client, when booking a Bangkok to Cebu flight that client will need at least 3 hours for immigration plus transport to second place for connecting flight. It is unfair to let client book and pay flight with insufficient connecting time and then tell client ""Sorry there is nothing we can do, yes you are likely to miss the connecting flight, you should buy a new ticket for a later flight"".

When I contacted Customer service to raise my concern, they agreed to move her to a seat close by. But then at airport check in, I couldn't print boarding pass. Was told to go to payment counter and pay for changing my daughter's seat! After escalation, the manager even accused me of putting my daughter in a far away seat but now wants to move her closer, hence I should pay. I find her accusation so ridiculous. She finally agreed to waive seat charge, as though she did me a favor. I wonder why AirAsia system would assign young kids to sit by themselves.  My advise. Go with another airline!"

I am now being told I get no refund if I don't fly on it because it would be a 'voluntary' cancellation, and it will cost over $320 dollars more to rebook to a later flight on the same day. I thought maybe after covid the terrible travel services would cease, but I guess Air Asia does not care. Shocking treatment."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Phuket,September 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1," Had a flight from Bangkok to Osaka cancelled during COVID. They gave a partial refund but the rest remained as a voucher.  However, using the voucher is next to impossible. In March I wanted to go to Krabi but the voucher didn't work. I contacted the airline and explained the problem but they were so slow in responding that I ran out of time and had to book flights at a higher price and without the discount vouchers. When they finally got back to me they asked for my information and then I never heard from them again and they closed the enquiry without informing me. I'm trying to use the vouchers for another trip. I'm about a week away from when I need to fly and I still haven't been able to book flights because their customer service is so awful. I contacted them months ago via email (after they hung up on me on the phone twice!) and they asked me for my information again. They have so far confirmed that I have vouchers but haven't given me any way to use them either during booking or after booking. Once again I've waited so long that the flights I wanted have disappeared and I'll now be paying a higher price for flights I didn't want. The only way to contact them now is though their terrible online chat which never understands my question. I've managed to get in an online queue but I'm number 99 and have moved one place in about 30 minutes. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Jakarta to Medan,September 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I booked this flight on August and AirAsia cancelled it so I had to reschedule. Then when finally came the travel time and I arrived at 7am at the Jakarta station, they told me that the flight to Medan has been rescheduled again this morning for 6pm so around 9 hours later. This was already bad because I booked a trip in Medan so I couldn't make it on time. And I didn't even receive any email or notification about rescheduling. Then around 3pm I got another email saying that the flight has been rescheduled for 1am of the next day. 5 min later I got another message saying the flight has been rescheduled for 1:50am. So 4 times rescheduled, together 16 hours of delay. They gave us ridiculously low amount of money as an excuse. When I started to think about a refund and I tried to book another flight at the same day with another company, AirAsia said that I won't get any refund because I rejected it. Which I did not, they told me about the refund and I said that I have to think about it. "

There was a 7.5-hour change of time, so I decided to cancel my ticket and receive a refund. I couldn't see any option to contact a member of staff, other than a bot on the AirAsia website. Since submitting my claim, I haven't received any correspondence from AirAsia. Luckily, it was a really cheap flight and I can take the loss. I certainly wouldn't book with AsiaAir again because I just wouldn't want to be placed in a similar situation. "

Over 3 weeks later and I am still waiting to understand if I will receive a refund. Will never book with AirAsia again."

The process took so long and no customer service available anywhere to give your complaint directly.

I go to the other gate explain, they say it’s my fault because I didn’t go to the live checkin. And had I done the online checkin properly I would have seen. This is the text on the online ticket: ""you may proceed directly to the gate using this e-boarding pass"". The employee said there were tickets available the same day, but until I admitted it was my fault he would not give me one for today but instead for tomorrow.

The officer said to try again in 5 minutes and the same result kept coming up until 15 minutes had passed and now the result became ""too late to board"". The officer told me to go to the service counter and they kept sending me to different service counters until I reached the rudest lady who initially told me that I can't board within 20 minutes of take off, even though I was at the gate 35 minutes before take off. I kept begging her to help me but all she said was ""please step aside, sir. I'm busy"". That was 5 minutes prior to the supposed take off and of course I missed the flight. After all of this I had to go retrieve the bags I checked in and that took over 20 minutes, at which time I found out the flight had been delayed by 40 minutes. I have to wait for the delayed flight to depart before I can take back my checked in bags. What kind of customer service is this? Also I was informed that they may help me with rescheduling the flight if I pay the difference even though 1 AirAsia employee told me it was the system's fault."

But when i went to the airport it was not reflected on the system and they said I was not checked in and as such cannot check in anymore as counter is closed. The only solution was to buy a new air ticket.

It is never okay to retime flights to another time because if it was, then I would have bought the ticket at that time and not the one that I choose. Airasia has no customer service whatsoever. A useless robot is not customer service. Airasia also practices Excessively draconian rules on baggage weight as if an extra 1kg of carry on baggage.

Tried to change flights due to a visa issue but the only form of interaction is with AVA - an auto-bot with limited information. I have been trying to reschedule for over 2 hours now without any success. This is tantamount to fraud and scam - AirAsia is essentially robbing us of our money. I will never book through AirAsia again. If the airline is unable to provide an adequate customer service, the whole outfit should just close shop or sell to a party better able to run the airline. What a waste of money!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Jakarta,July 2022,,,,,,,2,no,1,"  I ordered my round-way tickets months in advance, only for them to say my return flight will be canceled one week before the actual flight. I needed to talk to someone to get more detail about the process, but no human is available as their system is now only a bot.  The system offered to move my return flight to another day but none of the proposed timing fit my schedule, so I asked for a refund. I was given a pending case confirmation, without any detail whatsoever on the refund processing.  Since I couldn’t get any clarity, I decided to go down to the airport counter and asked some questions to the ground staff at the AirAsia counter.  She checked and confirmed the refund request was actually for both depart and return tickets, something that is not made clear in the bot chat. The ground staff could not void my refund request as this has to be done by AirAsia and not the airport staff. I had thought that the refund was only going to be for my return ticket but I had lost both tickets. Because of this, they couldn’t guarantee that I will still have my name in the booking system on my departure date. The ground staff said there’s nothing that can be done on their side as they have no way to reach AirAsia. Basically, I need to book another ticket which is way more expensive now that I have so little time left before my flight. So before you book your tickets think twice. It could just be a stroke of bad luck on my side, but I’m reading so many reviews that are similar to mine and they help solidify why I will never book from this airline ever again."

Flights from KL to Langkawi delayed. I received an email whilst at the airport getting ready to check in saying delayed. My original return flight from Langkawi to KL was cancel and we were bumped back over 2 hrs to a later flight. Then that flight was delayed after we checked in. Then to add insult to injury, the Air Asia flight going to KL that was scheduled for a later departure ended up flying out before my earlier flight. Then if you try to lodge a complaint about the service it is all virtual response now. Seriously such lousy service and terrible airline. I truly regret booking with Air Asia.

I eventually got to talk with a so-called live agent (had to wait in queue for 3 hours) that pretended he was typing (the 3 dots pre-message symbol showed up for like 5 minutes) and eventually the conversation ""expired"". I came to understand that the flight they sold me (AK 857) doesn't operate on Sundays. I have another ticket bought from them, for the 25th August (Thursday), from KL to Krabi (AK 868) and I already checked Flightaware and found out that the flight only operates on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. I asked for a refund for the flight that got cancelled by AirAsia, but so far I haven't got my money back and from the looks of it, I'm understanding that the same situation will arise with the KL to Krabi flight. Don't trust AirAsia flights and always check on several sites if the flights actually exist and operate on the days they are selling them."

Check in under staffed, no social distance control and rude ground staff. We booked a flight together but when we got our tickets they put us in Seat A and C with gap of middle seat. They told me the flight was full and we had no choice. I pointed out that no one likes to sit in the middle seat, so why not give them the window or aisle, so we as a couple are together. They were rude and says that's our allocated tickets. We will never travel AirAsia again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Singapore,June 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,2,no,1,"  Purchased baggage in advance with tickets. Tried to luggage drop exactly an hour before flight time at 11.25am which was stated as 12.25pm. System error stating late. Went to the counter, and was told to queue. Spoke to a couple of other passengers and noticed they are the same flight as me, and machine also stated late and hence unable to luggage drop despite them being there way earlier than 1hr before departure. When queue reaches our turn, its 11.45pm. Counter customer service stated too late, cannot luggage drop. We were told to wait for this flight to depart first, then try to request customer service for change to another flight and pay the difference. That sounds ridiculous because the other passengers are ""late"" because AirAsia's own ticketing system has a problem and everyone was asked to queue until they missed the closing time for dropping luggage. I gave my luggage to my wife who drove me here and ran all the way to the departure gate. I arrived at the departure gate at 12.10pm. On the way, custom informed me that system shows I cannot board but I can try. Tried I did. To my surprise, the plane is not there yet at the departure gate when I arrived. This means Airaasia could have helped, but they simply refuse. When I tried to reason to the counter at the departure gate, all I get told was I was late. There is no sense of logic in the heads of these customer service agents. In any case, it is now 1.25pm whilst typing this review. 60 minutes delayed with no notice on estimated delay duration. There are the elderly, and kids here and they just don't seem to be bothered. When queried what is the policy for flight delay and possible cancellation, he says 2 hours first, then denies saying it back and forth. Very unprofessional and unreliable customer service. The flight status board now shows another flight, and my flight just simply gets removed without notice, causing alot of passengers crowding at the desk asking what is going on. For reference, we take AirAsia because it is cheaper sometimes. So we understand and do not complaint if it delays a little here and there. However, the customer service is poor beyond reasoning even after taking into account the slightly cheaper rates."

Absolutely apathetic ground crew, and there is zero understanding of customer service concept. You get what you pay for - cheap airlines, cheap service, and I would never have taken this airline except that it was the only direct flight to Bali. Other airlines are twice as expensive, and glad to spend that money to interact with humans. Air Asia service is like a glorified AI BOT."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Singapore,May 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,2,no,1," Disappointing flight. I haven’t flown AirAsia for some time and seems like it’s punctuality and service have gone downhill. The flight was delayed by 2 hours. I wasn’t informed when I checked in at the airport despite at that point the preceding flights were delayed so they should have been aware. Still no apology for being late when they stated they were ""boarding"" which they stated before the preceding flight had started to disembark. An hour after ""boarding"" they finally opened up the doors for us to get on. Still no apology, little checking of peoples tickets. Once we get on the plane it’s pretty clear they haven’t even done a cursory clean which is pretty shocking given the lessons of covid. KL T2 is not a great airport to be stuck in past the security barriers for over 2 hours. So if your flying Air Asia I recommend double checking your flight status before doing that. Or just don’t fly AirAsia and maybe you won’t have the same risk of long delays and poor service."

More than half of my flight got cancelled / rescheduled to the inconvenient time. I need to rearrange my schedule and travel plan because of that. There is no proper way to complain as you will always be directed to AVA which can't settle your issue most of the time. Questions never be answered and customer service is basically not exist. Undeniable it offers the most affordable flight ticket but with the inconvenience caused by frequent reschedule/ cancellation and the worst customer service, it is not worthy of it."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Denpasar,May 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  We have had a terrible experience with Air Asia. Three weeks before our flights, we received notification that they had cancelled both of our flights for operational reasons. We were automatically rebooked on flights - one of which was an entire day later than our initial itinerary. We couldn't miss the day of work, so attempted to get a refund or credit for that fllight. Absolutely no ability to contact a human, and everything was done through the chat bot - except that the bot was obviously incapable of understanding the situation. We explicitly said we needed a refund for one flight. In the meantime, we booked quickly with another airline (at substantial out of pocket cost). Instead? No refund, but they credited both flights which meant that we now no longer had any route to our destination! We also can't rebook the original AirAsia flight because the price has quadrupled. Absolutely no customer service or assistance. We are left with three lots of flights we can't use, a substantial amount of out of pocket cost, and no apology."

No compensation, nothing. Front desk did not even tell me I would not get on the same flight. Why overbook a flight during a major holiday? Why do customers just get pushed to any flight they want without prior notice nor without compensation? I’ve travelled with other budget airlines and this is just the worst. Also, customer service is bad. I can’t even file a complaint. Front desk says all complaints need to go through their online chat Ava. Well, Ava is not human and doesn’t understand simple keywords like “refund” and “compensation”. The worst."

I have regularly tried to follow this up since then, each time being told to be patient. I have not been able to contact them since October last year and my last communication said that they could not find the booking number!

I lodged a case for refund with AirAsia thru their online chat bot, as I couldn't contact any of their customer service staff. My case status was closed by AirAsia, and I haven't get my refund back. I went to the airport to check with their counter staff, they said AirAsia have refunded me. I checked with my bank, and there are not a single dime from AirAsia.  There are no way to contact their person in charge for refund. The boarding counter staffs tell you to lodge your case online with the chatbot. You can spend 2 hours and get nowhere there."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Hua Hin to Chiang Mai,April 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  An abysmal customer service experience. Trying to reach a person for help is nearly impossible, they force you to communicate solely via chat with an automated bot that is of very little help. If you are persistent, you can get through to what they lead you to believe is a human but I have my doubts. They have no interest in attempting to retain a customer in any way shape or form, the default answer is no. I was unable to make a booked flight due to rapidly changing travel plans during Covid times. I hoped I could get some kind of credit for booking another flight but they were unwilling to consider the option, which is certainly their right for the fare booked. One would figure they may have some kind of repeat customer loyalty flexibility or the ability to provide any shred of empathy, but that is clearly not the case. Lesson learned, avoid this airline at all costs."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Malaysia to Singapore,March 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Absolutely horrendous. Don’t bother flying with AirAsia. I bought my ticket on Trip.com. I was denied boarding at the check-in counter by AirAsia, who claimed that I had cancelled my ticket on Trip.com and was already given a full refund. None of that is true. This is a non-refundable and exchangeable ticket to begin with. My ticket was still valid. I was not allowed to check in and was given zero information on what’s going on. Trip.com has confirmed with me there are no refund applications made and I should be allowed to fly. I was informed by Trip.com the next day that AirAsia had rescheduled my flight for the weekend. However, I do not have any ticket issued by AirAsia and no confirmation from them. I have emailed them but received no response. I have queued for over an hour on their online customer service chat support but was kicked out of the queue because ""the line is too busy"". Trip.com do not have any tickets confirmation either and this entire thing is a question mark. I’m just stuck in Malaysia Kuching right now with no answers, horrible service and attitude from AirAsia and a big hole in my wallet for all the money spent. AirAsia had already delayed my flight by 2 days before this situation happened. I had already rebooked and paid for another hotel, and took another pre-departure Covid test again. Now I’m faced with this question mark and likely have to spend more money and time. This will be my last time flying with AirAsia. Do not even bother to consider them. It’s not worth the supposedly low-ticket prices. You need to do something AirAsia."

All you do is talk to a bot tried email no reply only phone number person said they don’t do it and wouldn’t give another number or any help. Left comments on their FB no reply and currently AirAsia doesn’t fly to Ho Chi Minh so can’t even go to airport to talk to a ticket agent. The office they had closed two years ago so right now I literally can’t talk to a human to get a refund. Will just have to kiss the money goodbye, I will never use this company again, why would anyone considering if you have any problems of any kind you can’t talk to a customer service rep. Obviously this company has major financial problems."

Tried to get refund from AirAsia, discovered no other options except to use it's AVA robotic chat, which was not really user-friendly, and persistently keeps pushing credit rather then cash refund, I persisted, finally left on queue for agent chat, waited approx 45mins, suddenly AVA says not available, call back later! Called back later, waited another 1hr15mins, agent came on, says AA don't give cash refund even if AA cancels flights and copy pasted bits of their t&C's all over chat with link. I followed link to AA's full t&C's, which gave three options when flights are cancelled, and option C clearly stated; full refund to the bank account. So I pointed this out to agent, and copy pasted that paragraph in chat for her perusal. Agent replied; doesn't apply to domestic flights. I asked her to please show me where that is stated as I can't see it mentioned. Agent rudely left chat. I've always used AirAsia prior to this incident but now, I must say I find AirAsia unprofessional unethical business acumen is deplorable, and the unnecessarily rude attitude and rather childish mannerism of its agent totally unwarranted and uncalled for."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Osaka to Manila,March 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  The airline keeps cancelling flight especially when the flight date is near. This is without regard to the trouble the passenger will have in rescheduling work leave, rebooking local flight in country of destination, and the expenses of finding another flight from other airlines because their (AirAsia) new flight date will come after 1 month. This happens when COVID cases are already going down and the restrictions already eased, especially in the destination country. The only explanation they can give is ""this normally happens""."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chiang Mai to Phuket,December 2021,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," I travelled in Thailand with AirAsia, and this time was my worst experience ever. First, they cancelled my flight 3 times. Every time it was a few days before the flight, it cost me more than $300. They've always refused to refund me. You have to know that when you want to get a refund, no ""real customer service"". You can chat with a bot (which is totally dysfunctional) that always repeats the same garbage. Many people have been waiting for more than one year, never saw they money back. Second, some of their practices are very dubious. When I booked my flight, it was written ""check bag included"". But when I printed the ticket, I discovered it wasn't and the employee fined me for my luggage (more than 200 USD) because according to the company, it wasn't ""included"". Actually, when I ordered on their platform, the luggage were included, but the ticket they sent me didn't correspond to reality. I met other travelers when I was queuing up who had the same problem and were fined as well. (No refund/no exchange is possible). To conclude, you should stay away from this low-cost company which has no respect for their customers. They won't hesitate to cancel your flight, charge you extra fees and never refund you. It might be better to take a more expensive company, but more respectful toward consumers."

In January 2019 I purchased six tickets from Manila to Cebu and back. When I arrived in Manila, March 2019 you canceled our flights. I have been 2 years trying to get my money back. I have gone through everything that you wanted me to. I have given you all of the information and I have contacted you hundreds of times. I have had conversations with your useless staff. I have given you bank account information to deposit the money that you took within minutes when I purchased the ticket and yet you cannot give me a refund. I have photographs of all of these conversations as well as a photograph of the policy that you had when I purchased my tickets. And that is that if you canceled my flight I was entitled to a full refund to the exact form of payment used to buy the tickets. I have pictures of your agent saying that I should have a refund. You cheat people out of their hard-earned money. We purchased our tickets in good faith and you did not provide the service. There are thousands like me. "

Our refund request was validated. However, we still haven't received the refund. All other flights - different airlines - have refunded our money. A few weeks ago, there was light at the end of the tunnel - at least, we thought so - as we received an e-mail in which we were asked to provide our bank details so that we could finally get back our money. Note: it was explicitly stated that we had to reply within 7 days, which is odd as AirAsia does not reply to us at all. I have been trying to get in touch with an actual human-being for over a year now. Facebook, website chat, WhatsApp, all you get is AVA the chat bot. I provide them with my case number, my personal details and all I get is 'I am sorry, we could not find your details in our system', which is complete lies. I understand that the world has changed due to COVID, but all organizations seem to have adapted by now. I simply want to speak to a human-being to ask them about my refund request. Sure thing, I will never fly again with AirAsia. Short-term thinking, AirAsia."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Caticlan to Manila,July 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Flight for March 2020 was changed and they offered us a refund which we accepted. Wasn’t a cancelled flight to do with covid or anything. It’s now been three months since I gave my bank details and was told my refund was validated and still don’t have the money back, 15 months since the flight. Also since this point it has been impossible to speak to a human being. Emails sent to addresses we once got replies on are being ignored, they have stopped responding to Twitter DMs. Their chatbot is the biggest waste of time and energy. It eventually gives you a choice to provide feedback and that someone will contact you back during work hours only for you to fill it all out and then be told it cannot be completed due to overwhelming volume. When we check the case status it says in progress despite being told it was validated in March 2021. Other airlines refunded within weeks. We’ve been waiting 15 months. I will never fly with Air Asia for as long as I live. When we were getting responses from “customer service representatives” we were met with hostility or else overly polite apologies which mean absolutely nothing to people such as us who are left out of pocket.  Having the audacity to make it impossible to even speak with a human is disgusting. "

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Chiang Mai,April 2021,,,,,1.0,,1,no,1,"  Air Asia cancelled my flight (this seems to be more and more common with them), but did not refund the money to my credit card account. They have stopped providing any general call center services - there are no phone numbers. Instead, there is only a bot controlled chat function (online or app) that limits your ability to request anything except what they want you to request. No access to a real person. After a couple of glitches involving the bot, it finally found my records and transferred the refund to my member ""credit account."" Supposedly, within a limited amount of time, the credit can be used to buy another ticket from Air Asia. But there seems to be strings attached. I'll never use Air Asia again unless there is no other option. "

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Jakarta,July 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,  Air Asia cancelled my flights 3 times and refused to refund me after 6 months and offer me credits. By refusing to refund customers for cancelled flights is as good as cheating customers of their money.
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Da Nang to Kuala Lumpur,March 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Air Asia are an awful company with zero customer service. If only I’d looked at the reviews before booking. They make promises to refund cancelled flights but these refunds never arrive. It’s impossible to speak to anyone and the automated chat is worse than useless and just takes you round in circles. I finally got a response on twitter and a promise of a refund. This was then turned into a “credit account” and now nobody will respond. A credit account is useless as I wouldn’t go anywhere near Air Asia in the future. They’ve actually profited from covid as they’ve neither provided a flight or refund, which is disgraceful behaviour."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chiang Mai to Hong Kong,February 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1," My flight was cancelled by Air Asia due to restrictions caused by Covid in February 2020. I have been waiting since that time (eight months and counting) for a refund, as is Air Asia's legal obligation. AA have renegued multiple times in promises to repay me in that time. Now, despite not receiving a cent in refund, my case according to Air Asia, is now 'closed'. This is to inform Air Asia, that while the amount of money I have lost is not life changing, I think I speak for thousands of other former passengers cheated out of funds by you when I say that I will do everything in my power to never fly AA again. You may be desperate to stay in business but you have no right to effectively steal funds from passengers. I sincerely hope Air Asia goes bankrupt. "

I was then emailed in May to say I could have a credit account! Replied saying are you having a laugh! No thank you! Since then I have messaged every other day via their Twitter account as this is the only way I can contact them. No phone number, no email address an infuriating automated system that tells you nothing and solves nothing. Each time I am told that my refund is in the final stage and will be back in my account shortly and nothing appears! I am a nurse in the UK and was due to go and see my dad who lives in Manila with my family. It’s bad enough that our 3 week holiday was cancelled, this is just rubbing salt in the wound! £500 of my hard earned money that they were quick enough to take is still not back with me! I couldn’t be angrier. Their customer service is seriously sub standard and I would not recommend anyone to use this company! Modern day robbery at its finest. Would be giving 0/10 if allowed, but has to begrudgingly be a 1/10! Seriously, avoid this company like the plague."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Kalibo,July 2020,,,,,,,2,no,1,"  aCovid happened and the world went into meltdown, flight cancelled and I wanted a refund -  what an awful awful process. Never known anything like it. Cant speak to anyone, and the virtual assistant is just infuriating (possibly the worst one I have ever used) sends you round in circles, no option for live chat and doesnt seem to learn. Obviously its all done to put you off claiming a refund. As for live chat, well you will wait literally hours for a person to come back to you, if at all. Genuinely the worst customer service I have ever received. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Tokyo to Kuala Lumpur,July 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  My flight was canceled because of COVID. Because them canceling they have to offer the refund option. They try in so many ways to give a credit and they customer support is non-existent, they only have robot AVA that is instructed not let you talk to a real person. In the end I got a case number for a refund that would take 12+ weeks to process. Two weeks ago they tried again and sent an email with the cryptic message ""If we don't fail to hear from you within 14 days we will process a credit"" (whatever that ""if we don't fail"" means). I replied by email and of course no confirmation. I will never ever use Air Asia again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Singapore,August 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1," On 1 Aug 2020, I purchased a flight ticket from AirAsia. On 15 Aug 2020, AirAsia cancelled my flight and refuses to refund. They only offered credits. Everyone knows the credit is worthless. In AirAsia's audit report, EY has highlighted there is material uncertainty over AirAsia's going concern status (i.e. AirAsia might become bankrupt within the next year). If AirAsia goes bust, all credits are almost certain to be worthless! To AirAsia: You cannot open a flight, take our money, then cancel the flight to keep the money! This is unethical! As much as you need cash, you cannot do this!!! You've might have gotten my money now, but I will never fly AirAsia again, even after this pandemic!"
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Taipei,April 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1," You will not get a refund at all.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chiang Mai to Kolkata via Bangkok,April 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Don't accept the credit. Cancelled my flight and offered a refund (pre-covid). Since then they have tried to convince me to accept a credit instead and they have stalled with giving me my refund. They were only 20$ cheaper for this trip compared to another company that I was supposed to fly another leg of my trip with. And that company has already given me my money back months ago because Airasia cancelled this part of the trip. If you accept the credit you change the terms of your initial deal and you are now subject to their new terms. By not accepting the credit they are still obligated to the conditions of your initial contract. You can demand your money back through the bank that handled the transaction. You can demand the money back through the card company if you paid via Visa, Mastercard etc. "

So i requested for a refund. In the beginning, it is voluntary, and then it is a credit account request and finally, it is refund back to original payment. So I have chosen credit account while the refund back to original payment is not available at this time. Soon when refund back to original becomes available, i raised refund case again. Then i have contacted them many times to advised them i only need the last case progress, and they said: ""don't worry, we will process the latest case under your account."" Then they choose to refund back to the account, not original payment method, and now refused to refund back to the original payment method."

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Osaka to Singapore,April 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Horrible service from AirAsia. For the past 1 month, i've been trying to get a refund for my flight because of the pandemic. I've tried to reach out to them through their website, but i just keep getting redirected to their online chat bot AVA. Problem is AVA doesn't resolve anything, and it's buggy. I resorted to contacting them on Twitter, but that was not helpful at all as well. They would give you a reply, and proceed to not reply you for another week. It's always being picked up by another customer service agent, so they always ask the same few starting questions. Nothing gets resolved or moved on at all."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur,April 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,  Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur booked for 29th April. It's the pandemic right now so I wanted to reach out and ask if I could change my flight date then through their customer service line they said to reach them through twitter or Facebook so fine. Used twitter instead because Facebook was irresponsive last time used. Dropped a text no response now great it passed 48 hours in changing went there to change it counter was close it's before 5pm but I'd understand the pandemic. No resources online to reach out to anyone to change and it seems like this ticket is going to burn cause it doesn't give much of an option. Not going to use this airline again
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur,April 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Received a notification that my flight to KL is cancelled. However I have another domestic flight from KL to Kota Baru so I wanted that they cancel the other flight as well (cause if I cancel myself refund would be different) and they refund me instead of a credit note. Have called India call center - useless - there is no number for flights outside Asia, chat bot is a machine that doesn't understand any of the specificities of my case of course, customer service just doesn't exist, facebook account has no-one on the other end either, no customer service person on linked. I am appalled and shall never use that airline again if they don't refund me."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Bali,April 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,  Singapore to Bali. The customer service and credit shell application process for Air Asia is terrible. I had to transfer two other airline bookings into a credit shell due to the CV19 situation and both took under two minutes to complete with confirmation coming a few days later. I have tried countless times to contact AirAsia and with no success. Even the telephone line to India is an automated response and redirects you back to their AVA bot chat which is beyond useless. The credit shell process is both difficult and unclear. Extremely disappointing.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Penang to Bali via Kuala Lumpur,July 2019,,,,,,,1,no,3,"  Worst customer service and Chat Bot.  I'm talking about AVA. first of all, AVA gives a set of topics to choose from i.e CoVid 19 Flight Changes, booking changes, etc. If you follow everything right, hypothetically you could reach their actual customer support which I could never reach even after waiting sometimes for 2 hours online. I've been doing this for the past week. Looks like there are many in the same boat here. My only concern is if i cant get my refund processed before my flight date which is on the 23rd April. What happens if I can't reach them?  Wouldn't it be better if we could reach them at a call center instead of chatting with AVA? This is very frustrating!"
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur,February 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Flight was cancelled a week before the departure, due to Covid19 travel ban. Refund was not generated automatically but I have to submit “manually” but unable to due to their system error. Keep appearing as “cancelled”.

They cancelled my flight and I've spent days trying to get a refund or credit. They do anything not to talk to you and put you through hoops of never getting in contact with them. Only way is to drive out to the airport 3 times and still they just send an email shutting the case with no explanation. They cancelled the flight to keep tourists trapped in Bali during Covid and still won't give a refund. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Tokyo Narita to Bangkok,March 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,  Tokyo Narita to Bangkok booked for 6th March.

I went in circles with the Ava online chat to attempt refunds for 4 flights I had booked over March/ April. My flight was cancelled the day before but luckily I had already decided to change the flight. I had an option for a full refund for this flights and after attempting several times through Ava, I was finally able to make a case. I made 5 cases before I received a notification that it's in progress. My other flights cancelled by Air Asia in April however, do not have a refund option. Only credit or moving the date which I do not want. If the flight has been cancelled, I expect a full refund. At this time, I can't even use Ava as the wait time is over 1 hr to be transferred to an agent. The website, Ava and phone numbers that lead nowhere have taken me in circles for weeks and I'm furious that there is no accountability to customers. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Jakarta to Krabi via Kuala Lumpur,May 2019,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1," Jakarta to Krabi via Kuala Lumpur. AirAsia informed suspension of most of their flight operations on 26 March 2020 due to COVID19 situation. Since then I am trying to contact them via their AVA online chat but never can get through to an agent to actually file for refund as per their system. Also tried to call several ticket offices in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand and never got through. The flight status is also unavailable even bookings are still confirmed. I do understand that the customer service is overwhelmed, but for such a company it should not be an issue to establish an efficient request process system. I really tried everything to contact them and I have to assume that this company is staling on requests in order to avoid the many refund requests. I am highly disappointed by what was once the best low-cost airline in Asia and will never consider them anymore in the future."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Bandar Seri Begawan,December 2019,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I was not emailed or contacted regarding the cancellation of the flight. This outbreak has made many travel restrictions and bans to which I was not aware of. I had a feeling my flight was going to be cancelled long ago but it is difficult to contact AirAsia, they have a bot called 'AVA' which isn't a real person who would understand complex questions.  And if you think you can refund the amount you paid for a flight, you won't be pleased when you u read this.  They have refund in the form of ""points"" and ""membership"" benefits. I complained that I was not notified and said ""but you should already"". "

Booked a flight for my girlfriend to meet me in Bangkok, my flight was cancelled so I’ve asked Air Asia to credit my BIG Member account I received a case No, I’ve been non stop on there chat system which is a waste of time, telephone No’s do not connect. The airline customer support is a total disgrace considering the coronavirus situation, they take your money for your ticket but you try and contact them is a disaster, they give no thought for anyone. I have used them before many times, but now see how they treat customers, no chance of getting credit back, very sad company."

I purchased 2 tickets with Airasia, during December to use during the month of March. Of course, during this outbreak, the flights have been cancelled. I have tried to understand that Airasia must have busy times, that everything is chaos. Said all that, its embarrassing how customer support and the answers you receive from the airline. Not Malaysia Airlines, not Jetstar, none of the competitors of AirAsia, have just played dumb and get away with the cancellation. Malaysia Airlines in 5 minutes just changed the dates of my flights, the same with the other airlines. Under the same circumstances, AirAsia has just closed my claims (they recommend to just move flight or ask for credit). All my requests have been closed and told that ""I am not eligible for the credit). Tried Ava: yep. Terrible. System thors constant errors. Where you able finally to lodge a case? Yep. Suddenly all cases closed. Tried calling the call center: Yep. 1 hour on the phone to India. And they only discuss local flights. Still waiting for an answer. Worst customer service And from my side, never again!"

I have spent hours on this only to discover I am charged the full amount. I was promised by email not to be charged any more as I purchased the ticket Jan 2020. It is completely opposite to what the email says.
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Penang to Singapore,March 2020,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,10," Penang to Singapore. Very impressed with Air Asia staff. Due to the Covid19 our 13-year-old son had to fly alone on an emergency flight as his boarding school was being closed with no notice. The staff helped him check-in, put him in 1C (yes, I'm jealous) and escorted him through arrivals and immigration where he had to undergo a medical check and be issued with a stay at home notice. I am so thankful that AirAsia staff looked after him. Well done!"
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chiang Mai to Phuket,March 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Chiang Mai to Phuket. We scheduled flights well before the coronavirus pandemic. When trying to move flights to a different time due to international travel advisories, restrictions, and fear for our health, AirAsia was impossible to get hold of. When we did finally get through via multiple complaints filed, they said we'd still have to pay the change fee or not get refunded. After attempting to contact them numerous other times via every channel possible (AVA, complaints, response to email, attempted to find a phone number with no luck) before our flight was scheduled to depart and we simply never heard back from them. I decided to try them based on price, but it's certainly not worth the lower price."

I was told my bag was slightly too heavy to carry on so I had to repack it twice, and after some miscommunication paid 800.000 VND to check it (was told I could pay cash&card but I couldn’t). The airplane had the tightest seats I have seen. There was no free water served, but they offered goods for purchase. The flight wasn’t full and so I moved up a few rows but was told I couldn’t sit there. It was a different class, but the seats were the same. "

AirAsia should do more for those who are afraid to fly during the COVID-19 period even if the said country is not under 'high alert' (for example Indonesia, which is greatly underestimated due to a lack of monitoring system in place). At least issue some sort of voucher for future use. I will not fly with AirAsia anymore. There is no way to talk or contact a physical live person."

The airline rescheduled our ticket and sent an email with the new itinerary. Upon trying to speak to a customer representative we get this virtual assistant to chat with which keeps on sending automated response based on what we were typing. Then we are send on another page but the page keeps on loading. The airline cancelled our original flight and gave us a transit of 20 hours from KL to Perth. we asked to be given a hotel to freshen us up but they kept on sending us from here to there without any concrete actual help.

In spite of explaining our intent, we were sent by AirAsia staff in Phuket to immigration for exit, which ended up with us reaching Bangkok and being told to stay in the airport for 11 hours! A big shout out to the AirAsia staff in Bangkok who understood what happened and she made us meet the immigration staff in Bangkok, got the exit stamp on our passports reversed and resulted in letting us experience Wat Pho! We had to go through the immigration exit process again which was as per the immigration rules."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Cebu,February 2020,2.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,2,  Kuala Lumpur to Cebu. You need to go to the airport 3 hours before because the check-in staff were slower than usual. They didn't hold to boarding and flight time even while on time. The planes are quite uncomfortable but I don't mind that. The airline has no online customer service other than their AVA chat program. They have nothing to answer even just simple general questions.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuching to Kuala Lumpur,September 2019,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,yes,1,"  Kuching to Kuala Lumpur. I love the flights themselves. Very well priced, punctual and the in flight crew are great. I have given a 1/10 rating for AirAsia's lines of communication pre and post-flight. Facebook and twitter are ghost towns. There is no longer anyone you can get on the phone. You can't find links to make email enquiries. Their virtual assistant AVA isn't much smarter than a house brick. If AVA can't help you she directs you to the 'ghost towns'. If nothing goes wrong you will experience a well priced, punctual and reasonably comfortable flight but if you need to contact anyone to sort out any kind of problem then just forget it."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Gold Coast to Phuket via Kuala Lumpur,January 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I was due to fly Gold Coast to Phuket via Kuala Lumpur on 12th March but received an SMS and email stating the flight had been cancelled. To get through to a human is a long drawn out affair repeating the same question to a  robot and then the same again when the before they connect you to the live chat and then again once they actually come on line after 45 mins or so.. They cancelled the second leg to Phuket and there are now no longer same day connections and you have a 16 hour stopover in KL instead. I booked the flight 6 months ago for a great price, now 3 weeks out they cancel without the decency to offer to put you up in a hotel in KL.  The only offer I get is of a refund or credit and I now have no alternative than to fly from the Gold coast to Sydney and then book a new flight at a total cost of $800 due to the departure date being so near. I have been cut off from the live chat 3 times and the managers are just rude. I an airline mess up they should be held accountable and offer some sort of compensation. "

The original flight I booked was changed, and the new flight allocated to me was no good because I would have missed my international flight. So I contacted AirAsia via the online chat option, and my flight was changed to my preference easily and quickly. Try doing that with Qantas. Many hours later! I arrived for my flight, it was on time, and comfortable. First time I've flown AirAsia, I've heard that they don't have the best name, but I couldn't fault them. From all the staff I met, to the online chat, to the flight, and arriving on time. Thank you AirAsia."

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Krabi to Singapore,February 2020,3.0,3.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,9,"  I sympathize with anyone who has negative experiences with airlines, and cannot speak for other flights, but we had a very positive experience with our AirAsia flight from Krabi to Singapore on February 2. Very smooth check-in, no problems with baggage, super clear announcements. Yes this is a budget airlines, so one should not expect, nor will they get, fancy (or any) food, or spacious seats. But AirAsia got us to our location safe and sound, and what's more on time, and that is all that matters to me."

There was no live customer service at all I could speak to and to investigate this charge and or provide me an invoice. India customer service refused to assist me. Had to dispute the charge with the credit card company since I do not have any details or invoice for these charges.

Through immigration and security also went fast, we talk about less than 5 minutes, very good ! Suvarnabhumi airport should go here and learn. They started boarding 30 minutes before schedule. We had bus out to the gate, and 10 minutes before schedule, we arrived at the plane. The plane was not full this evening, so it started to move, only 3 minutes late. Its pretty narrow onboard, but I did not have my knees crushed in the seat in front of me. We landed ahead of schedule. We are satisfied with Air Asia, everything went smoothly."

Yes, they are low cost but they don’t care about the people that book their flights. They don’t provide any support if you need to modify your flights and only give AVA as a form of “support.” She’s a bot and when she can’t help, she doesn’t provide any helpful contact information to get a hold of someone who can help. Please boycott this airline. They don’t care about anything but the money."

Something very unusual happened, I was given a red seat for free. Probably the plane was full and there were no normal seats available.

Although flights are well managed when on the plane, the check in process is the worst of any airlines I've ever seen. Wait 1 hour to move a few meters, and eventually 30 minutes before each flight they fast forward people through check in since many people are late. Literally they checked in 20 people in 45 minutes, about 10 minutes for each group and I feel this is generous, this makes no sense at all. Also, check in machines were pretty useless since everyone had to check in anyway, which is weird. Perhaps it's the AirAsia Chiang Mai that's so slow .. they need to get their stuff together, horrible experience."

Flight was late but had plenty of time for transfer counter to print said booking closed 5mins ago. Won't do anything. Had to buy another ticket. It took about 7 mins to get to gate from transfer I had 50 minutes. All could have been avoided if they had printed ticket.

We paid over $100 to add our luggage to the plane, and when we landed, we realised they had not loaded 90% of the passengers luggage on the plane. I had many items in my luggage that I require for work, and now I have to wait and hope it arrives. I was not assigned in the seating I had chosen. I  chose an isle seat as I’m a nervous flyer and they put me, in between 2 other passengers. They don’t take card on the plane? So if you want a meal or a drink and don’t have any cash, too bad. "

The staff took my main baggage and sent it to the plane, but there was a problem with my hand luggage and they asked me to pay 50 dollars for 3 kg. Immediately after paying the extra $ 50, the doors were closed and they said they couldn't take me to the plane, and they didn't pay my $50 behind by 5 minutes. We also heard a lot of scolding. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Osaka to Honolulu,January 2020,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Osaka to Honolulu. Shameless price gouging with combined 7kg limit for 2 pieces of carry-on. Flaky website so that you can't pay for checked-in luggage online and forced to pay double the price at the airport. Terrible customer service: staff openly mocking you suggesting to put on all the clothes from your luggage to make 7kg limit. No empathy, no compromises, no apologies, instead rude, dismissive attitude. Staff members covering their ID tags and refusing to call their names so I could file a complaint to upper management. Just out of spite check-in counter staff put me on SSS (selective security screening). The last manager I spoke to had a strategy of listening to my complaints with a poker face, not responding until the gate is about to close, and I am forced to shut up and board."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala lumpur to Bali,January 2020,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Kuala Lumpur to Bali. Our 1030 departure had a 7h delay. It took over an hour for staff to come to the gate to explain that the flight was delayed and to deal with customers. There were 3 of us that wanted to remove our baggage, be refunded and hop over to the other terminal to take a 1230 MAS flight to Bali instead but AirAsia took so long to get staff we realised we would never make it. Staff agreed to move us to a 1615 Air Asia flight to Bali however we had to go back outside to the chaos of baggage drop and immigration. After standing fighting for another hour, they eventually agreed to move our luggage over to the new flight without us having to do it all ourselves. They refused us access to the pod hotel in the departure lounge or their Lounge. They provided one bottle of water for 7h and offered a KFC in that time. Staff pushed us around the houses to talk to operations managers to try and obtain lounge access to relax. "

Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur. We had 4 flights booked and paid together but could not sit together unless we paid additional fees at check in to get seats changed. This is a revenue raising exercise. In addition to that the staff were very rude to me and appear to go out of their way to be unhelpful. In flight service is not existent, flights with not even a free drink without incurring additional costs. Aircraft very cramped spaces, not comfortable. "

My booking was confirmed directly by the service agent of AirAsia. When I reached to counter I was told that the flight was overbooked. I then had to keep on begging the lady at the counter for an hour to let me fly. When I asked the executive at the counter to call the manager, she said now you can travel and I could fly, I just had to simply waste my 1 hour time at the counter with no reason. "

They charged my family of Four 5,000 bht ($227 CAD = $56 CAD/person) upon arrival to check our bags. They go by weight. Apparently you can pay the fee online which is 400 bht but they don’t advertise it much. They also offer the lower price if you’re 4 hours early (who would come that early). When we complained they said that’s how it is and weren’t accommodating. Also no flight entertainment or food service on our flight. Would highly recommend a different airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Shenzhen,December 2019,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Kuala Lumpur to Shenzhen. I came for an early flight to China at 610am, made sure there won't be any screw ups. Boarding gate was P1 on the boarding pass, and I waited for over an hour, and I realized things wasn't right when I do not see any crowd at the gate. Went to check on the screen and it shows the boarding gate is Q7, and it has closed.  Explained my situation to the staff, looked at me and said there's 3 other passengers with the same situation but they all boarded the flight. Other staff told me to work things out at the service counter. Went to the service centre and things went back and forth where it felt like they are trying to look for any fault in the customer. They gave me a replacement flight, which is at 420pm, and two RM20 meal voucher. The summary is that the replacement tickets are a courtesy/favour and I should appreciate it. "

The departure / arrival was on time and the aircraft made an average maintained impression. The seat spacing was felt a bit lower than other airlines. Food and drinks were, for a low-cost airline, only for a fee. Overall, a good but not special experience."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Medan,December 2019,3.0,2.0,,,,1.0,4,yes,3," Bangkok to Medan. Significant delay and no real apology. Flew QZ155. It only started to board at the time it should have been leaving, with no obvious reason (eg the incoming aircraft had been on time). Then crew running around and finding a passenger was missing. But then it took a further 30 minutes to find and offload the luggage from that passenger. So finally a delay of almost an hour. Not really acceptable on a 2-hour flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Kuala Lumpur,November 2019,4.0,5.0,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5,yes,8,"  Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Even after adding in seat selection and 20kg of baggage, the price was still affordable and cheap considering that I only booked a month before the flight. There were problems with the self check-in as I had checked in online with AirAsia, luckily this was sorted out very quickly. Immigration at Changi Airport was very fast. The plane left on the dot at 7:35am and the gate my plane was at was the closest to the runway, so we were in the air very quickly. The seat pitch was just about okay for my height, and it was comfortable for a short flight. The plane was one of the older ones in AirAsia's fleet, not fitted with the sharklets seen on the newer A320s, and the cabin did show signs of ageingty. As it was a 40min flight and a budget airline, there was not much the cabin crew had to do but they were warm and friendly. One interesting perk about this flight was the ability to stream the inflight entertainment into my own device without needing to download a seperate app; all I had to do was to connect to the inflight WiFi which was enabled even on this short hop and I found it very unique, setting aside AirAsia from other budget carriers, and the selection was quite generous too, with some movies, documentaries and even games. The flight landed in Kuala Lumpur early and we had a short taxi into KLIA2, very quickly we were disembarking. Overall, given AirAsia's punctuality and cost, I would definitely pick AirAsia again if I'm travelling to Malaysia or want to travel on a budget."

A  rude customer service employee at  Kuala Lumpur airport told us it was our fault since if they had told us we did not have enough time then we would have done it anyway. 
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hyderabad to Mumbai,October 2019,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4,yes,9,"  AirAsia have provided an excellent customer experience throughout our journey. The cabin crew were very polite and helpful. I have found that most of the passengers traveling from Hyderabad to Mumbai are local travelers with ""Telugu"" as the native language. The announcements made in flight are in ""English"" and ""Hindi"" languages. It would be very helpful for the passengers if the announcements in flight are made in the native language for the domestic flights. All the elderly passengers would be comfortable with this change. Hope to see this change from my next flight with you! "

First of all they force people to use PSA which sells expensive tickets by making a bank error on online service if using cards from Maldives. They lost my luggage cover, which was never found after struggles.  On my second sector to Kota Bharu- the que was long and when I reached to drop off the baggage (like a minute) they said I was too late and send me from one counter to another and made me wait and said I can board the plane without the luggage (while travelling with a 2 year old). No other options. Had to buy buy 2 extra tickets for me and the child. 3. When I left the trolley at a side, Air Asia staff told me to take it to the another location, I said I cannot leave my baby behind to put the trolley back, he mumbled rudely. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Bali,November 2019,3.0,3.0,,,,3.0,2,no,3,  Singapore to Bali. What a disappointing experience. We went to automatic check in. That machine worked for only one of us. The other one had to go to the counter to check in. Later once we already passed the customs we found out about not sitting next to each other and asked for a correction. This could only be changed if we were willing to pay extra. I asked if they could put us on an earlier flight so that I would be home sooner. This was possible but we had to buy new tickets!
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Lombok to Denpasar,November 2019,3.0,5.0,1.0,,,4.0,4,yes,7,  Our flight on November 2 from Lombok to Denpasar became memorable only because of the inflight service.

If you have connecting flight this airline will get you in trouble. This airline seems to attract people attracted to low price and fly point to point only, where long wait in the terminal and extensive delays does not matter. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tagbilaran to Manila,October 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Tagbilaran to Manila. AirAsia is extremely gimmicky and unprofessional! I've flown with very many different airlines for almost 40 years now and I've never ever experienced such unprofessional treatment. They are the only airline that counts your personal/cosmetic bag as part of carry-on baggage weight. However, they only selectively enforce this policy so that makes them utterly unprofessional. I chose to fly with AirAsia for the first time because they had the cheapest cost for my round trip from Manila to Tagbilaran/Panglao, Bohol in the Philippines. On the Manila, to Tagbilaran flight, my carry-on baggage and personal/cosmetic bag were not even checked or weighed at all, but on my flight back the customer service agent chose to enforce their stupid policy and made me pay an extra baggage fee. The worst part about this experience was that I was made to open and repackage my personal/cosmetic bag, carry-on bag, and checked baggage while I was at the check in counter. I was struggling to get the weight just right for them and a security guard noticed me struggling and whispered to me to just take out my laptop from my carry-on baggage because then AirAsia won't count it as carry-on weight if I only take out my laptop and carry it by hand. It's so damn ridiculous! Why didn't the customer service agent just tell me this and save me money, time, embarrassment, and frustration in the first place? Why did she make me go through all that trouble and money and time wasted? I also asked this customer service agent to let me speak with the manager and she just kept telling me ""ok"" or ""they're busy right now."" I also noticed that very few other passengers were made to weigh both their carry-on and personal/cosmetic bags as I were. This horrible airline is the worst airline I've ever flown on in my almost 40 years of flying all over the world on so many other different airlines and I will never ever fly with this joke of an ""airline"" ever again. If you want professional and fair service do not ever fly with Air Asia! They're just a gimmick and a huge joke!"

Be sure to choose a seat that's possible to recline. The distance between the seats are tiny. Me and my girlfriend got seats as far away from each other as possible. Asked if it was possible to get a seat next to each other but no. Even I saw later that there were two seats next to each other.  The Airasia part in KLIA is also bad, really crowded and not many places to eat/shop."

Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Jakarta to Singapore,August 2019,3.0,1.0,,,,1.0,2,no,3,"  
I flew from Cengkareng Airport in Jakarta to Changi in Singapore. There are too many bad things flying with this airline. I paid about $250 for a two-way ticket Jakarta to Singapore. At the website, I had to pay an additional $30 for check-in baggage. When I checked-in, the female staff were rude. No greetings and pretending to be busy like I was invisible. And them the flight was late. Scheduled to depart at 11.20 am. At 12.30 pm the plane was still on the runway waiting for take off. As a result, the flight was late about an hour arriving in Singapore. I had a meeting at 4 pm on the same day and I was late and it was embarrassing because they thought I was not punctual. When in fact, it was caused by Air Asia. And then, when returning home, the staff in Singapore were rather mute. They just saw us, say nothing and kept working. Hello? Are you human or robot? Can you talk? Wow? They call Air Asia a company? Even a 1 star hotel in Singapore does a better service. I would say improve the service or good luck in the future."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Hyderabad to Mumbai,October 2019,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,3,no,1," Hyderabad to Mumbai with AirAsia.

The check-in was not really fast even though it's self-service and there are many security checks. The boarding time was delayed for roughly 20 minutes. The food I had on the flight (teriyaki chicken rice and curry puff) was just average. The crew is quite young, they did okay service. Seats can recline,  Legroom is terrible. The best thing you can do on this one is having a sleep. Don't choose this airline if you can afford any other options."

Poor airline with excessive seat rows and extremely tiny seats. Flights were delayed on both ways with no compensation. Delays were an hour and felt like the delays were somewhat on purpose for the airline to save money. When boarding gates, no personnel came to check details and everyone just stormed into the gate. This is by far the worst experience I ever had on an airline. Only travel on this airline if you like to arrive late to your destination."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bali to Bangkok,August 2019,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,2,no,1,"  Bali to Bangkok. Chaos at check in counter in Bali! The counter opened late and passengers were nervous. There were many flights leaving around the same time, passengers from earlier flights tried to skip the queue and go first making other passengers furious. There were no sign indicating which flight should check in first and which flight later, so passengers clustered everywhere in front of check in counters. Very unpleasant experience."

I pre-purchased 20kg of sport equipment baggage aiming to cover 2 bags of mine. (The combined weight of my 2 bags was 18kg.) A ground staff told me that I could only check in one bag and had to hand carry my other bag. Her reason was that the other bag could not be sport equipment! I've traveled with sport equipment several times with AirAsia, but this was the first time a ground staff refused to check in both bags because such staff believed that my other bag could not be sport equipment! I wonder why other ground staff from my previous flights never had a problem with me.."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bali to Seoul via Kuala Lumpur,September 2019,3.0,4.0,,,,4.0,2,no,3," Bali to Seoul via Kuala Lumpur. AirAsia sent us an email the morning of our flight stating that they pushed back our departure. We contacted the customer service chat and tried to resolve the issue. The initial agent said that they would put us on an earlier flight out of our current location, however, they failed to provide us a case number. Additionally, they stated that the flight change would be processed in 2 to 3 hours, which is ridiculous. We had to contact a second customer service agent through their chat service. They then provided us with our case number but reiterated that they could not expedite our flight change any faster than the 2 to 3 hours quoted by the initial agent. When we asked if there was a number we could call the agent stated that they are in the process of closing all of their call centers. They did nothing to ease the stress of having a last-minute flight change that would make us miss a day of work. This was unhelpful and led to the last few hours of our vacation being stressful and having to re-arrange multiple plans. Definitely not good customer service."

I arrived at the Gate 4 at the Kuching International Airport at 9.20 this morning (12 Sept 2019) for the 9.30  Kuching-KL flight, but the push-back for the plane had already taken place. The ground crew gave me an excuse as to why the plane departed 10 minutes earlier than scheduled. Consequently, I had to purchase a later flight (10.50 Kuching-KL flight) at a cost of RM349. If the plane in actuality departs 10 minutes earlier, then the Airline should state inform passengers that the flight was scheduled at 9.20, not 9.30 am."

Customer service could not have been more unhelpful. We had credits towards a flight that “due to a bug in their system” they weren’t able to apply to our flight. Which is questionable - why should we pay for their error and incompetence? Every time we tried to rectify the issue we were issued a new agent and new complaint number and had to start from scratch every time. In the end, they said they were working to applying it towards our flight but it could also be used to pay for baggage. Of course the problem was never resolved, so we assumed we could at least check our baggage using our credits. Wrong. Apparently there is no systemic connection between the people at the air Asia counter and the customer service people online. The people at the counter were unhelpful at best. Ultimately, the customer service online system and the physical counter at airasia are somehow not linked. Very advanced system! We were told we had to request online 4 hours in advanced of the flight to use the credits towards our baggage. Of course this was not mentioned by customer service online. The people behind the counter were very rude and condescending and made no attempt to resolve the problem other than to tell us to contact online customer service - the same folks who had not responded to any of our recent inquiries/ noted we could just apply the credits to our baggage for our next flight. I have had the shit beaten out of me by a bunch of meth heads, and I preferred that to dealing with air Asia’s customer service. "

Flight was delayed by 6 hours and AirAsia could not accommodate me getting on to another flight. I was travelling for a specific event which I could not miss, so I had to purchase another ticket on another airline at KL airport. AirAsia could not be more unhelpful and told me to go through their AVA chat line to request a refund for my missed flight. I did - only to find out that my case was never recorded. Just tried to process the refund again and ran into technical issues. The ordeal was extremely stressful and expensive, and their customer service is a joke. "

Simply the worst airline in the world, many years running. I’ve been unfortunate enough to have to rely on this sorry excuse for an airline for years and not once, not once, have I ever had a good experience. Not a single flight that went smoothly, with no delay or some other nonsense. Awful service, always late, anything to take your money and always unpleasant. The only thing they haven’t charged us for yet is oxygen on board, which at some point it will probably be charged also, 10 cents per breath. If only there were other options for certain destinations. Today’s misfortune: retiming of flight the day before, only to come to airport, go to gate as indicated and find out there (i.e. at the gate) that there would be another delay on top of a change in gates.

I’ve been unfortunate enough to have to rely on this sorry excuse for an airline for years and not once, not once, have I ever had a good experience. Not a single flight that went smoothly, with no delay or some other nonsense. Awful service, always late, anything to take your money and always unpleasant. The only thing they haven’t charged us for yet is oxygen on board, which at some point it will probably be charged also, 10cents per breath. If only there were other options for certain destinations. Today’s misfortune: retiming of flight the day before, only to come to the airport, go to the gate as indicated and find out there (i.e. at the gate) that there would be another delay on top of a change in gates. Still waiting to board, holiday ruined. Avoid this airline if you can. Pay more, get better service somewhere else."

With my camera and commuter stuff that's already nearly 7kg. It doesn't make sense that I can't take more. What's worse is that the company makes airport staff charge people fees to check in bag. I had a total of 14kg with two small bags. The staff made me check in my bag and charged me nearly 90USD ""for 0-15kg overweight"".  To top it all off, the staff lost my bags' special cover during transit and took no responsibility for it. They said ""that's not covered by us"" I will not fly AirAsia for these reasons. "

Ground service is normal, quick check-in and baggage drop although when entering boarding gate (is it normal at CGK, one boarding gate could serve 2 different flights) did not put clear signs indicating which queue lines were for which flight, some passenger queued in the wrong line. Delayed take-off due to runaway congestion and bad visibility (maybe) but we still landed ahead of schedule. Food, I ordered Chicken Kungpao with rice and it was just bad. The rice and chicken were super dry, sauce too watery and taste like soy sauce. Not what you expect of kungpao chicken."

After an hour of phoning 24 hour hire car companies I gave up, which meant the Hotel that was booked and paid for in JB was not used and unable to be refunded and the trip planned to Legoland with my 5, 7 and 10 year old sons was now canceled.

I'm 6'4"" tall and literally could not sit in my seat without physically bruising my knees as the legroom is that short. I stood for entire flight apart from when seatbelt signs were on and came away with bad bruising to both my knees. Despite there being 11 extra legroom seats available the cabin crew would not let me sit there (even for extra payment that I offered) but instead just smiled at me as I stood. I showed then the damage the seat had done to my knees after take off and they just did not care. I watched them throw a lady out of the extra legroom seat who was trying to breastfeed a baby, this is how uncaring they are. On making a subsequent complaint I received a totally inadequate reply from them. If you are over 5'8"" do not use. I am now looking at taking legal action for my injuries and suffering as only way I can see these airlines learning."

I have tried during different bookings to apply the credit I had with AirAsia but neither the Big Points or the Credit Account ever worked, I applied them but they magically disappeared whenever I click the magic button ""pay"" and the full amount has always been charged to my bank account. I have complained a couple of times but the only answer those ""customer service representative"" give is some template answer saying that they are sorry bla bla bla and my points are still there to redeem.

I guess they don't want to pay for direct access to their aircraft? Of course the bus does not stop at the edge of the platform, you'll have to get down a high step and then get on the bus, one more step. Then get off the bus, one more step and a nice stair is waiting for you and your disability! In fact, Air Asia has changed its slogan: ""Now the disabled can walk"" And Don Mueang airport is changing its name, it is now the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes Airport! The place where miracles happen, in this case, it's a paid miracle, a miracle that will never happen."

Knowing that my bags were overweight, I made sure to send a courier back home before flying back. Turns out I was 3 kgs overweight which even an airline like Air India was willing to let go of (yes, I had a connecting flight prior to my Air Asia reservation). When I checked-in I was told that my bags were overweight and that I needed to pay 1200 rupees. Had a bag less than 2kgs for cabin luggage which should have been taken into consideration but wasn’t. Never mind the 1200 bucks. No big deal. What really angered me was learning that AirAsia charged a single mother travelling with her 9 year old son 300 rupees to get seats next to each other. I mean, I’ve seen inhuman and now I’ve seen AirAsia! What level of exploitation does an airline company need to adhere to make money? I mean, how do people who make money through these days extremely cheap and disgusting ways sleep at night? It’s a 9 year old child. Knowing that parents will do anything to have a sense of security over their children, AirAsia has done the unthinkable! I urge everyone to share this experience and ensure this airline sees the fate it deserves. Absolutely disgusted beyond words!"

Nothing like the ""bus station"" nightmare I had in my head for so many years. Nice terminal, no bussing around, elegant leather seats, attractive but well-trained crew, decent Asian meals and overall a youthful and energetic vibe. Well done!

I just found out that I will need to fly straight to Melbourne from Bali for work reasons and won't have time to fly home to Perth. However, Air Asia does not allow for a change of flight destination, meaning I have to book an entirely new flight. I would understand the expectation to pay some kind of a fee for updating the flight destination, but the fact that they don't even offer it as an option is an extreme inconvenience.  Air Asia prevents you from changing flights is to force you into paying for an entirely new flight. I will be doing this as I have no other option, but I will certainly not be flying with Air Asia again."

Aside from the friendly staff member who was helping with self service bag drops, staff we encountered did not greet us and did not say ‘how can I help you’. My wife and I did not pay additional to get side by side seats for an 8 hour flight. We were told to check with the KL counterparts but we knew that was just an excuse since we won’t have time to speak to anybody after the SIN-KUL leg. We did try but the KL staff told us we could not, without checking the flight status nor touching her keyboard. Cabin crew told us to power down our phone. How do our phones still affect planes in 2019? I was told off by a flight attendant for not powering down as a first warning. Don’t I deserve some slack as a customer? "

CGK-KUL flight was delayed by 45 min due to some runway repairs that we could see from the window. Flight arrived only slightly late. KUL-MAA flight landed 20 min ahead of time. Although I was flying on cheap tickets I could buy exit row aisle seats for both flights. The middle seat remained vacant in both flights probably because no one wants to pay for the pleasure of sitting in the middle seat! In both flights the meal that I had preordered turned out to be pretty tasty. This is what I like about this airline - at the time of booking you can buy the degree of comfort that you want, verify it and then pay for it. Many other airlines would not allow cheap ticket holders to select premium seats. After flying full service airlines on business for decades I have recently switched to AirAsia in part due to the simplicity of the whole process - booking, seat and meal selection, checkin and boarding. The entire meal service is over quickly and they leave you in peace for the rest of the flight. If you need any snack or drink you could walk to the galley and buy it. Also for destinations in the South, SE Asia region they seem to offer the fastest connections."

I had already checked in online but had to check in my pre-paid for luggage. I was there approx 3.5 hours prior to boarding time yet the line up took over 1.5 hours. It was  chaos and only 2 employees checking everyone in. Standing for 1.5 hours is outrageous. Then we boarded the plane 40+ mins late. Once we got on the plane we didn’t leave the tarmac for another 70 minutes. I was unable to make my connecting flight to Chiang Mai. The next flight out was over 7 hours later and air Asia did nothing about it. No hotel, no vouchers, no compensatio.. I had to sleep in the airport, miss a half day of my vacation in Chiang Mai and forfeit my hotel I had pre purchased for in Chiang Mai for the night. Talked to several different air Asia employees in Bangkok airport, none of which were even the least bit helpful or simpathetic. Won’t  fly airasia again.

The airline generally offers a great price for my distance I have to travel. However, the cabin crew doesn't really greet us while we board the aircraft which makes us feel a little bit unwelcome. The legroom is also below average but fortunately it is just a very short flight."

Perth to Bali. Absolutely shocking customer service. An error occurred when booking my flight, AirAsia was impossible to deal with and refused to change my return date unless I paid $150. I escalated the issue to management and after weeks of following up I have just received a response 2.5 months after first lodged declining to refund. Do not fly with this Airline."

This is the fifth time that I flew with Air Asia. I've used a few other budget airlines and the services, seats, etc. are standard for any budget airlines - so no complaints. However, I made a purchase for food/drinks on Air Asia, the cabin crew would say that they did not have a small change & promised to give me the change later. On my recent trip from Colombo to Kuala Lumpur, they owed me RM4 and didn't give me the change (I forgot to ask them before I left)."

As much as such a flight can be comfortable. It helps when a flight is half full as ours was. Professional crew and as expected they will do anything to promote what ever they sell. If crew on regular airline would make water runs half as often as i have had the drinks sales trolley pass on airasia flight this would make flying more comfortable. On the flight to Denpasar we had what seems to be a new A320 from AirAsia indonesia , return flight on a very tired A320 from AirAsia Thailand. Enjoyed my flights, will surely use them again."

However we reached Singapore airport to find our baggage missing! Still following up with authorities for tracking my missing baggage. Never have had such bad service.

Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Singapore,March 2018,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,2,no,1," Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. AirAsia is known with low-cost fare, but does it mean Low cost = no service? Other than Low-cost fare, Air Asia well known with flight delay, flight rescheduled, poor customer service. It happens regularly that the flight rescheduled on every single flight. Other than the Air Asia low price on promotion is attractive, you'll not surprise if you heard any bad feedback comment about how AA disappointing customer. I'm not the first one and I believe will not be the last one. How AA Customers support system fooling customer around? It must be a platform to train your patience. AA customer support system has 4 ways to contact Air Asia which are Live chat (24/7), call centre, Twitter(24/7) and e-form. I have tried 4 of them: Live chat (24/7): it has been removed - 26 Dec 2018 URL No Longer Exists You have to wait for average 1 hour on live chat queue to say hi to a live chat staff. If you miss the screen when the conversation started, you will kick out from the chatroom by livechat staff, when you check back the screen, it showed ""thank you for contacted live chat"". You have to wait for another one hour. Live chat staff could simply end your conversation without your notice, so even your question not yet finish,you will be kicked out by the staff again. Call centre: I have called to call centre from Malaysia at RM2 per minute! I wanted to buy/add-on/upgrade my baggage to 25kg (3 days before my flight), but it is no longer available on ""modify"" at the airasia homepage. The only way is you have to call them (yes waste time + money), otherwise it would me RM45/kg (not sure they increase the price or not) at the check-in counter. waiting time: generally 10 minutes. Twitter (24/7) the so-called ""24/7"" Twitter service is totally a lie. You can tweet them 24/7, but they will only reply to you immediately, most of the time a few hours or few days. (tweet them for 5 months due to my lost bag case). When the staff is free they will tell you Please wait for the investigation or there's not much they can do, please contact live chat/call/e-form. Live chat, twitter and call centre will push all the responsibility to e-form. Ask you to contact e form. E-form has annoyed and wasted my time the most. It took few days/about 1 month to reply to you, they could just reply sorry that they have done their best and simply closed the case straight after. I've created the same case for 3 times because the staff closed my case without solving my problem, but it is written in the email that my case has been solved, or you didn't reply the email within 7 days. Here comes the tactic: at first you can still contact the AA staffs, but after 3-4 emails, suddenly your reply cannot reach to the AA support team and this will end up case closed because the system shows that you didnt reply to the AA email. When you reply, a no reply email message will tell you that your case has closed, if you need any assistant, please send an e form again! I strongly advise you be aware when you book the AA ticket. The price is really attractive, but please make sure you add on all the bag, meal etc. For the locals, I suggest you check also the price from Malaysia Airlines, Fireflyz and Malindo."

KLIA2 was orderly, not too much that mad rush. Experience with the Premium Flex had been most positive, from check in to arrival. Plane slightly delayed by 30 minutes, which was minor. A surprising light load, with many empty seats, I had all 3 hot seats of row 3 to myself! Therefore, service is quicker and crew very courteous. The chicken rice was delicious. Rest of the flight was uneventful and relaxing. Overall, it's worth to pay that little extra on Air Asia."

I was very pleasantly surprised how smooth things were. From check in to boarding, and through to KL. It was a nice touch that premium flex passengers were entitled a 30kg, a free meal, frontal hot seats, exclusive check in counter and priority luggage. I found out sourced ground staffs in HKG courteous, boarding was orderly, where priority for premium flex passengers were strictly observed. Seat pitch of hot seats were quite ok, just like any regular economy class of any airlines. Cabin crew are energetic and do their job well. Pre-ordered meal was actually quite tasty, mine was a kung-pao chicken with a free water. The duty free item I ordered was delivered to me with a smile. Plane took off and landed on time. KLIA2 is a good terminal with many shops and eateries. I am very satisfied with the whole experience."

The FA leaned on the desk without smile at boarding time, after entering the cabin, the FAs didn't assist any woman or elderly person in packing their luggage. They just standing in the aisle. And the FA called me back to my seat, I just want to changed seat with others. I don't think I  can understand the flight attendant instructions in case of an emergency. It was a Red-eye flight, everyone wanted to sleep, but the cabin was always lit. And they spoke so loudly that I could hear laughter with earplugs. I  didn't sleep all night. Although I don't want any service, it's very uncomfortable for me to have a bad rest on a 3 hour flight."

During 4 legs of my journey, 3 are delayed. As we rush in the airport to go to the next leg, there is no notice about our next flight being delayed thus prompting us to rush even though we should not need to rush. During the delay, there is no compensation. The flight attendants is far from friendly. They seem to be more apt at ordering people around. The seating is cramped. They wanted all electronics to be switched off, not just on airplane mode during take off and landing. "

We didnt get our assigned seats as the plane was changed last minute. We were told to sit anywhere until they have everyone seated which meant we had to constantly get up to give up the seats. This was not a good experience. The staff did not apologise. One staff member got very rude to us and shouted at us to be patient. Our flight got delayed by 70 minutes.

First it started with an email that the flight will be delayed due to further servicing then a second email on our way to the airport. However I heard at checked in counter desk a different reason that the assigned aircraft is not available but a new plane will be coming from Manila. And the lady at the counter told me that the plane will be further delayed. Once we passed security, we saw the departure screen was flashing further time of departure. So not sure who to believe anymore but I see lots of lies from AirAsia. This is the second time I actually experience this coming from Cebu so will try other airlines from now on and see who is better at keeping their time and also with communication consistency."

During check-in, baggage check-in was quite fast. In the new airport, it was comfortable and many lanes that open for passengers to check-in.

The cabin crew was nice, ground handling is fast, good online check in platform, good customer service. I got no delay when I go to KL but when i back to Jakarta, I got delay around a hour but its ok. The seat is so so, food was good, no inflight entertainment.

In Vientiane the check-in counter asked for $200 USD for 2 bags. That is airport/airline robbery. They said it was because we had booked a transfer but we booked from Vientiane to Singapore, they had the stopover in Bangkok included in the booking. I have flown hundreds of time on dozens of different airlines and never been charged for a transfer when the booking is with one airline through their website. Also the price is gross and disrespectful to their customers. My partner and I shuffled items around to fit into one checked bag, however, the whole process was horrible, ridiculous, and not customer friendly. I can't believe we had to pay $100 for one bag for one booking. I am very upset and irritated, I will never book with them again."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Bali,August 2018,,,,,,,2,no,2,  Bangkok to Bali. I recently booked a flight with Air Asia through their website. I was very careful to uncheck as many of the automatically checked add-ons during the check-out process. There was one add-on for travel insurance that I missed. I was subsequently charged for travel insurance when it was not something I intended to purchase. I wrote to them requesting a refund that they promptly informed me that it was not possible as I did not untick the box for travel insurance. Why on earth would they require a customer to untick an add-on rather than ask them if they would like an add-on and have them initiate the add-on with a tick? I am truly disappointed that this is how they operate.

Flight was more than 50% empty, so obviously the overall experience was better. Boarding was on time and efficient, and crew were reasonably pleasant. For this short flight, I had paid for the first row of seats, and so legroom was aplenty. The A320 had obviously seen quite a lot of service, seats were clean but felt like the cushions had sagged a little. Halfway through the flight, was impressed that inflight connectivity (rokki) allowed reading of the AirAsia inflight magazine, brief travel guides, news and simple games on iPad, all for free. Impressive for a no-frills airline. Flight landed on time, and disembarkation was fuss free. If seat comfort was a tad better, this would be a 5-star low-cost airline flight."

This is my first time flying with Air Asia. I was apprehensive of the questionable standard since it's a budget airline which gives the bare minimum, but get you from A to B. I took the plunge and tried to return to Hong Kong from Bali with it. It was operated by Thai Air Asia. I booked fly+bag+eat combo, sat on front row seat. Check in at Bali airport was friendly and efficient. I am happy to report that the experience had been very positive. Crew were courteous and smiling. Ordered meals were promptly delivered, and it actually tasted ok. I like the fact that Air Asia makes no qualm about bringing outside food and drink on board for own consumption. Seat was bound in leather, well padded and comfortable for the 4 hour journey. There was a lay over of 2 hours in Bangkok old airport Don Muang, it was welcoming as one could stretch the legs and do some shopping, or eat a good meal before the 2nd leg. The same good standard of service continued for the next flight back home. I was able to check my bags through from bali to Hong Kong. Transit process was very simple and direction crystal clear. Upon arrival, my bags were one of the first to come out. The fly bag eat combo actually do include priority luggage, a really nice touch. I also noticed that the 2 flights left and arrived on time. Based on the good experience, I will not hesitate to fly with them again in future."

Excellent inflight service and entertainment for the guests. Pleasant music played throughout the journey, food was very good plus an hitherto unseen entertainment for guests on flight. The airhostess(two of them) woke us all up by their energetic dance performance. This was followed by a quiz. Correct answers were awarded with AirAsia goodies. Perfect holiday experience. "

An agent caught up with me and explained it would be quicker and easier for him to organise.  He returned after a short period, having had to run from Gate K to Gate J and return with both my boarding pass and luggage ticket. I was so grateful as he had taken the initiative to go far and beyond his duties to fix my problem. This person should be highly recommended for advancement in the company as he put the company first for customer service which was so appreciated."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kunming to Bangkok,July 2018,,,,,,,2,no,1,"  Kunming to Bangkok. I booked my ticket with them well in advance and also pre-purchased baggage as it is cheaper to do so. I realized my ticket would be non-refundable if I had to cancel this flight, but I expected them to grant a credit with the airline for future flights. But they refused to refund any amount, even the baggage fees, and didn't grant any credit for future flights. This level of customer service is appalling. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh City,September 2018,3.0,3.0,,,,3.0,1,no,1, Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh City. What a joke. My friend and I bought ticket together under 1 transaction. Airline let us sit separately when checked in. Reason: all seats are full. We bought ticket 4 months in advance. When they heard that they asked us to request the in-flight attendant. Of couse that didn't work and we ended up sitting separately. Bottom line: don't buy this airline if you travel in group.

My flight scheduled at 11.50 pm and it delayed by 3.5 hours. I have a transit of 2.5hrs in Malaysia and need to catch flight to Melbourne which I can’t catch due to this delay. When I ask the counter person about the connecting flight they said the next connecting flight will be in 2.5 hrs after I landed in Malaysia. But when I went to transfer counter in Malaysia they said the next connecting flight is after 12hrs and gave me couple of meal vouchers. Obviously very poor customer service and most unreliable. Counter people are useless as they don’t have knowledge of the flight schedule. I requested them for  lounge entry which they rejected to give. I have spent $100 to book a room in the airport. Should reach Melbourne 8.00 pm local time and I reached next day morning 8.00 am and took day off from my work.

My round trip flight should have cost me $130. But I ended up spending a total of $270 because they charged me to check my bag twice. They charged me $40 to check my bag from Saigon to Bangkok (a 3 hour layover) and then $57 from Bangkok to Phuket. They said they couldn’t let my bag go all the way to Phuket from Saigon for some odd reason.  Do yourself a favor and avoid.

My last experience with AirAsia was way back in 2012 to Sabah. This time, for a 1 hour flight I could say that I'm quite impressed. Ground service was good, even though I used self check in, staff assisted me in putting on my baggage tag. They redirected me smoothly and was quite helpful when I encountered a problem. This time around, I took this opportunity to survey on ""Allstars"", something which AirAsia is proud about and I wanted to see it for myself. Upon boarding, flight attendant greeted warmly, safety procedures were done (flight attendant did not smile, at least she looks serious), one passenger made a fuss and the stewardess handled it quickly and efficiently. Flight experience was good, take-off was smooth and views were fantastic. Even saw a rainbow for a moment over the clouds! I pre-ordered a meal and when I had some left over, they offered to tapao (take away) for me! Kudos for the Malaysian slang. Had two kids sitting next to me, so I helped them fasten their seatbelts, steward thanked me with a smile(I did not expect that!) Unfortunately, Roki was not working so in flight entertainment is boring. Landing was good, flight on time and had 2 captains for that flight. Overall experience was amazing for an LCC. Highly recommended!"

Of course there are not many amenities or complimentary services but for the price I paid, the only thing which should be improved is the legroom space, this was really narrow, but this was ok for a two hours flight."

As usual, online check-in for Airasia is available, until the last 24 hours before the flight. Departing to the flight is seamless and ground staff were helpful. When the plane leaving the aerobridge, there were some passengers that still stand at aisle and not on their seat, and pretty sure that is dangerous. During the flight, staff were really friendly and helpful. There were some turbulence during the flight, but no big deal. However, pre-booked meal that I had was terrible. Spiral pasta with sausages was plain and sad. Not recommended."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Bali,July 2018,1.0,4.0,1.0,,,3.0,2,no,1,  As a low-cost airline AirAsia has no entertainment and food or drink should be paid on the flight. I found the leg space insufficient for a person who is 5’10” or more. I hope AirAsia provides better services to customers in the near future.

The return to Manila was terrible! I am 6' 2"" and I had no clearance for my knees.  This was not a planned trip. I have been in Philippines for 3 years and had to leave, for a silly rule. and come back again, so it was just a quick trip, away and back. For an international flight the seat configuration was uncalled for. "

Self check-in machines are not available across the airport, but it is only available in the Airasia check-in counter section, which requires a bit of walking. This same goes to the boarding gate which is quite far. I hope Airasia could get a better spot of it."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta,July 2018,3.0,4.0,,,,3.0,3,yes,7,"   Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. Check-in went well, as there are many self check-in machines in the KLIA2 airport. Boarding was relatively on-time and there was no issue. The best part is when landing in Jakarta, since Airasia is now operating in the new airport where they provide better services."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Narita to Phuket via Bangkok,July 2018,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," Very disappointed with Air Asia as a frequent flyer after last experience. Online check-in had errors and glitches which did not allow me to checkin early, charged 40,000 yen at airport. Showed pictures of website glitches and errors, airline does not care or understand. Then I was accidentally tripled charged on my return flight baggage. Had 5 transactions for baggage totaling over $800 USD! My two tickets cost only around $700. Was refunded for some of the excess charges, however such a hassle and online help and calling is very time consuming and stressful and not user friendly. I figured if I provided pictures and explained my problems the airline would understand the online checkin and website had experienced problems and was not working properly. Poor customer service using live chat and submitting cases on issues, just replied back with automated answers. Like talking to a computer. Nobody should have to get charged over $800 USD and worry about 5 charges for 2 small check-in bags, especially unauthorized charges. Very disappointed and will never fly again because of airlines poor recognition of the problem, poor customer service and failure to refund a small cost that should never of happened. Nobody should have to go through that stress while on vacation!"

However, Airasia is now implemented a strict 7kg policy where cabin baggage has to be strictly only up to 7kg, or else it would be charge expensively."

It was a red eye flight and we arrived around 5am in the morning. I had to clear customs although I had a flight on Air Asia in the evening. The time went very quickly so it must have been a good flight. I was able to stretch out and get some rest.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Surabaya to Kuala Lumpur,May 2018,3.0,3.0,,,,4.0,4,yes,7,"  Surabaya to Kuala Lumpur. As what I am expected from AirAsia low-cost airlines, decent service and flight are always present in the whole experience. The time of flight departure is quite accurate. One of the hassle is the flight is getting strict with their 7kg cabin baggage rule. The seat is quite comfy, in comparison with other low-cost airlines. The interior is more vibrant compare to the others. I experienced no turbulence, as what I remember during the flight. Overall, would love to fly with AirAsia again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Phuket,February 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Hong Kong to Phuket. I booked the premium flex ticket to get good leg room. I was advised that this type of ticket allowed me to change my flight date at an extra charge.  I needed to change my flight date more than a month before flight date. I tried for days to access my booking on Airasia homepage and when the page finally allowed me to login (I had correct login credentials, the page just didnt work for days) it said I had no booking. Finally I had to call their customer service to have the flight changed instead. At customer support I explained that I needed to change my flight and was told that I had to sit on a standard seat. I asked if it could be solved. They didnt even try to have it sold but just said no. I end up with normal seat instead. I then asked for a refund since I was no longer getting what I paid for. Instead I was asked to pay 1500HKD extra for the change of the flight. I had known about this rule before, but I still asked for compensation due to not getting what I paid for. Also I later found out that if I had booked a new ticket instead of using my return ticket the cost of the new ticket would have been 1700HKD. That is 200HKD more than the fee I had to pay for changing my return ticket, but still several hundred HKD less than what I paid in upgrade for the premium flex ticket I had originally purchased. "

Flight on time, cabin crew friendly, pre-ordered meal arrived on time and hot, additional purchase prices for beverages are reasonable, pilots are informative, and your seats can recline on this budget airline in the newest aircraft. The fare is also very competitive. I could not ask for more. The only downside is KLIA2, low cost airport which is a shame, but this is not airline's fault."

However, definitely i will fly AirAsia again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Osaka Kansai to Bangkok,April 2018,3.0,5.0,,,,4.0,4,yes,8," Went on an overnight flight from Osaka to Don Mueang Bangkok. The staff were lovely. One flight attendant in particular was very cheerful and made everyone laugh (and even applaud) as he sang in Thai over the intercom. Flight attendants are usually a little robotic so it was nice that the whole team seemed to be having fun on this one. I have found AirAsia flights to be very cold, so bring some layers!"

Always check to see if baggage is included. I checked in for my flight online and did not see any information about baggage.  I assumed since I was flying international maybe they would not charge for baggage. I am very aware that they are a budget airline but I did not see a place to purchase baggage while checking in or I would have. I think you must have to pay for baggage when you purchase your ticket. Their staff at the Siem Reap International Airport was unprofessional and very unaccommodating, “we are a budget airline” is what they kept telling me when I asked why I was being charged for my check-in luggage. The baggage cost me $80 USD, it was only 11kg. The cabin service was just fine."

First time to Bali and bought these tickets on this airline based on price, did not really do any research before hand. The service on this airline was fine, I really had no complaints, the flight left on time, the seats were fine for the short flight that it was and the employees at check in and in the airplane were very nice. My only complaint is that due to my age and bad legs, boarding was done having to go down steps from the terminal to the tarmac and then up the stairs to the airplane. Similar situation upon arriving in Denpasar. Not the end of the world, just that those behind me had to suffer with my lack of speed down and up the stairs."

We needed to pay close to 4,000 baht just to check in our bag (weighing 23 kg). When we got on the flight the seats were so close together. They expect you to pay for any sort of beverage or snack during the flight- this includes water. On the way back, we decided to try to skip the hidden baggage fees and pay for it online, only we couldn't. Every time we tried to do so, we were met with the warning that their site was experiencing a 'glitch' and that we had to do this at the airport. "

On the first occasion I have been lucky enough to get a glass of hot water, on the second attempt I have been asked to buy a bottle, but unless you have MYR with you or a credit card you won't be able to get any water. PA s never stop, On one flight i have counted 25 that drive you crazy, trying to get you to buy any sort of things. You can just notice how they save and make money looking at the aircraft: one of them on the inside was covered with advertisements even on the table and the hand luggage compartment. Emergency doors they have two rows of seats on the immediate left and right of them, the so called 'vip seats' where for an extra 20 dollars you have extra leg space. If you are unlucky to seat on row 11 in front of them, your seat will not recline and if you are tall 1.90m like my husband and someone reclines the seat in front of you, you have no space for your legs.

Originally flight from Jakarta to Singapore was canceled and we were rebooked 5 hours later. Multiple calls to support went unanswered. No response after two days to email ticket created through their support website. No response on Twitter. Service desk at CGK was vacant.

They allowed passengers to check in at 11.00 am but didn't inform them about the delay. Once the immigration process was completed, then they changed departure time to 07.00pm. Now passengers don't have any option other than waiting. There wasn't any AirAsia executive present at the gate. We also didn't get any vegetarian food at Bali Airport. The airline provided food as it was delayed, but they ordered Non-Vegetarian food only. They should have some common sense that Non-Vegetarian people can eat Vegetarian food, but Vegetarian people cannot eat Non-Vegetarian food. Most of the co passengers were absolutely frustrated. They promised us that they would provide Vegetarian food on the flight. But when flight departed they told us that you have to buy it. I really will not recommend this AirAsia to anyone. While going to Bali from Mumbai, one flight attendant told me that currency exchange rate with AirAsia is different. Generally 1 INR = 210 IDR(app). But with Air Asia, 1 INR = 100 IDR. That was so pathetic. I wanted to choose twin seats while web checkin. The Customer support misguided me. They told me there wasn't any twin seats available in flight so I ended up booking different seats paying equal amount. And actually twin seats were there. This airline is bearable for those whose height is less than 165 Centimeters and a journey of max 3 hours. I will not travel via Air Asia again even if they provide me free tickets. I will not target the inflight entertainment and seating comfort as it is a low cost carrier. We should not expect more from it. It is just a plane which have seats with little cushion onto it. It take off from source and lands at destination. That's all. I hope this review will be valuable for all future travelers."

So I called the customer support and moved it to 10:45am, which took me almost 45 minutes to finish the phone call. It wouldn't bother me until they told me my flight would delay to 14:35 on 30 March. I called to confirm and they told my flight was still the same time. As soon as I arrived KUL airport, I found my flight delayed to 14:35, then I asked them to move my flight to the 12:00 one, they refused my ask cause I didn't change it 48 hours ago according their policy. They changed my flight within 48 hours and ask me to make a change before 48 hours?! The woman in the counter was unwilling to face the sentences stated in the email that If the new flight is inconvenient to you, please contact our Customer Support for either one of the following options: 1. Change your flight to another time/date within 14 calendar days from the original departure date or rquest for a credit account of the value of your booking which is to be redeemed within 90 calendar days from the issuance date for your future travel with us or equest for a full refund of the value of your booking. She said she can call her supervisor but the answer would still be the same. After the call, she said although my supervisor still not agree, I can change your flight. So booking airasia can save a little money but waste time. "

The plethora of reviews surrounding this airline do not lie. To save time, let me first list the positives of my flights and then the problem areas. Positives: No delays. Flight arrivals were timely. Unloading was fast. Wifi was available for free. Problems: No staff acknowledgement getting on the plane to any passengers. Did not have Malaysian currency (coming from Vietnam) and was not allowed to pay by credit card so that I could have a bottle of water! Cue tip in the seat pocket from previous flight. Decor is most budget I have seen, carpet does not cover the whole floor of the plane and the stains/tears in the leather seating is obvious. Staff (not all) lacked a positive attitude toward the passengers. The rest is what you would expect from a budget airline i.e. tight, uncomfortable seating, no in-flight entertainment, no complimentary food/beverages, complimentary wifi was limited, no power supply, etc. This is a classic point A to point B service, which was delivered. However, there is budget flying and then there is Air Asia budget flying. Do not recommend."

I have requested AirAsia customer service to compensate me for cancelling my tour and my outbound flight because I have to cancel my trip to Luang Pabrang due to Air Asia re-scheduling my in-bound flight.

I have been frantically trying to contact them via calls, emails, live chat, twitter, facebook since March 1. None of these methods work. There was no reply whatsoever from their customer service. I've tried calling every one of their physical office but none of the numbers work. There is no way to contact them at all.   Seat and aircraft dirty and magazine is never complete.

We caught 4 different flights with air Asia and only 1 ran on time. Delay after delay, said were boarding was at 10.20pm to still not being boarded at 11.15. Booked all my travel with my partner, requested to be seated together. When checking in not sitting together so I had to fork out $100 to choose new seats to sit together, after doing that on our last flight back to Sydney we find out AirAsia have moved our seats again and we are not sitting together.

I arrived at check in 3 hours before the flight and proceeded to check in. At check in my wife was questioned as she was traveling on a Russian passport and even though we live in Singapore and provided evidence the staff still had a long discussion in Malay about whether to check her in. Eventually they did and they gave us our boarding passes. I  asked if we were all sat together and the check in agent clearly said yes. It wasn't until we got to immigration and i was asked to show our boarding passes when i saw they had my 2 year old daughter sat in a different row to my wife and I. This was very frustrating as it also happened on my flight from Singapore to Kota Kinabalu where the  check in staff told me i had to pay them if we wanted to sit together. I challenged the way the seats were allocated in Singapore to be told that it wasnt anything to do with them it was a computer who allocated seats. Clearly the computer doesn't have a family or doesn't want to sit with its family if it ever travels. The staff were not helpful at all in Singapore, it was only when i got onto the plane and spoke to the cabin crew did we find staff who were helpful and then helped us sort out seats together. On the flight from Kota Kinabalu to Singapore i had to speak to the gate agent who helped us find seats together. I dont understand why Air Asia cause families problems at check in when they can clearly accommodate seats together. Why add extra anxiety and why cause cabin crew or gate staff more problems because the check in staff cant be bothered to help customers? Low cost airlines splitting up families so they can earn extra revenue is being investigated in the UK and the US Senate has stopped airlines splitting families. "

Wrote e-mail to customer service to change to a later flight and add luggage, since web-site does not work - no answer in over 24 hours. Travel-date is 48 hours after my request, so I have purchased tickets with another airline. In KL there is full immigration, security check and customs at arrival and the same extensive checks on departure - so transit is a few hours hard work. I am 1.80 cm, too much for the allotted space.

Again I regret travelling by this airline. The customer service and support is zero. I needed to take a medicine and asked for water by pressing the Assistance button above our seat. The air hostess came and asked me what I needed, I said water. Then very conveniently she forgot that. I mean do they teach them the meaning of that button? Very unfortunate that such a big name has such poor quality service. Thank you for giving me another reason as to why I am definitely not going to travel AirAsia again."

When I was planning the trip to Langkawi, AirAsia offered the cheapest tickets. So the price was the main factor while choosing AirAsia and I must say it was really good value for money. I checked in online and everything was really easy. At the airport we had to wait about 15 minutes in the queue for the bag drop, but that was totally normal. Boarding process was well-organised. The staff on-board was very kind and helpful. The legroom was quite short for me, but as the flight took only one hour, it was easily bearable. In conclusion, it was really good decision to take AirAsia for such a short flight, as their price was unbeatable and they offer really good variety of services for additional cost, which are very convenient."

We have now been flying with this airline 3 times, and two of these times we had delays for around 1 hour. When flying back from Puerto Princesa we were asked to check in what had been our carry on baggage going here. The bags weights were less than 10 kilos, soft, full of clothes, and size is according to normal standards for airlines and our previous flights with air Asia. When we asked for the reason they told its due to safety reason.  So we had to pay the check-in fee and board. "

Waited in line for about 20 minutes at Jogja to check in, but the line moved fairly quickly. My hand luggage was over 7kg so I bought extra baggage allowance, but the ground staff at Jogja never weighed my hand luggage. Boarding started at departure time so we got off the group 30 minutes late, but we arrived on time at KUL. Crew was attentive. Seats were reasonably comfortable. Announcements were frequent and easy to understand. Overall I was satisfied with this AirAsia flight."

Bad to worse from the start because I had a renewed passport (even though I showed them the old passport). On the return leg from KUL to SGN, whilst boarding I was pulled out of line, both the old and new passports taken off me (which I eventually demanded back). The staff checking boarding passes was suspicious of anyone handing her a smartphone boarding pass. What's the point of using the AirAsia App if we get dirty looks when using it for storing boarding passes? Anyway, her supervisor contacted his supervisor using WhatsApp then after sending pictures of my passports to him, I was finally allowed to board.  After boarding, the flight attendants serving food want to see your boarding pass, which means if you have it on your phone (and you are sat at a window seat) you have to pass it to be inspected. "

Our flight was delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft and ATC tech issues. AirAsia informed us about the first delay on 11:30pm the day before our 7:45am flight, while this could have happened faster I was still able to adapt to it. After boarding we waited an other 60 min with very sparse information about why, roughly in the middle of wait we were informed that there are problems with ATC and at some point later we pushed back without further announcements. The seats were fine but had little comfort.  No IFE or WIFI available. AirAsia is fine for the price if everything works, if you have a problem you have a big one. Our return flight was rescheduled and offered to refund or rebook. I tried to rebook. To me the saving on airfare is not worth the very real possibility that you will spend a lot of energy and time being stressed by AirAsia messing up."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Phuket,January 2018,1.0,4.0,,,,2.0,3,no,3,"  Kuala Lumpur to Phuket delayed arrival of 45 minutes. I used this airline for the first time, with 4 flights in January and every flight was delayed, the one from Bali to Kuala Lumpur was a 3 hour delay. Rubbish time keeping."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320-200 neo,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur,January 2018,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,3.0,5,no,3," The new seats were very small and not very comfortable. The old seats for the old A320-200 were a bit bigger and a bit more comfortable. For some reason the day I flew was a very nice day to fly but for some reason the turbulence was very extreme, the pilot had to cancel the distribution of meals because of it which I believe was not turbulence, it was the pilot using the plane on manual instead of using the autopilot. The flight was 50 minutes delayed but somehow made it 10 minutes late to its actual arrival time. I was happy for that but other than that it was the worst AirAsia experience. Note: The ticket was very cheap."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320-200,Business,Economy Class,Surat Thani to Bangkok Don Mueang ,January 2018,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,4.0,5,yes,7, Flew from Surat Thani to Bangkok Don Mueang for business. Booked for luggage and thus had a hot seat and also a meal. The service was standard Air sia and standard budget airlines. The staff members were polite as how usually budget airlines goes. Seat pitch at my seat (1D) was pretty OK. However I still cannot imagine taking budget airlines for long haul flights.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Kota Bharu to Kuala Lumpur,January 2018,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,10," Flew Kota Bharu to Kuala Lumpur. Air Asia have made a lot of improvements especially in terms of punctuality. Staff were friendly. They even took the initiative to wish one of the passengers a happy birthday through an announcement. Cabin was clean, flight was on time and more importantly super value for money. The only thing lacking is probably inflight entertainment - but you dont really need it for such a short distance journey."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Bali,January 2018,3.0,2.0,,,,2.0,1,no,3,  Singapore to Bali. Have taken many flights with Airasia which have been largely positive. My last experience I arrived late (20 minutes before departure) and was prepared to be refused to board the plane. I was surprised to have to pay 3X my original fare to buy a later flight.  I could have made my original flight had I been allowed to proceed without issue initially as I had no baggage to check in etc. Extremely disappointed.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vientiane to Kuala Lumpur via Bangkok,January 2018,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,3,no,2,"  Vientiane to Kuala Lumpur via Bangkok. Worst flight experience I ever had. The only reason I went to the check in counter at my first leg of the flight was to see whether I was correctly checked-in since I booked through a 3rd operator. Showed my boarding pass on my phone, that was all fine, and then they gave me a paper boarding pass. While boarding, I showed my boarding pass on my phone, as I had put my paper boarding pass away, they acted like I was from another world having a boarding pass on my phone. They took me out of line, saying paper boarding pass all taking my pasport out of my hands. Then at my stopover, I couldn't transfer like I normally would on connecting flights, because my boarding pass had to be verified.  Really inconvenient to say the least, almost missed my connecting flight because of it. "

We booked 6 months before and we got a very good price lower than many others. True that you need to pre-book your meals and baggage allowance. But all went smoothly. The quality of their service is very satisfactory! However selling food and Duty free items on board is bit unprofessional.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Penang,December 2017,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I bought tickets for Kuala Lumpur to Penang return. At Penang airport I reached check in 30 minutes before flight time. However, they refused to let me board and simply said I had to purchase tickets with their next flight as gates are closed. The money I had paid for the flight was wasted and I was forced to purchase another one way ticket to KL from the airport with Malindo Air. I could understand if it was an international flight, but the fact that they refused to allow me to board with 30 minutes remaining is unacceptable."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kochi to Hyderabad,December 2017,3.0,3.0,,,,2.0,2,no,4," Flew Kochi to Hyderabad. Worst customer service ever experienced. Flight got delayed for 3 hours and delay was notified after the actual departure time by SMS. When I checked with the AirAsia desk about the delay, they didn't even seem to know that the flight was delayed 3 hours. I don’t want to travel with AirAsia again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Ho Chi Minh,December 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,  We had a trip from Kochi to Ho chi Minh with 1 stop to Kuala Lumpur. Both of our flights were delayed. The first one for over 1 hour and the second for over 3 hours. The seats inside the aircraft are small. We ordered something to eat inflight and most things on the catalogue were missing and the food was very little for one person and the cabin staff didn't have enough change to give you back. I will not travel with this airline again for sure.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Bali,December 2017,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Flight was cancelled due to the Bali volcano situation. My flight was several days after the 1st sign of eruption, no updates were provided on the potential cancellation. I was notified a few hours prior to the departure. No proper communication on how to seek refunds. I had to do my own research to find out how to get the refund. After I made the submission, I had to contact them more than 4 times in the past 21 days with no updates. On 3 out of the 4 occasions, the customer service staff I chatted to ended the conversation abruptly without a conclusion. To hang up while someone is talking is very unprofessional. Their website couldn't find my refund status record too. During the Bali volcano eruption period, Jetstar offered their affected customers an alternative flight to another Jetstar destination.  AirAsia was silent throughout this period."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Denpasar Bali,December 2017,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Perth to Denpasar Bali booked for 2nd December. Waited on hold the day before flight was cancelled to be told your flight tomorrow will depart as scheduled. Needless to say flight didn't go anywhere. I asked air Asia on the phone if there was any way that I could fly from my original departure city (Perth) - to anywhere in Asia within two weeks - was told no that is not possible by the most useless manager. Offered to change my flight to some time within 28 days to Bali (original route). After arguing for a refund for over two hours, I was offered no refund. Two days later AirAsia release a statement that they're going to offer everyone who bought tickets for this flight full refunds. 17 days, 3 emails, 3 phone calls, 2 Facebook conversations later, and several failed attempts to use the down for maintenance Air Asia app and website, I still have no refund."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Singapore to Bangkok,November 2017,1.0,,,,,1.0,3,no,1,  Singapore to Bangkok. My luggage was damaged. Counter at the airport was closed as there were no more flights from AirAsia. Wasted an hour on the phone trying to contact their customer service and received forms to fill up for the to even begin processing my request. The hoops you have to jump though in order to get a token refund from this airline is appalling. I found out that they have removed their review feature from their Facebook page. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Krabi to Jakarta via Bangkok,November 2017,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,2,no,2," We were travelling from Krabi to Jakarta, via Bangkok and when we arrived to Jakarta our luggage didn't arrive. We reported it lost at the CBTO office, they told us our bag was left behind in Bangkok and that they were going to send it back to Jakarta the next day at 3pm. We were flying back to the US next day so we couldn't claim it. It has been already 3 days since they got our luggage at CGK airport and they haven't done anything to get it back to us. We've been calling them many times and they either don't answer their calls or when they answer they hang up on us or they require us to provide a report ID number from the airline we flew back home so they can handover the bag to them. But, it's not that other airline's fault and because they don't have my luggage they can't give us a report ID number. It's not our fault, it should be the airline's responsibility to send the luggage to us. It has been a nightmare trying to get them send our luggage. Very inefficient staff in Jakarta. They don't respond to our emails and don't say anything about what they'll do with the luggage."

✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Bali,November 2017,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Singapore to Bali. First and last time traveling with this airline. We paid double the fare to board ourselves to a later flight in the day due to arriving late at airport. The check-in staff assured us to board us onto the next flight. The price difference is nothing short of predatory pricing. AirAsia insists on an all-in tix plus luggage overweight charges, airport taxes and everything else. Fine, we did as per their recommendation and waited 2 hours to the ""next flight"". But the airline delays an extra 2 hours (this is only a 2 hours flight) and our first day of the vacation is almost over. Do yourself a favor and book Tiger/Scoot next time. "

This was my second worst flight experience ever. It is absurd that they do not offer Fly Thru service for International flight connections. It is absurd how small the pitch is between seats. It is absurd they will fill up an A320, with no one in the exit rows because that costs extra, and kick a passenger who relocated there during the flight, how many advertisements are in the plane and that after collecting our baggage and passing through customs, simply to catch a connecting flight, the Checkin Agent insisted I pay cash for an outrageous overweight bag fee because he didn't feel like entering my credit card information into the computer. This is 2017, I can pay anyone for lunch with Venmo, but paying a major airline for a fee is difficult? Are you kidding me? It is absurd they woke me up to hand me a meal which I did not order, only to realize that the meal was for someone else, so they took the meal away.  Wifi on plane? Advertised but doesn't work. Seat entertainment? Not on any planes. T"
✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Shantou to Bangkok,November 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,2,no,2," Shantou to Bangkok. With my knowledge having boarded AirAsia I simply lowered my expectation of inflight service to zero. Beautiful flight attendants were there greeting me. The plane took off as scheduled. The meal plan I pre-booked is served at a comfortable pace. They were using 2 flight attendants, one is to do everything and another is just to stand there and hand out the food. I have no idea whether it is the best way of serving on board but I see many flight attendants who are serving passengers more actively. They refused my Chinese money once I ordered a can of coke. I have given them 14RMB, the flight attendant returned me with 2RMB and said it is too old. As a passenger I can't the control or reject the legal money given to me from a supermarket, can I? Can they refuse legal bank notes?"
✅ Verified Review ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi,November 2017,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,10,  I flew on Air Asia from Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi on November 9th 2017. Everything on this trip was excellent. Refreshments were available for purchase. Boarding was handled efficiently aided by the new design at terminal KLIA2. Was given seat 1B as the flight was full and I did not have to pay extra for boarding first.
✅ Verified Review ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bali to Phnom Penh via Kuala Lumpur,November 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,2,no,3," Bali to Phnom Penh via Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia. In Kuala Lumpur there was a delay of more than 2 hours. Staff and company gave zero information about the delay. Moved to another gate, waiting for another flight to arrive and than just before boarding gave us a bottle of water, for over 2 hours of waiting. Even a meal does not compensate this delay. AirAsia is a budget airline with next to no service. Booked my ticket online and they charged me 10% for using my debit card, $48. Ridiculous. This amount does not show before you agree to pay. Do not fly. I prefer a regular airline."

✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bali to New Delhi via Kuala Lumpur,November 2017,1.0,4.0,,,1.0,5.0,3,no,2,  Bali to New Delhi via Kuala Lumpur.  No inflight entertainment and no free food given on flight. One has to pay. They defend that position by calling themselves a budget airline. Seats are uncomfortable. I'm  going to pay extra and travel with some other airline next time. The positives are that the staff is courteous and the flight is on time always. In fact they're before time.
✅ Verified Review ,A320-200,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Bangkok (DMK) to Male,October 2017,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,1,no,1,"  My wife and I just returned from a trip to the Maldives on flights FD 177 and FD 178 (Bangkok – Male) on 26 Oct and 31 Oct and I must say they were the worst flights we have ever experienced. We paid extra for the Premium Flex package. To start things off, we thought the flight would depart from the International terminal at Don Muang airport. The only thing departing there was the long bus ride from the far northern end of the airport to the extreme southern end where the plane was parked. A few meters more and we would have boarded from Ram Intra Rd. The plane then taxied back to the far north for take-off. Why couldn’t a concourse gate be used? While inflight we expected to get our pre-ordered meals which were ordered when the flights were booked in April. No way. Instead we were given a bland rice dish instead with no explanation as to why and a small bottle of water. On arrival in Male our express handling of baggage was anything but. I counted nearly 40 bags of normal baggage before our luggage appeared on the belt. So much for “express handling”. The departure from Male on 178 was delayed by the late arrival of 177 from BKK. Why a turnaround flight originating in BKK should be late (first and only flight) is beyond comprehension unless it was mechanical, but then no explanation for the delay was ever given to the passengers. It finally departed for BKK 1 ½ hours late (14.05 vs 12.35). In addition, there was no priority seating except that we were able to get on the bus first followed by remaining passengers on the flight until the bus was full. And again we were given the same rice dish we got on the outbound flight. This time we argued with the attendants about failure to provide what was ordered. One of them had the guts to tell us that ""This is what you ordered"". I told her it was not what we ordered and that Air Asia thinks it can serve premium customers whatever it (Air Asia) wants. Cash customers got what they ordered. We refused to eat that rice and my wife had to pay to get a drink and a candy bar to eat and drink. My wife overheard 2 attendants saying that at least 10 pre-ordered meals were not provided to people on that flight. Arrival in BKK again put us in a closed down section of the airport (old domestic terminal parking bays) and again bussed to the northern end of the airport. Again, no priority – everyone (136 passengers) were crammed into one bus at the top the terminal. So I ask you, would you put up with this type of service when paying premium fares for so-called better service? "
✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Alor Setar,October 2017,1.0,4.0,,,,1.0,2,no,1," I flew with AirAsia 6 timea this past 2 weeks, not a single flight was on time. There was zero courtesy shown by staff to the peaple they are delaying. The airline showed zero responsibility towards people with connecting flights on the same airline or other airlines. I hated every minute with them. All this while forgetting it was not really a budget choice nor was there any added value for the cost."
✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chiang Mai to Kuala Lumpur ,July 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Flew Chiang Mai to Kuala Lumpur. AirAsia are cheap, but that's all they have going for them. The experience I have with them is as follows: Deceptive - they add lots of charges and it's hard to navigate their online system to avoid the extra fees. Website crashes - as said above, their site is 'tricky' to navigate. I think it's deliberate, to trick you into buying extras you don't want and to gain revenue from inadvertent double bookings of flights. Customer service - there is none of this at AirAsia. None. Ziltch. I asked for help and they arrogantly didn't listen, instead just threw 'policy' or 'rules' at me. There is no compassion, no fairness, nothing. Just everything their way. They won't even provide an escalation process if unhappy with their ruling. Unfair and unjust. Small seating - the seats are too small for taller people. I hate that. I will never book an Air Asia ticket again. Instead, I'll go Scoot or Jetstar - these companies have a heart and actually care about service."
✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Penang to Kuala Lumpur,October 2017,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,3,no,1," AirAsia needs to step up its game! Flying from Penang to Kuala Lumpur so many times and most of the time the flight is always delayed by an hour plus. Same thing happened again this time, another delay by an hour plus. This is a joke, I have other flight to catch and life to live. The ticket price gets more expensive but service is non-existent. You are being hauled and hushed quickly by the staff and the prided best customer service is a joke. Not consistent and hard to get. Overprice F&B, seat selection and old entertainment and uncomfortable seating arrangement. I will go with a full service carrier in the future!"
✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kalibo to Kuala Lumpur,October 2017,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,3.0,5,yes,10,"  I flew from Kalibo heading to Kuala Lumpur via AK609 on 14.25pm - 24 Oct 2017. Before boarding, I caught a fever. I asked for panadol from the crew and they were very responsive providing me with the medicine together with hot water. I had pre-ordered the in-flight meal of coconut rice and they were very kind to offer to help me change to a sandwich in order for me to eat the sandwich before taking the medicine. They came around offering me hot water from time to time. In conclusion, we really enjoyed the personalized service and value for money despite this being a budget airline. The cabin crew were friendly and very helpful."

Contacted AirAsia and they didn’t have any availability anymore on the day, but promised to give credit or somekind of proportioned refund for the original ticket, so long I provided all the documents requested. Which I did, I sent all the hospital letter and death certificate. Now 2 months later and still no response from the airline, I tried to contact the by email a few times already.

This is the first time I have experienced bad service by air Asia, and it happened in their KL terminal 2.  My wife booked a ticket for me to go to India via KL, but she booked it under my nick name because domestically in the Philippines I travel under that name. The ticket we bought however does allow passenger name change, but there is a fine print which is a total con. The chat service and customer support just kept throwing us back and forth and finally when we pushed they promised that it will be refunded we just have to buy another ticket for the moment. Well this happened December 2016. Till now no answer, just a template answer saying no refund because the name is different. To me, I don't care about the money it's a small issue. I still fly air Asia when there is no other airline available for the price and time, but if there is a better airline, I take that instead."

AirAsia always gave me a good journey to reach my destination, but one thing i dislike about the airline is the lack of inflight entertainment. I know its a low cost airline but that doesn't mean that they can't implement inflight entertainment. The  seats are small espeically the leg room,  but they are uncomfortable and quite disappointing."
✅ Verified Review ,A320-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lampur to Bangkok DMK,September 2017,4.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,9, It was a morning flight departing KUL at 8:20AM and arriving DMK at 9:30AM. Flight departed and arrived on time. Proper announcements were made by the cabin crew and the pilots. Cabin crew on this flight were pretty active. Aircraft had a special livery (Allstars Livery)(reg no 9M-AFD). Interior of the aircraft was pretty worn out and the aircraft had started to show its age. Did not pre-order anything or buy onboard anything.
✅ Verified Review ,A320-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bhubaneswar to Kuala Lumpur,September 2017,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,2.0,4,yes,7, AirAsia charges its passengers for practically everything that it possibly can. Did web check-in 14 days prior but could not select seat of my wish free of charge. Was alloted a seat by the system randomly. The ground service at Bhubaneswar airport was pathetic with the airline staff not clear about the transit rules. There was no line at check-in counter and people were literally crowding at the counters to get their check-in done. flight departed 15 mins late but arrived on schedule. The staff were a little cold on this flight. Did not have any issue with seat pitch (my height is 164cms). The pilot made periodic announcements regarding flight progress which was nice. Had pre-ordered kabali biryani which was served with coke. Quantity of the meal was fine.
✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Padang to Kuala Lumpur,August 2017,2.0,4.0,4.0,,,2.0,1,no,2,"  I bought a ticket Padang - Kuala Lumpur in february 2017 for a flight in August. With this flight we had 6 hours in Kuala Lumpur to catch the other flight. After a month I a got a message of a reschedule for about two hours later. It still should be enough for the transfer in Kuala Lumpur. On the day of departure when we arrived at the ariport a next reschedule of the flight. This means about two hours for transer. This is very tight for a transer in Kuala Lumpur, due to the two different terminals. We informed the AirAsia staff, they arranged a Priority luggage handling. The man took a picture of our passport and ticket and send it to Kuala Lumpur to inform the office there and probably inform the Oman Air counter, our connecting carrier. Finally, at the gate we waited for three hours to found out that the flight was delayd for almost an hour! The plane had a fast and smooth trip to Kuala Lumpur. At arrival we ran to the luggage band, picked up our luggage as first and run to the next terminal. At the second terminal we found out that the connecting flight of Oman-Air has left already.  The result was that I had to buy 4 new tickets to Amsterdam. Back home filling in the e-form and ask for help or compensation. But the only response of Air Asia, sorry we are not responsible. We can not be charged for costs due to delay or rescheduling. This means that you cannot trust AirAsia if you have a connecting flight. If you cannot trust the schedule you better don't fly with AirAsia.  Im sorry because the flight and onboard service is okay. The lesson is that a cheap ticket can turn to be very expensive."
✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bali to Hong Kong via KL,May 2017,2.0,2.0,,1.0,,1.0,4,no,2,"  I was travelling from Bali to Hong Kong, where I had to transfer at KL. I only had a cabin size suitcase, and a drawstring backpack with me. I have been travelling with AirAsia many times in the past, due to the it's competitive price, even though the seats are uncomfortable, but I don't mind it for short hauls. I have always been using the same cabin size suitcase when travelling with them. So size wise, I know my suitcase is definitely fine. For my drawstring backpack, anyone who has one knows you can't really put much in it. I only had my personal documents in the bag, plus a jacket to use while on the flight. After I finished checking in, a guy stopped me and wanted to weigh my luggage. The total weight of my 2 pieces were just slightly over 10kg (the total permitted weight is 7kg for AirAsia). This is exactly what I came with, perhaps less. I threw away an old top and flip flops after this trip too. They weighed my luggage on my outward flights, I can't remember the total weight for that, but they let me through, but gave me a little advice to make sure I was within limit the next time. However, on my return flight, this guy did not let me through, he took my boarding pass away, even when I told him I was running late, I only had less than 10min left before boarding time! He said I had to check in my suitcase. So I had to quickly rearrange things in my suitcase again! After all this messing around, my suitcase was finally ready for checking it, and I was charged IDR 800k for that! My flight was only IDR 1,380,400! I could have pay a little bit more, and flew with Cathay, which comes with 20kg check-in luggage, a much comfier journey with entertainment, plus direct flight. What really annoyed me was that after I went to the other side at the boarding gate, I saw so many people with over-sized luggage. I spoke to 2 staff there to make a complaint, but they ignored me. As soon as I landed, I sent an email to AirAsia to make this complaint, there were a lot of emails back and forth, but they were not willing to do anything about it. I'm fine if they want to follow their rules strictly, but please make sure it's consistent. "

For two days before the actual travel date we could neither reach the AirAsia listed telephone no, nor could we re-login. After boarding the flight we saw a vacant seat and offered to pay but we were not allowed. Same thing happened on the way back from Bali. Neither the online check-in works nor the telephone no. Customer Service is non-existent. There is no AirAsia counter in KL Airport for the service of en route passengers. Even water is not served, which is being too stingy. The A320s flying to India are too cramped. On the way back from Bali to KL, we were unfortunate to get the last row seats. besides the constant sound of the toilet flush, the Cabin Crew, who did not have much work, were chatting away at the top of their voices like excited school children. Flights were late by minimum 1 hour on all four legs. Overall one of the lousiest flights that we have travelled. No professionalism at all."

The check in was fair, but I asked to pay the baggage fee - I didn't know that the ticket fare I bought online was not covering baggage. The airport boarding room in Bandung was not too big, some passengers were standing. The flight delayed for 30 minutes. The ground staff didn't arrange the queue according to the seat area, so people started to queque 30 minutes before call. I was not aware about pre meal order and decided not to order on board. The seat space was enough for me, maybe near emergency exit was wider. For low cost flight, I think I would recommend AirAsia."
✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Changsha to Kuala Lumpur,August 2017,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," AirAsia is by far the worst airline experience I've ever had. I had four AirAsia flights in the last week for my trip to Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur and Penang and back to Changsha) three of which were delayed. The ticketing process is set up to be easier but many of the automatic machines were not working and we had to ask several staff members for help before we could print tickets. On the first 2 flights, the staff were unfriendly. On the last flight the staff were friendly but seemed exasperated by all of the requests of passengers. Carry on bags should be only 7 kilos but only one airport weighed our bags and made us repack them. There is no unity among the airline. Every airport has a different request. AirAsia is cheap because they offer you no amenities included in the price. Checked bags, food, and drinks are all an extra cost. Passengers may order food and drinks and pay cash on the plane but it was not an organized system. People were crowding the aisles and shouting at the crew to get what they wanted. The chairs are quite uncomfortable, when it was time for landing, I didn't even realize my seat was reclined. Many of the passengers used their cell phones at inappropriate times which made me very uncomfortable. I would rather pay for a more expensive flight than take AirAsia again."

I tried to get the website to allow me to select baggage but it did not work. When I tried to call the phone number they provide for the Vietnam office, it did not go through. As a result, I was charged 40USD to check a 15kg bag. The staff was rude and unaccommodating.  This may just be a problem with Air Asia in Hanoi. Aside from the booking process. They do not provide free water (let alone snacks) on flights as a low-cost airline. "

I am quite dissapointed with the service of Air Asia, they are not punctual with the schedule. Although they are cheap, they gave us poor service. On 7th July passengers were asked to proceed to the plane by bus. However, we were asked to stay in the bus for 30 minutes and asked to go back to the waiting room until further notice. Today, 4th August, using the same route, I experienced delay for my 21.00 flight. I just want to assure that cheap flights cannot degrade its service and punctuality, because, next time, I will rather use other airline (even more expensive one) in order to fly on time. "

There was a staff member on hand to assist if needed though.

There was an unintelligible announcement that was later claimed by the airline as last minute check-in announcement. I was denied check-in more than 45 minutes before the flight time, when the boarding pass clearly said that the gate closes 30 minutes before departure time, for a delay caused by the airline's poor line management. I was not offered the option to pay a chhange fee. Instead, I had to pay the price difference for a same day flight, which was between as much as I had paid for the whole trip, up to double that. This has been the worst customer service I have received from any airline, anywhere, and I travel a lot. Will never fly this airline again, nor recommend it."

We booked our flights online, and our reservation was changed by Airasia without notice. They changed the time of the flights, changed the bagages allowances, etc. That caused a big problem at Male airport in Maldives where the staff was especially not collaborating and unfriendly. We have big the victimes of their unfair online system as still had to pay the price for this. Booking on Airasia is like playing russian roulette. I started my trip at Krabi airport where my 22 kg bag was accepted as a 20 kg check in bag. Then the same bag wasn't accepted in Kuala Lumpur and I have to waste 10 minutes and make the queue even worst to take out things from my bag. On the way back from the trip, same problem at the Cebu airport. You can take 25 kg ++ carry on bags without paying a check in bag while people like me who try to respect the check in system are just treated rudely for 2 kg in excess. "

Malaysia's well-known low-cost airline with technically unbeatable fares, which is really like a local bus service. My flight was smooth, check-in for domestic flights is also possible at self check-in kiosks, so it saved a lot of time. Seats were a bit tightly packed and if you didn't order meal or not planning to buy duty-free stuff, there is no contact between you and the crew.

Now, my last flight to come back to Singapore is announced on last minute with more than 1h 30mins delay, supposing a technical issue. Staff disappeared and screen even not updated. This is a poor experience and the lower one I have experienced in Asia. Does it worth to waste time and money when again in theory you caught a good ticket fare. "
✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh City to Sydney via KL,March 2017,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1, Ho Chi Minh City to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia. I have to say this was the worst travel experience I have had. We bought our fares through an online booking service rather than the airline. On the way there it was bought as one package i.e. one flight to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur then connecting flight to Ho Chi Minh City and we also bought a package of 2 flights for the way back the exact same way online. When arriving at Sydney no problem for the airline staff to print us both boarding passes for the Kuala Lumpur flight and also the Ho Chi Minh City flight at the same time. On the way back different story. They said that these were two separate flight bookings that our online booking service had made for us. So in KL we then had to go through all their security and customs and then check our bags again and this took us about 1.5 hours. Many times I have brought my own decaf coffee with me on the plane as airlines never serve decaf coffee and I don't drink caffeine. I usually just ask them if I can have a cup of boiling water with some milk and I add my own decaf coffee.  I got told by a very nice air hostess that she would give me the hot water and milk (powdered) for free and that if I asked on another flight for this that I might be told to pay for a drink. There is no in flight entertainment and meals are not free as a low-cost airline. When you  pay for a meal on the plane you must pay in Malaysian currency or credit card. Then if you don't have credit card you can't purchase anything. Fortunately I had some US dollars in cash and they made a quick conversion and I paid in that for my items.

As bought value pack I was given a small bottle of water and small sandwich. In addition I bought a seat near exit row, so I felt comfortable and I think it worth the money paid.

✅ Verified Review ,,Business,Premium Economy,Kuala Lumpur to Bali,April 2017,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1,no,1,"  I first bought the upgrade pass in 2015 via Air Asia site and I purchased 6 upgrades to business class for more than the amount if you go directly to optiontown and request a non guaranteed upgrade but I thought the guaranteed one was worth the extra money. I simply had to directly book a business class seat. Then in 2016 when my pass expired I again went on the AirAsia site and purchased another 6 upgrades. What they didn't state clearly is that the pass no longer guarantees an upgrade, in fact it is useless as you are required to book an economy seat and then go onto the optiontown site and request an upgrade. So you pay a higher price and you have almost no chance of getting an upgrade. This is because Air Asia has already sold a huge number of these passes and has already obtained that money. So then if any business class seats are left, they heavily discount them. So for my new upgrade pass I received no upgrades. I even went on line and saw that there was only 1 business class seat left on a flight and although I had the pass, I paid the heavily discounted extra price of $800 so I could receive the seat. I then made a complaint and was told the pass could be extended, but this was a 1 off for 3 months only, and sure enough I didn't receive an upgrade during this time. My advice is to not buy an upgrade pass but take your luck and just try as a one off on the optiontown site, whereby if you don't receive the upgrade they at least refund your money. On the pass they only give you useless 'credits' which you will never use in the limited time period."
✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bali to Singapore,April 2017,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,2.0,1,no,1," AirAsia offer four flights a day to Singapore from Bali Indonesia. Unfortunately it is difficult to rely on any flight time as they have started consolidating flights to fill planes. My booking for the earliest flight was to allow time to take my daughter to Singapore for her 21st birthday. First flight in, last flight out would give us 12 hours in singapore. 2 days before the flight to Singapore AirAsia resheduled it, ok fair enough, it was only by 2 hours. But then 6 hours before the flight they rescheduled it again by 3 hours. Then to add insult to injury the rescheduled flight was also delayed by 50 minutes. We finally got to Singapore but our entire whole day shopping trip turned into only 3 hours. Why offer such an extensive array of flights you have no intention to fulfil?

AirAsia has to be one of the all around worst airlines I have ever flown. I don't write reviews, this is the first. I travel internationally a lot and am used to difficult situations and bad service. It takes a little effort to get me annoyed. Their website doesn't work very well. It constantly kicks you off. The website won't take any of my Visa cards. Because of this, I am forced to purchase tickets thru a 3rd party such as orbitz with the same cards where purchasing add ones such as baggage is not always an option. Some flights include a checked bag, others don't. So, if their website doesn't work and you can't pay in advance, you are left with getting ripped off at the airport on your bag fees. Inflight service is rude and narrow minded. For example, I booked meal service for a flight in February 2017 from Bangkok to Hanoi. I ordered a coffee in advance, however, after traveling all night, I decided to forgoe the coffee and sleep instead. I asked for a water and was told ""no, you must have coffee because it is what you ordered."" I said ""okay, I'll pay for the water"". Staff gave me an annoyed look and pushed the cart away. I was not rude, I was not demanding, but was treated very poorly. I ended up having to flag down another attendant and ask for a water. This was not an isolated incident. Similar things have happened to me before and I seen it happen to many others. Maybe my expectations are to blame here because of where I come from, but the capacity for abstract thought seems to be lacking within this organization. Being kind, courteous and compassionate is not a hard thing. Unfortunately, there is no recourse for me. They don't care. They are so big, it will be hard to avoid them in the future, but I'll will do my best to use other airlines."

One unpleasant experience on this particular flights; we were separated between KUL-SGN due to full flight - apparently and was advised to see ground staff at transfer desk KLIA2, where there was no help. We went to the boarding gate and they gave us 31B/31 C at the back of the plane. Once onboard, it wasn't a full flight, there are plenty of seats available. AirAsia system obviously cannot see that it was a single booking for two pax, hence they do not allocate seats for two."

AirAsia has terrible customer service and tries to overcharge passengers at every turn. I purchased 2 25 kg checked bags, but at check in, they claimed I had only purchased one, which resulted in by baggage being 11 kg over the weight allowance that I purchased. They then offered to check the remainder of my luggage for 42,000 won per kg, or 1.5 times the cost of my original ticket. They wanted 640,000 won for my 11 kg of checked luggage which they falsely claimed that I had not purchased. I am never flying AirAsia again."

Unfortunately I did not have a great experience. This is because throughout the entire flight two little kids kept grabbing the top of my seat like little monkeys. When they weren't dangling from my seat or my boyfriends seat they were kicking our seats, for 4+hours. The odd thing was that these kids did not seem to have a seat of their own, and were either sitting on their parents lap or torturing my boyfriend and I. I don't know that I can fault the airline for this, as we never voiced to the flight attendent what was going on. On a side note, I thought the airline provided plenty of decent looking food and beverage options."

I eat one portion in the flight and one in waiting next flight. I always love flying with Air Asia Indonesia because if the humble flights attendant. Although this is low cost carrier, they work professionally and friendly, like full service airlines. And this is always better than AK or D7. Delay in departure, on time in arrival. And I get high fare, because I see 25% lower price several days before flying. Overall okay and worth it."

I and my partner have always chosen to book with Air Asia as our preference for Asia. I booked and realised that I had the wrong date, it was the 22nd and not the 23rd. Okay, I should have seen this but I didn't. It may even have been the sites fault as I am so careful booking. I noticed this within seconds after the confirmation came in. I tried to call and after a wait of over 100 minutes, the call was answered. I was cut off by their agent. Infuriating and an absolute disgrace and contempt for their passenger. A wait of this length says it all about their attitude. Wait long enough so you hang up? The problem then goes away? I emailed 6 weeks ago and am still waiting for a reply. I had to book again and lose the first flight for both of us. Why do AirAsia not allow minor changes within a set time, say 12/24 hours? Not have a proper customer service centre that will call you back if wait times are over, say fifteen minutes or reply to your email? AirAsia has lost their shine for us."

Cheap flights but the seats are narrow and the pitch is not great for long distance flights. Only 29 inches pitch means you will struggle to sit comfortably if you are above average height. Front row (Row 1) seats and Exit Rows 12 and 14 have more leg room but no under seat storage in front of you and overhead lockers can be limited. If you book the front rows of seats (Rows 1 - 5, 12 & 14) at an extra cost you do get priority boarding so can manage to get luggage overhead. Service is good, on time departure if the flight arrives on time, you can book food at an extra cost but only a 1h 20m flight so not really needed."

Unless you have no money on you and no water, you are in trouble. Everything here has a price ticket, which was absolutely ridiculous on a 13 hour flight: since when do we have to pay for a human right (water). The leg space was so little, that my partner got cramps in his legs (he is nearly 2 meters) and even I (1.65m) was struggling being comfortable. Beside the lack of space, the staff were unfriendly, rude and didn't seem to be interested in their job at all. There was no onboard-entertainement and the check-in at Sydney Airport took nearly 2 hours. Yes, that is correct, we stood 2 hours in line to check in. Another reason why we would not choose AirAsia again is because of the fact that they left the lights on till 1am in the morning, while most people were trying to sleep. This broke us up, as we were so tired but couldn't sleep because of the lights. All in all, we wouldn't fly AirAsia anymore and strongly recommend to show up a few hours before your flight leaves, as the ground-staff were very slow. We had similair problems, a month later when we flew from Yangon to Bangkok: the airplane was a bit late and not cleaned at all. We were boarding the aircraft while the previous passangers hadn't even left the plane! Secondly, because of the lack of legspace, it will most likely be a very uncomfortable flight.

✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,CTU to DPS via KUL,December 2016,3.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Chengdu to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur. Most ridiculous flight I've ever experienced. Flying with two adults, an infant on lap and a two year old child. At airport early and possible to check baggage through to final destination, but couldn't print boarding cards or check in for second leg of flight. At transfer desk as soon as landed and five plus hours before second flight but still given three seats each several rows apart - including our two year old. Told that this was within policy since we had not paid extra to reserve seats together and there was nothing they could do but we could ask at the gate. Did that and told nothing they could do but should ask on board. On board told no, that was the policy and we couldn't change seats. Obviously not feasible to leave a two year old five rows away from nearest parent for a three hour flight, finally agreed could ask other passenger's if they'd mind swapping. Couldn't wait at front of plane or on bridge until everyone else had boarded though as that would delay boarding - he'd have to sit on his own until everyone else was in their seats and then we could try to swap if there was time before take off. In case you haven't met a two year old, getting him to sit next to strangers in a strange place with no parents in sight is unlikely to work and I imagine you'd probably get arrested for child cruelty in some countries. Eventually simply picked two random empty seats next to each other and pleaded with passengers to swap who thankfully took pity on us. Will not be flying Air Asia again, am amazed that their policy of two year olds sitting on their own is even legal."

Some days afterwards I received an e-mail from AirAsia saying the flight from Denpasar / KL was rescheduled leaving me 10 minutes between flights. There were 2 links: One for a telephone number which I called and whose lady said she couldn't help. Another for a chat that was consistently unavailable for 2 days. Also a e-form, which I used twice, but with no answer. The email itself couldn't be answered. After several tries on at least two days and two hours (in total) waiting, I managed to contact the live chat. I found out they would keep my money at least one month, if I'd cancel and ask for a refund. I had to search for alternative flights myself,on AirAsia website while chatting - they didn't help on any regard. In between, the chat was timed-out. So I had to wait again and managed to change the flight to the only option that allowed me to arrive on time at Manila. That forced me to stay overnight at KL. AirAsia didn't offer any compensation for that. I'm still waiting for the next e-ticket, and for the next chapter of this nightmare."

I don't normally use low cost airlines and this was only my fourth flight on a low cost and I fly at least 12 times each year. All previous flights where on AirAsia and only pretty short so I was a bit scepticle using them for this 4h+ flight. The direct options between Bali and Bangkok are limited to either Thai or AirAsia from what I can see, the AirAsia schedule suited me better so I choose the full package including luggage, Red Carpet Service, preferred seat, food and comfort kit. Check in was quick using the red carpet service which was also fully escorted from check in through security to the lounge. The lounge is old but so is the airport but fine to spend an hour with food and wifi. Boarding through gate 6a was done with priority and included a bus ride on my own as part of the red carpet service. Once onboard seat 1A was fine with enough space, not the most comfortable seat but okay. Crew where young but polite the food was also okay for airline food. Take off right on time with a flight time a little longer at 4h20m so landed a little late. Bags took a little time to arrive once off the flight at DMK. Otherwise a great flight and great service from the ground crew at DPS all for less than £100 which was half the cost of the nearest indirect option with the other direct option costing 3 times more."

If a problem is occurring, they are unable to attend to customers.  I made a booking for a flight and because the credit card interface did not work, I allowed them to debit my bank account for a ticket. The booking number is even mentioned in the bank account statement but they never sent a ticket. As I had to fly for business trip, I was booking the same flight on the same date again and paid with credit card (this time, it worked).  The customer is providing proof of double payment on the same day, is even giving the booking number of the flight where he did not receive a ticket and providing all information needed for a refund. AirAsia is choosing to ignore me. I tried as well on the counter at the airport in KL, they can't do anything. Therefore, I am now choosing to ignore AirAsia - it's a matter of principle. "

However, this time I felt really disappointed with their punctuality. The round trip Jakarta to Singapore, each trip was delayed 45 min to 1 hour. In addition of that, before take off and landing, the crew told the passengers that due to traffic on the airport, the aircraft had to wait for another 15 to 30 min. For me, that just could not be more annoying. AirAsia is no longer a budget flight. The price has gone up tremendously. It is often more expensive than Batik Air, the premium brand of the Lion Air group. Unlike Lion, I hardly heard anyone complaining about Batik problems such as delays. With competitors now offering better options and coming up with new promotions, I think AirAsia may start losing its grip. Check-in now has to be self-service and the early passengers can't choose their seats. It is now randomly assigned. Distance between rows is really narrow."

Booking and paying for a flight has never been more easy. Two days before the flight I received a reminder email including flight and departure/arrival terminal details plus a direct link to the online check in website . Save/print or screenshot the email and thats really all you need. According to the email the departure terminal was number 3, in reality it was terminal 2F. The difference is a 30.000IDR taxi drive that can take up to 30 minutes. This can make the difference between making it in time or being late. Very sloppy from Air Asia as they have greatly invested in a big marketing campaign at terminal 2F itself. Simple mistake, big consequence. Check in was easy, quick and efficient. All the check in desks could be used for all Air Asia flights. Boarding was done by a bus that brought us to an aerobridge which seems an odd thing to do but ok, it works. Boarding was a little late, as was the push back of the aircraft. Jakarta can be a very busy airport but this was not the case for this specific flight. Total delay before take off was about twenty minutes. The aircraft cabin had a pleasant cold temperature and the boarding process was relatively quick, although the aircraft was not full. The aircraft itself felt it needed a big cabin overhaul. Carpet was dirty and the safety card / inflight magazines were sticky and dirty. As we all know, this is a low cost carrier and we all enjoy the low fares. Air Asia's main focus is delivering value for money. But, is it necessary to have a pink, brown and greenish advertisement for a coffee company all over the overhead luggage bins? Service onboard was friendly and all crew spoke good English. I even got a free sandwich and a glass of water as it was included in my added cargo baggage package.  In terms of service it is all you want and need from a low cost carrier and more. "

✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,CCU to SIN via KUL,August 2016,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Flew AirAsia from Kolkata to Singapore via Kuala Lumpur. As per the itinerary there was 90 minutes to make the connection. The first flight arrived 30 minutes late to Kuala Lumpur so I only had about 30 minutes to run through security and make the 15 minute cut off for my continuing flight. KLIA is a very large airport and I was unable to make the cut off in that short duration to board the connecting flight. AirAsia took that as a no-show and made me pay 74 Singapore dollars as a ""change fee"" to board the next available connecting flight. Terrible on the part of Air Asia for doing this. This was an AirAsia reservation and if they know that 90 minute was insufficient, they should not put it on their website. Secondly, the mistake was not mine. Why did I have to pay 74 dollars?"

Seating with minimal leg room and they charge for water. The inside of the aircraft is plastered with advertising for one brand of jeans or another. There is no lumbar support in the seats and for tall people the headrest is in the middle of your back. The extra charges apply to everything and baggage is expensive. By the time you add in all of the extras might as well fly with a full far carrier. I will never fly again.

I had encountered some problems with my e-ticket which was quickly rectified with a call to AirAsia's office in Thailand without charges which was really appreciated. The plane coming in was delayed which affected our outgoing flight however there was very inadequate updates. This caused some passengers concerned who could be seen approaching the counter staff. The airline could perhaps put updates on the screen at the boarding area just to allay the passengers' concerns. On this occasion, the screen was showing last-call at 9.05pm for a flight that was scheduled to depart 25 mins earlier that evening at 8.40pm. The flight itself was as expected of a budget carrier.

Then I contacted them via Twitter and they informed me that I can opt for an earlier flight which was 2hrs earlier than my flight and I have to be put on standby at the airport, without any guarantee that I can fly then. I end up flying at 2050hrs instead of the original 1835hrs departure. Arrived at the airport and checked in.

Once onboard, the crew apologised for the delay many times and we very polite.

We were not seated together but expected to pay a fee to be seated together for two of the sectors. I booked 30 kgs of baggage as there is no free allowance for all three sectors but they only allowed me 20 kgs and wanted extra excess baggage fee. Their scales at KBV registered 5kgs more than the scales at DMG. Seat pitch bad which resulted in bruised knees when the pax in front recline his seat hard. Stewardess stated he had a right to do so but did not how I was feeling. Safety onboard poor with no one seated at the emergency exits as thes are added value seats. Money before safety. Third sector was late departing but no apology. There are cheaper alternatives if you look around. I am a regular flyer and this was possibly one of the worst experiences.

Inflight meal was served soon after the seat belt sign is off and passengers with pre-booked meal are on the priority. Majority of the passengers are originated from mainland China. Cabin crew are patient to answer and assist passengers despite the language barrier. I am impressed with the hospitality and service.

✅ Verified Review ,A320-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,WUH to BKI and return,March 2016,4.0,3.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,7,"  I booked the inauguration flight from Kota Kinabalu to Wuhan on 22 March 2016. Upon boarding, I found out that all crew were non Chinese speaking despite the large number of passengers from China. A big disappointment was that the crew made the safety announcement in Malay. Based on my observation, the crew had communication problems in assisting and handling the requests from passengers from the moment of boarding to arriving at our destination. I have flown a number of airlines in the region and in fact Chinese speaking crew are the norm for routes with high Chinese traffic. Return flight from Wuhan (WUH) to Kota Kinabalu (BKI). Wuhan International Airport is a rather small terminal with two rows of multiple check-in counters adjacent to each other. The check-in process started at 22.00 and was prompt. Boarding was smooth despite a number of flights departed at this time. Boarding was rather efficient without cabin crew greeting passengers as soon as they stepped onboard. Communication breakdown is unavoidable as all cabin crew allocated for this flight were non Chinese speaking crew. Soon after airborne, the cabin crew brought the meal cart out, no pre booked meals were served. About two hours later, I was woken by an announcement from the crew to inform any passenger who found a lost phone to return it to them. Having found no response, the cabin crew had no choice but to permit the passenger who lost her phone to make an announcement. This was not the first time I have experienced this situation. In my previous flight, one of the cabin crew had no choice but to turn to me to assist her to communicate with the passengers.

Get to connecting gate on time and there's no staff there to unlock the waiting area so people are sitting in the corridor on the floor waiting 20 minutes for staff to show up. Staff finally show up and the wait begins. People are expecting to board but we wait. After about 15 minutes I walk up to the gate desk and confirm that the flight is delayed. About ten minutes after this, someone at the desk gets the bright idea of actually proactively communicating this info to the rest of the passengers over the PA. We are given a boarding time of 7:25PM.  I leave and come back at 7:20 and we're still not boarding 10 minutes later. I ask again if the flight is going to be further delayed and I am told that 7:45 is the new time. I began to watch the customer service performance of the lady working the desk and I become amazed at how much basic training in customer service the staff are lacking. She gives no information until people come up and ask what time the flight is leaving. People wouldn't have been getting upset had they just had this basic info communicated to them. This way, people can make arrangements for their pickups from the airport, arrange a late check in etc. Pretty basic stuff. All told, this lady allowed 12 people to get so ticked off that they came up and angrily asked what was going on. She gave them all the same reply she gave to me, but it blew my mind that she never once picked up the PA and told everyone. She wasn't doing anything else really. All told the plane landed in Penang an hour late - not a huge deal but the manner in which this delay was handled was amateur."

I'd checked in online and it was a breeze through the baggage drop as most passengers seemed to have decided to check in old skool style. Plane was loaded efficiently and departed on time. With a favourable tail wind and lack of air traffic, we arrived in KUL half an hour early. Unfortunately there was a plane in our parking slot which hadn't departed yet, so lost 15 mins. The seat on the plane was pretty standard Air Asia legroom and recline -  not a great deal. But given the attractive price of my ticket, I'd say it was pretty good value for money. Couldn't really comment on the inflight service as I was asleep for the most part or playing games on my phone. As we seem to have been the first flight of the day arriving, some of the entry doors in the KLIA2 terminal were not opened, further eroding the gains from the early arrival. Quick through immigration and a long wait for baggage to be unloaded - this took about an hour. Also, quick through Customs checks.

On this flight from Singapore to Bali they use their standard A320, which is, well, standard and nothing special. However, their Premium Flex ticket provides many other advantages that I’m willing to pay more for. Extra luggage, express boarding, dedicated counter for check-in, an inflight meal, etc. For such short flights, which have become so commoditized, I like having choices that are clearly outlined and well priced. Plus the biggest benefit is that when you pay extra for a hot seat, I nearly always have the whole row to myself."

I explained that I had already done that but she said that I was not in the system. So I had to pay for seats again (and then were still not together). The flight itself was equally poor. Absolutely no legroom and there was no audio or video program for the 4 hour flight. The meal was laughable, we could not work out what was in the bread. The Bali return was much better as the representative was attentive and helpful. He found that we did in fact pay for seats online and offered to put us in the exit row with extra legroom for a minimum cost which we gladly accepted.

I've taken many of the budget airlines in Southeast Asia, but Air Asia remains my favorite. In fact, I think Air Asia may even be better than some of the full carriers in the area. I've flown Siem Reap to Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, Singapore to Bangkok, Bangkok to Chiang Mai, Chiang Mai to Singapore, Jakarta to Yogyakarta, and the Singapore/Jakarta route several times. I never had any problems with any of my flights. None of my flights were ever delayed, which definitely can't be said for the other airlines I've taken around Southeast Asia. Their app also works well, but it's only available for use at certain airports. The ground staff is can sometimes seem a bit course, but they are efficient and get the job done. Don't expect a luxurious ride, this is a budget airline after all, and you get what you pay for. The air staff is very nice and courteous. I've purchased food from them, which I found to be tasty and reasonability priced considering it is a budget airline and you're in the sky. They also sell a variety of things on board, but I've never purchased one of them. There isn't much for entertainment besides the travel magazine, but I've only ever taken short flights with them, so it's easy to entertain yourself with a book or your own device. There is not a lot of leg space though, which is to be expected, but if you are a larger person, you might want to consider purchasing one of the priority seats instead. Overall, i recommend Air Asia whenever you're looking for basic service to get you where you have to go quickly and cheaply."

Waited an hour before the operator repeated that the flight was cancelled but I told him there were other agents selling the ticket. He repeated the instructions of the email. I had also bought my hotel accommodations from Airasia and asked if I could cancel the entire trip. The operator could only cancel my flight and my hotel booking cannot be cancelled (my hotel cost more than the flight)! I asked what if I want to come back on the 3 Jan because my friend cannot apply for any leave. I was basically told that was my problem. Left without any real options, I requested a refund for my flights back from KL. My friend bought a new ticket from SQ returning on 2 Jan for less than S$100 and I return on 5 Jan for a ticket that was less than S$50. AirAsia gave us an option to fly back on the 5 Jan 2015 (the ticket cost less than S$50). I asked if I flew back on the 5 Jan 2015 with Airasia, would I receive a refund of the difference. The answer was no. "
,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,CEB to MNL,December 2015,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"We got delayed 6 hours from Cebu to Manila. While waiting, passengers were left in the dark for several hours since there was no ground staff in sight, the flight even disappeared from the main schedule board for a very long time. After almost five hours of waiting, a fellow passenger called the airline directly and finally someone showed up at the gate. The ""so called"" AirAsia representative was pretty much worthless in terms of knowing when we would leave. The only way I found out was by visiting the global flight status website which had all correct and updated information! I am aware this is a low cost airline, however, I rather pay more and indeed get some service. Will never use them again."

A very unplesant experience overall: Long and slow baggage drop-off process, flight delayed, most unconfortable, old and tight seats. Food and beverage only with cash as they accept no credit cards. They don't even give you a glass of water for free. They are cheap, yes, but if you look at what you get, they are actually extremely expensive."

Flight was delayed due to the traffic, however, we arrived KL only 10 mins after schedule. Cabin was clean and new, just the legroom was tight. Crew were very helpful and the inflight refreshments were available for sale on this short flight, price was adequate. Overall, I enjoyed this flight. Return flight to Singapore. KLIA 2 Check in counter staff friendly and helpful. Flight was on time, cabin was equipped with leather seat.  The AirAsia crew were very helpful throughout the flight. We arrived in Singapore ahead of schedule. AirAsia is definitely my prefered airline while traveling to KL"
,A320,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Siem Reap to Phuket via Bangkok,December 2015,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"Will avoid this airline. Beware of ridiculous checked baggage fees. We tried paying lesser fees online when we were checking in, but the AirAsia website conveniently skipped our baggage options no matter which option we tried to select. Then, at the check in counter, we had to pay $144 for 2 small bags (10 kilos each), even though we tried and tried paying that online ahead of time. When I told the clerk that I couldn't pay online, because I was told that this was my problem and I should have called the customer service. Don't pay for ""hot seats"" - that's another rip off. You get no extra legroom, but you do get extra 15 minutes in a stuffy cabin waiting for everyone else to board, because ""hot seats"" board first. If you want any food - prepay when you are checking in. Otherwise, you won't even get a glass of water out of them. Value for money - not so good. We paid $550 for 2 seats from Siem Reap to Phuket and then an extra $144 for the luggage, so this is not a low coster. Yet, their policies are those of a low coster: pay for printing boarding pass, pay for luggage, etc.

,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi,December 2015,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"The AirAsia flight we were supposed to board came in 2 hours late because of bad weather. Apart from this delay, we were made to wait another 2+ hours because there was no crew! I can understand the weather delay (although that could have been mitigated by ensuring a longer gap in between the landing time and take off time of a particular flight), but the non-availability of crew is inexcusable! Further, they decided to commence boarding of the next flight before us. "

Then when I got to the bag drop, the man said I was too early and if I left my bag they would lose it! I checked this several times and he confirmed 'yes, we will lose it, it won't make it to Sydney'. When I asked why, he said 'because no one will look after it'. So, can't get to the hotel I booked and have had to pay again to use a lounge to escape the noise."

Every flight to get to and from our final destinations were delayed, causing us to miss our connecting flight and having to be put on one 10 hours later, with no offer of hospitality we had to ask for a hotel to get some sleep and the assistant then took 2 hours to actually walk us to this hotel. When it was time to fly, our flight yet again was delayed, and our gates were changed without notification forcing us to run from from one end of the airport to another, the flight attendants were unfriendly and to finish it off our bags were lost.

Somebody spilt rice all over the floor of Row 10, but it wasn't cleaned up at all. My friend who sat on Seat 10F opened his meal tray and absentmindedly put his phone on it, only to find that AirAsia hadn't bothered to wipe the tray either. Although AirAsia is a budget airline, and this was a domestic flight, I still think that this is not acceptable.

,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,KUL to BKK,February 2015,3.0,4.0,2.0,,,3.0,4,yes,7,"This was my first time using ArirAsia, I booked a return flight from Kuala Lumpur - Bangkok. The flight was delayed by an hour on the way to Bangkok but this wasn't really a problem as it was an early morning flight so couldn't check in to my hotel anyways. We boarded the plane and it was clean and staff were welcoming. We arrived at Bangkok a little later then expected. On our return flight we ran into a few problems, upon arriving at the airport in Bangkok the flight was being showed as delayed and when we were checking in the staff informed that the flight was delayed due to a late departure from it origin airport. We sat in the terminal waiting for updates, one hour after we were supposed to depart we were allowed to board the plane and sat down in our allocated seats. The captain announced that the flight was going to be further delayed due to a faulty tire on the plane and it would take around 45-60 minutes to replace the tire. The captain kept us updated throughout the process, after roughly and hour we set off from Bangkok and were quickly in the skies. Thirty minutes into the flight I couldn't help but notice that the engine was making a very loud noise, it was a lot louder than usual. We circled the airport for around about thirty minutes when the captain announced we needed to re land at the airport due to engine problems. We landed back in Bangkok and were escorted to a terminal where we were told to await further instructions, we were given food vouchers while we had to wait and given the means to make calls. After a two hour wait we finally boarded and were on our way to Kuala Lumpur. We landed around five hours later than we were supposed to staff at the customer services were not very helpful and didn't really make and effort to understand passengers complaints. Other than the return flight it wasn't too bad and it was a budget airline after all."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Puerto Princesa,November 2015,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,2,no,2,"Friendly service, attractive staff, comfortable flight with AirAsia from Manila to Puerto Princesa. Customer service on the phone was helpful, but rigid and inflexible. After having a flight cancelled 2 days beforehand, I was unable to reschedule a flight back from Puerto Princesa for an arrival time to meet my international flight in Manila. As a result, I had to cancel all of my 3 flights back to the US, rebook my flight to Manila at 200% the rate that I originally paid, and then rebook all of my US flights. It was extremely inconvenient and AirAsia provided no leniency. I am fortunate have the finances to cover the extra charges, but it was a terrible experience to go through while on my one vacation for the year. However, online customer service options are ineffective, putting the customer first is obviously not any kind of priority (budget airline) and ability to reason outside of a cut-and-dry system is impossible."

,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok,December 2015,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"Terrible customer service. AirAsia cancelled my flight at 16 hours notice and offered a replacement on a different day. This obviously meant I had to rebook on a different airline at short notice to get a ticket on the correct day, which cost me a lot of money. Getting a refund is impossible because there is no one to speak to who will offer to help on this issue, even though it seems to be quite common. I keep getting told to send a Tweet or go to an online chat forum which simply never works."

The afternoon I was leaving London to get to KUL I received a message advising the flight had been rescheduled to a 1405 departure time! (4hrs 15mins earlier). My flight from London was due to land at 1520 so there was no way I would make it. Because of the time change, I had to call AirAsia in Indonesia and explained the situation. There was a later flight (showing available online) departing at 2020 and asked to be moved on to that. Was put on hold for a long time to be advised they would have to charge me to do that and that I should try at KUL airport to change for free. Upon arrival in KL, the later flight was full and was advised I was rebooked at 1030 the next morning. Also flew DPS-KUL-LGK - had to wait 45 mins for bags to arrive in KL and check in again. Air Asia's online system wouldn't let me do KUL-DPS-KUL-LGK-KUL as 1 booking,  so had to make separate bookings, and the handling agent in DPS couldn't thru check my luggage to LGK. DPS-KUL three passengers upgraded themselves to premium seats and the crew didn't move them back to their original seats. LGK-KUL crew didn't even leave the galley - no service at all - they blamed the turbulence, even when the Captain announced it was a smooth flight. Good value for money but awful customer service. "
,,Business,Premium Economy,CGK to KUL,November 2015,4.0,2.0,2.0,,,2.0,3,no,5,"I booked Premium Flex with AirAsia from CGK to KUL which were the best seats available on this flight and considerably more than Economy. The price includes a meal which I did not particularly want neither did the two people travelling with me. However a meal came with the flight - I was not impressed with the plastic spoon and fork to eat it with or having to pay extra for a cup of tea. Premium Flex promises Priority Check in and Boarding, at Jakarta there was priority check in but not boarding and boarding was the usual mad rush. On return flight there was no priority Check in or priority boarding. As far as I am concerned I was mis-sold these tickets. I tried AirAsia just to see what they were like as I normally use other airlines and I fly very often many thousands of miles but will never use them again."

Overall quite comfortable, clean aircraft and a good flight. The complaint if any is the fact that the lowest baggage allowance you can purchase is 20 kg, it would help if Air Asia gave a 10 kg or 15 kg option as well."

The chief stewardess is good , but I found the other FA is impolite and just want to faster complete their duty only. The seat was cramped with limited leg space for seat 23F, and it was a full flight. With a great surprise flight was lead by a female co-pilot."

Crews as always very smart and polite. Aircraft is always clean with great seat pitch. Food can be purchased onboard although for such a short sector I never bother. My only gripe on this flight was firstly the music which was played when we boarded the plane. I always like some background music when boarding as it is relaxing and also sets a pleasant and tranquil environment but this was pop music and very loud.
,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,KUL to HAN,November 2015,3.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,1.0,4,no,7,Check in agent was rude and onboard we found female FA also rude probably due to early morning flight.

They offer do wifi connection onboard this aircraft (chargeable). For the related experience we will not fly AK again.
, ,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Lombok to Kuala Lumpur,November 2015,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,Our flight was cancelled on the morning of the flight. AirAsia failed to let us know despite having our contact details. We had to contact them on an international number at great cost. When we did find out they informed us the next flight we could take was in a weeks time but they couldn't help us with accommodation. They offered us a voucher to be used within 3 months. We live in the UK and have 1 holiday a year so this was of no use. We asked them for a refund but they refused despite the fact they could not transport us in a reasonable time. We had to fly a different airline at extra cost. Staff unhelpful and couldn't care less we were stranded. I'd never use AirAsia again.

You know what you're getting and pretty much all the time thats what you receive. KLIA Terminal 2 (LCC) is a bit of a let down, it's already showing 'cracks' and it's still very new. Processing through the airport is normally fast and efficient, the shops and restaurants are excellent but once airside the skyways, travelators etc. are poor, depending on which gate you're at the walk can be ridiculously long! Food on board if great value, and if you prebook choice is also excellent, better than some main stream national carriers I've used!"
,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,DPS to SIN,November 2015,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,1.0,2,no,2,My wife and I had to fly them 3 times on a recent trip to Indonesia and wouldn't go near them again. On the first flight even though we booked together and checked in together we found we were sitting in opposite ends of the plane. On the next flight we paid more online so we could sit next to each other only to be told after waiting an hour and a half to check in that we weren't sitting next to each other and to pay another $50. I explained we had already paid for this and showed proof it fell on deaf ears and we still had to pay the extra fee. Our bag was 1.5 kg over weight so they stung us for that. On all 3 flights we could not hear a word they said over the intercom onboard the flights.

The booking experience was fine. Had already registered on their website for a domestic flight earlier. While planning my trip researched on Internet and found out they had this sale where Tickets were priced less than half of Others. Without a second thought booked two for me and my wife. While booking came to know that Checked in baggage and meals need a Surcharge. But even then two tickets cost me Rs 70000 for return with 1 checked in baggage and 4 Meals which was Super Value. I had to pay for seat selection with my wife while web checkin or if I wanted extra leg space. The flights arrived and departed on schedule, flights were clean, Flight attendants were properly dressed and spoke English.  Food served was average and I discovered I had to pay more in Indian rupees while pre-booking while it cost less in Malaysian currency inflight. Toilets were clean. AirAsia X flight from KUL to MEL was a widebody jet. There was no entertainment system. Seats were tight for me (6 feet) but my wife (5/6) was alright. Had 7 and 5 hours lay over at KLIA terminal 2 at Kuala Lumpur which is fine for Shopping  and Eating and even has a low cost Samasama hotel where we rested for few hours. Overall I got what I paid for. I recommend planning and booking in advance to book in their frequent sales and making most of it."

The staff at check in did all they could to get me to the gate but I was way too late. The services counter staff were very helpful and I got a replacement ticket for the next day, it cost more of course but the staff were very friendly and offered a number of options, not just the next flight, they also offered advice on accommodation options to returning to Kuala Lumpur for the night which would have worked out cheaper for me had I taken them up on the offer. AirAsia offer a far superior service than some other low cost airlines such as Jetstar.  (» World's Best Low-Cost Airline)"

This happens every time I go with AirAsia. What annoyed me was we were told the flight was on-time but only at boarding time were we told the flight would be an hour late. However it seemed to be more like 2 hours.  If you want to do certain routes like Surabaya to Kuala Lumpur there are no feasible alternatives to AirAsia.

I don't normally use Low cost airlines however for short trips I find them fine. Web check in for both flights quick and easy I had no baggage so straight through security and immigration. Boarding done by row and I had seat 1A, flight left on time and arrived spot on time. Flight time of 45 min, seat comfortable and was given a water by the young nice crew. Return once again checked in on the web so straight through the efficient Changi immigration and security to gate D37. Boarding fairly orderly although done by row number and again 1A. Flight departed on time but due to poor weather took a little longer, around 1hr 10min. The crew were unable to serve anything due to the turbulence but otherwise flight was fine. If using this airline, pay a little more for a hot seat, it's worth the few ££. This return trip cost me almost 100% less than the others on this route."

Nice clean aircraft, excellent crew, on time and comfortable seats. The pre ordered hot meals are not the best, and often not a lot of western choice, but its ok for a short trip. I honestly don't know how some of the airlines get any economy passengers if Air Asia is on the same route."

Going to Kalibo, the flight was delayed by almost 3 hrs and we were compensated with a banana chocolate loaf and water. Going back to Manila was worse. They moved my flight to 4 hours earlier and if that wasn't annoying enough they actually delayed it on the day. I left Kalibo at 3.20, close to my original flight time but instead of doing my planned activities I had to wait in a crowded airport frustrated. This time no compensation. "

The flight was very smooth, nice take off, cruising and landing. Cabin staff service was also surprisingly good. Staff smiled and were friendly and helpful. However, the flight was delayed about 30 minutes on arrival, and the seat pitch was awful, far too - hope this will change in the future. Overall, despite the delay and seat pitch, it was a good experience, cheap price but good quality flight. "
,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MNL to DVO,August 2015,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,2,no,2,I flew them on Aug 5 in the evening. The flight was supposed to be at 8pm but it was delayed to 9.45pm without any explanation. Finally we boarded around 10pm and we left 30 minutes later. The only compensation was a tiny piece of banana and chocolate cake and a small bottle of water. The flight was quiet but the seat is very small. Other problem: everybody was sleeping on the flight but they kept the lights on full during the 1.5 hour flight. 
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Gold Coast via Kuala Lumpur,August 2015,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,2,no,1,"This review is for the return trip from Bangkok to Gold Coast via KL. On the way over we flew an overnight flight. It was the coldest flight I have been on. Even with boots, jumper, scarf and our own blanket we were cold. When we arrived at the Gold Coast, the outside air temperature was 16 degrees - that felt warm. Moreover the lights were left on until very late (approx. 2.5 hrs after take off) and turned on very early (approx. 3 hrs before landing). We had very little time for sleeping. In conclusion, it was the most uncomfortable flight we have traveled on. On the return trip, we were notified via email around 3.40 am that the flight was about 3 hour delayed, however we left home at 5am and had not checked our email so we were not aware of the delay. When we arrived at the airport we tried to ask staff to issue us a Boarding pass for the next available connecting flight to Bangkok from KL as we knew we would miss our originally booked flight. However we were told they could not do that but she assured us that Air Asia staff in KL would be able to get us a flight to Bangkok that evening. When we arrived at KL we (and other passengers who missed their connecting flights) were made to wait at the transit desk for around 40 mins before we were notified that all of us had to stay overnight in KL and fly the next day. In the end we gave up realising that nothing could be done, we had no other choice but to fly the following morning. It was about 3 hours before we could leave the airport with other passengers."

,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur,June 2015,1.0,4.0,,,,4.0,3,no,3,"I flew to Kuala Lumpur and back and hated both flights. I'm 6 foot tall, and I usually go in a window seat and I am fine. I was on the aisle seat for both flights and found my legs crammed in. My seat wouldn't recline and found it impossible to find a comfortable position. The plane was too cold, I shivered on the plane and can only be grateful I wasn't allocated a middle or window seat. If you are over 6 feet, 183cm tall, don't expect a pleasant experience. Only good thing was the staff were absolutely fine."
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Hong Kong to Xi'an via KL, Jakarta, Singapore, Bangkok",June 2015,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"June 2015 I went on a small trip around Asia and I had 5 flights with AirAsia: HK-KL, KL-Jakarta, Jakarta-Singapore, Singapore-Bangkok, Bangkok-Xi'an. Beforehand, I read some reviews about AirAsia online and 99% of them were really bad. Everyone was complaining about delayed/changed flights and poor customer service. After all I read, I expected awful flights but in fact everything went smoothly. All flights were on time (except one - 2 hours delay) and customer service was good. And yes, you have to pay for drinks and food on board but come on, I got 5 flights around Asia for less than £200 altogether. I would fly with AirAsia again!"
,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Denpasar,June 2015,3.0,4.0,,,,4.0,5,yes,8,"This was our first AirAsia trip from Perth to Bali. We're spoilt for choice in Perth with multiple flights daily by AirAsia, Garuda, Jetsar and Virgin. We used to fly Jetstar because as a Qantas Club member we could use the QF lounge in Perth - that doesn't open just for Jetstar flights, so you have to jag it when there's a Qantas international flight going out - not that there's many of those these days. So this time we decided to give Air Asia a go because their fares were excellent. Spot on time departure ex Perth, clean aircraft and we paid extra for Row 1. Pleasant enough flight for a LCC. We paid extra for the Red Carpet service on the return journey, and this was an absolute treat. No queues, someone to escort you through immigration, and access to the Premier Lounge which is on a par with the QF Business lounges in Perth. Also you get to board first, so minimal queuing - for frequent travellers to Bali this is worth paying for. The usual customer types on board making it mildly embarrassing for the FA's but they'd be used to it on that run. It was an on time departure, and this time a little IFE with one of the cabin crew playing his guitar and singing over the cabin PA to well deserved applause from the punters. AirAsia is cheap as chips and very efficient - what's not to like on this easy 3.5  hour run between Perth and Bali. "
,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,CGK to DPS,June 2015,4.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,8,Flew AirAsia from Jakarta to Bali and overall it was a pleasant flight. I've enjoy reading their magazines as a replacement to the IFE - which is understandable as it is a low cost carrier. The flight attendants were nice and the landing was pretty smooth.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Air Asia India: Traveled from Delhi to Bangalore on May 23rd. One of the worst experiences I have had. We boarded the flight which was scheduled to depart at 5.25 pm but due to some technical reasons they returned from the runway and had to change the plane at the last moment. As a result the flight got delayed by almost 3 hours. Next surprise was that they did not offer complementary food considering everybody was just sitting in the plane for 3 hours. When some of us asked the reply was that they are not carrying sufficient food for everyone. The crew was inexperienced. They had no idea about how to handle the situation. I think Air Asia should focus on the quality of services before expanding their network.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew Bangkok to Bali then Bali to Singapore. Planes were clean and new and seats were comfortable but small. I paid extra to book the first row and there was plenty of legroom. The first five rows are reserved for anyone who buys the premium seats (I think it cost about 10 bucks) and they were mostly empty on both flights so I was able to lay down and sleep across the second row. I pre-booked a meal for a few dollars and it was pretty good. Only complaint is they bus you to the plane from the terminal so boarding is a bit hectic. Overall great experience for a budget airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,yes,8,Round-trip from Goa to Bangalore on 29 April 2015. Later when I heard many bad reviews about Air Asia I was worried. But when I travelled all flights were on time. Crew were polite. Service was good.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,5,yes,7,TRZ-KUL-DPS-JOG and CGK-KUL-MAA. Travelled in the month of November 2014. Booked the tickets few months in advance good deal. All are A320 aircraft's neat and clean. Both ground staff and crew are good in service. Departed / Landed on time. Hope to travel again. Strongly recommend others for travelling in Air Asia.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Flew recently from Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur. Flight was delayed 2 hours. Notification when I was already on my way to the airport. Also cheap is something else with all the add ons you end up paying double to the advertised price. Had better experiences with Lionair / Tigerair for flights in Asia. No space in the aircraft and a small water costs 3$.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,2,no,1,My flight was from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur on 30 March 2015 at 11.55am. At about 10.30am we were told the flight would leave 2.5 hours late. (We didn't board until after 3pm). Many of us would miss connecting flights I was told that I would be informed about my new connection in Kuala Lumpur. We arrived just after 9pm we handed our boarding passes and were told to wait. After an hour we were given boarding passes for our next flights and were told we had to collect our baggage to go to a hotel. We waited for an hour with our luggage then went through immigration and customs and left the airport to wait for a bus to our hotel. After midnight some of us started to realise that the promised hotel rooms were non-existent and went inside to be in the air conditioning. (We hadn't had food or water served for about five hours by this time.) One staff member yelled at people who were reluctant to leave again to wait for the hotel bus and security were called when one passenger started to complain loudly. A group of passengers were taken to a hotel and returned to our group outside the airport after an hour because they couldn't get them rooms. AirAsia staff then left us. I for example waited 12 hours outside the airport with all my luggage; I had no Malaysian currency to buy food because I was only in transit. No one offered me a food or drink voucher and not one AirAsia staff member apologised. Apparently this level of service is acceptable. I would never book with them again as it's a false economy: you might save a few dollars upfront but if something goes wrong AirAsia takes no corporate responsibility and you are on your own.
,,,,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,5,yes,9,Using AirAsia 2 at least twice per month for the last 3 or so years. Majority of the flights were departing on time and many touch down even a few minutes before scheduled arrival With the new KLIA2 facilities AirAsia flights from/to Kuala Lumpur are now so much more enjoyable than before with the carrier operating out of LCCT.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,,,3,no,7,"I have flown many flights with Air Asia and Air AsiaX over the past few years. I generally found them to be a value airline but my opinion is changing. I flew from HoChiMinhCity to Kuala Lumpur return. As with most discount airlines the ""all in price"" listed in the booking is hard to find. First of all you have to wade through the various ad-ons for baggage insurance etc deducting them as you go or you end up with an inflated fare. But to my surprise as I hadn't experienced this gouge before the booking imposed a $12 fee for using my credit card. As well the onboard duty free sales do not take credit cards only Malaysian currency and US dollars despite stating that all major currencies were accepted. My seat-mate on the inbound flight had to convince staff to accept Euros. All in all after all costs were added up the flight was only marginally cheaper than Vietnam Airlines and far less hassle with a full service carrier. Air Asia advertises low-cost but their fares have risen dramatically in the past few years. I don't think the average customer wants to have to spend time and energy having to find the ""all in price"" deducting the various ad-ons only to be stung at the end with the credit card charge. By then you are so fed up with the search for the initial fare that you just agree to pay the ""fine"" for using your credit card. In my caes it amounted to a surcharge of about 15%. The credit card companies charge their customers 3%. Flying discount airlines can be the only reasonable cost way to fly to some destinations. But always compare ""all in"" is an advertising pitch leaving you to find it."
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,,,5,yes,9,Perth to Denpasar (Bali) on A320. Everything about it was as you expect. Chosen for the exceptional price at the best times of day. Flights left on time/arrived early. Brand new aircraft. Only thing off-putting were the 'threats' about drinking alcohol on the flights and having future bookings cancelled as a consequence but I guess on a route like this they regularly get trouble.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,,,5,yes,10,AirAsia Philippines: MNL-KBO-MNL. This budget airline surprised me in almost every aspect I can think of. Ground and Cabin Crew were friendly both outbound and inbound flight were on time price was reasonable. Although its unfortunate that they are still stationed at the old manila domestic airport I can say that it doesn't mean the other local airlines using the new airport terminal are better. I can even say that my experience with Air Asia was way more pleasant compared to the others.
,,,,,,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,,,5,yes,10,In January we travelled on four flights in Cambodia-Thailand-Vietnam. Everything about the flights was completely satisfactory and simply no fault could be found. I have no hesitation in recommending them. It's a pity such airlines based in the UK / Europe do not seem to operate at this level. Food and inflight entertainment not used. Only included as one star as the system demands it must be answered.
,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,2,Fly drive Mukdahan - KOP - DMK. Poor service at check in. Bag overweight so had to pay extra. No problem. Went to service desk to pay. Lady started to serve my wife and then dealt with someone at the next window already being served and ignored us. Flight cramped compared to Nok Air. Drive was fine and on time from Mukdahan. Plane to DMK a little late.
,,,,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,4,yes,8,Travelled first time on Air Asia between Sydney-KL-Penang and Sydney-KL in Business Class. Got a cheap deal as I booked months ahead. Both trips were very pleasant and the female air crew were very pleasant and efficient. Not too sure about the male crew as I only saw them sitting down or eating as their female colleagues worked. The Business Class seats were very comfortable and a pillow and duvet was provided. Food was warm and served at the time you requested. Ground crew in KL kept customers waiting for more than 20 mins as they served 1 customer with issues. Common sense would dictate that this customer be served separately and kept the line moving. Staff were very strict with luggage allowance as I saw many people re-packing at the counters. A good trip and I would fly Air Asia again.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,9,CNX-MFM. Kiosk check-in with no bags. Took all of 10 seconds. Flight landed on-time in Macau. Flight left on-time but waited on the tarmac for 20 minutes before take-off with no explanation as to why. Cabin staff friendly and helpful. Would happily fly them again especially ex-CNX!
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Recently flew from Sydney to KL on Air Asia the flight was pleasant and the staff were friendly. This airline is great value for money and perfect for getting you from point A to B for a fraction of the cost. Inflight entertainment and food is optional yet not necessary. I would recommend upgrading to the quiet zone for a few extra dollars. A number of us also travelled with bikes and other excess luggage the airline was great in taking care of this and we travelled without an issue. I would defiantly recommend and will be returning to Malaysia with them in the future.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,10/1/15-17/1/15. QZ547 and QZ 544. My husband and I travelled on Air Asia Perth to Denpasar return last week and the flights were fine. The Perth to Denpasar flight left 30 minutes early and as it wasn't a full flight my husband was able to stretch out and have a sleep. The Denpasar to Perth flight was full but once again there were no issues. The flight attendants did their jobs competently. I would definitely recommend Air Asia for short trips.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew the KUL-CGK on 20 December and CGK-KUL on 4th January. On the sector KUL-CGK the food that I pre-booked was delicious served hot nice and creamy. On the sector CGK-KUL food was served hot and it was awesome. Overall good trip satisfaction. FA's were nice and presented a good service throughout the flight. Will continue to fly AirAsia.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,As I write this my wife is trying to get home from Bali. They promoted their new direct flight from Melbourne to Bali late last year which we booked only to be told two days before departure that they never had authorisation for that route. As a result she had to travel through KL and this added an extra 8 hours to her trip. They promised that the issue of the direct flight would be fixed before her return trip and guess what. Another text two days before she returns home saying that she is going through KL again. Then the morning of coming home the Flight to KL was cancelled and she was put on an earlier flight meaning she had to leave her hotel in a mad rush at 4am to get to the airport. In total it will now take her 16 hours to get from Bali to Melbourne with this joke of a so called airline. Add to that the customer service is poor the planes are dirty and they promise things they have no intention of delivering. Never again.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,2,yes,5,Kuching to Penang. Flight was scheduled at 7.55pm but was delayed to 8.30pm most likely due to bad weather. Boarding was fast seat was extremely narrow and I was rather shocked about it as only recently I flew with MAS. Flight was very bumpy but this is most probably due to weather. Food was rather tasteless and is not worth the price. The ticket price wasn't very cheap either only about RM20 cheaper than MAS. I would have opted for MAS if MAS has direct flight between these two cities.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,KUL-HKT-KUL. I accept that if you don't pay to choose a seat it will be selected randomly. But to split people up on the same booking (my wife was in the row behind me) is ridiculous. Outward flight 15 minutes late (it appeared that someone's bag was being offloaded so maybe someone failed to board the flight) before arriving into the chaos of Phuket airport arrivals (I reviewed this airport separately).
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew Air Asia in July from Bengaluru to Chennai 4 times onward and return as well. The fares were excellent and the planes neat and clean. The price is the Company's UPS which is helping them do well in Malaysia Indonesia and other Asian countries where they fly. The only thing which I did not like was issuing Paper Boarding passes instead of the regular passes. But I heard they have changed this and are now issuing the normal passes. Would surely fly again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,7,Just flew four sectors with AirAsia and couldn't fault except for limited menu options at the end of the flight from Sydney to KL. Only complaint would be about their partner optiontown. I paid for an upgrade and booking fee for 2 via their website about 2 months prior to our flight. About 4 hours before the flight I received an email saying our flight upgrade was unsuccessful. We got on the plane to an announcement that there were upgrades available to business class for almost double what we originally paid - 4 in fact. We feel ripped off. I do not accept their were 4 business class cancellations. Either Air Asia or their partner Optiontown are guilty of charging our booking fee for no service.
,,,,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,no,2,Flew with them this week between Bangalore Chandigarh and back to Bangalore. I feel the airline has potential if handled properly. The ground staff leave a lot to be desired. Our flight from Bangalore although boarded on time the crew could not clear for quite a while. Pilot seemed to take each thing at a time effecting delay. The return leg was further confusion as fog delayed the incoming flight but no one was interested to let the passengers know the same. No announcements. Also in the aircraft the crew just forgot to ask all to switch off the phones. If it is not much of a problem then why push for it all other times. Where is the safety when the announcements were not completed. No smoking announcement not made. Some positives though. Good pricing strategy. Fresh aircraft and good potential if staff improve.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,5,yes,10,Took the KUL-CGK-KUL on AK386 and QZ202 respectively. Cabin crew were awesome and very good. Food was ok but could add more menus and add more spices to the food.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,3,I needed to get to Bangkok Chiang Mai and Krabi. To do this within my allotted time span I had no alternative but to fly between these cities. The price differential is quite marked so I elected to try Air Asia which would allow me to compare it with Bangkok Airways who I had flown with before. The aircraft was configured as a single cabin. The first few rows sported cotton covers over the seat headrest and were reserved for passengers willing to pay a premium. The other seats were so close together that for any person over five feet six inches (like myself) were forced into a painful contortion to avoid digging their knees into the seat-back in front. Minutes after the aircraft departed the four cabin crew members wasted no time in blocking the aisles with trolleys flogging drinks and snacks followed quickly by the same four trying their best to get passengers to buy mementoes of Air Asia. My next flight (Chiang Mai to Krabi) due to depart at 12 noon was cancelled. Its replacement was rescheduled to depart at 5.30pm. This meant a totally wasted day for me and meant arriving at my pre-booked hotel at 9pm instead of 3pm. No apologies – no explanations from Air Asia. The only consistency being the aircraft seating configurations and 2 hours of discomfort instead of one. More of the same on my last flight so there is little point in relating it. All in all my experiences were certainly negative ones.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,,,4,yes,8,Bangkok DMK to Siem Reap Cambodia on 24 November. First time on Air Asia. A320 arrived late but plane was turned around quicker than normal. Gate agents never said anything about the delay which I hate - just say the flight is late. We departed 20 minutes late and arrived in Siem Reap about 10 minutes late. Short 50 minute flight. Plenty of leg room (I'm 175 cm) and had a seat in the middle open so plenty of room. Flight attendants very friendly. Didn't eat or drink but snacks looked reasonably priced. Luggage was off quickly - immigration took forever but that isn't Air Asia's fault. Very nice airline and flew a couple days later again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,4,yes,8,"Siem Reap Cambodia - KUL on 27 November. Check in was quick - my bag was over the 20 kg limit so they let me re- pack and carry on a 2nd carry-on the signs all over say ""only 1 carry-on allowed"" but I never saw anyone say anything to customers with multiple carry-on bags. Agents were friendly both on the ground and in the air. Inbound flight was late an hour so departure was delayed the same time ground staff announced the delay just at the time we would have been departing. Think its a standard of Air Asia to not announce delays promptly. Flight was good - 2 hours and again a seat in the middle free. Bought noodles and snacks - good value for money and delicious. Landed at KUL Terminal 2 about 45 minutes late and bags came out fairly quickly. Enjoyed the flight and definitely a good fare."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,November 26th Chiang Mai to Hong Kong. Early morning flight (departure time 06.00) and while the standard check- in for international flights is 3 hours prior to departure time the counter failed to be staffed until 04.20. A small irritant yes but it was a harbinger of things to come. Ticketing and luggage handling pretty typical of any other airlines with the exception of dealing with excess baggage. Each bag is weighed and there is no leeway whatsoever. Every increment of one kilo was billed as excess baggage. They do not make this easy. The passenger must leave the queue walk across the terminal to the Air Asia cashier process the necessary transaction and then return to the ticket agent to complete the process. We knew we had excess weight we had pre-purchased an additional 20 kilos of sporting equipment. The agent unilaterally decided that trekking equipment was not sporting equipment therefore it was to be classified as excess baggage. We were forced to pay an additional 5575 baht (approximately 175.00 USD) simply based on his arbitrary determination. We pre-ordered and prepaid for an inflight meal. Their idea of a breakfast meal is a small tin of rice or noodles and a 4 oz. cup of water. It was the worst attempt at a meal I have ever witnessed. On this trip we used 10 different airlines. Did Air Asia get us to Hong Kong on time? Yes. Was the plane clean? Yes. Did we receive value for the money spent? Not even close. Of all the airline companies we flew was AirAsia at least average? Not even close! Would we ever fly this company again knowing now how they treat their customers? I hope we never are faced with that decision.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,yes,9,We were a group of five who took CGK - DMK - CGK flight (QZ 252 and QZ 255) both stints were pretty much on time efficient check in process at both airports. As expected we were seated at distant rows which was alright for us. Overall very satisfactory.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,5,yes,9,AK384 KUL-CGK / BDO-KUL. Both flight departed on time and arrived a few minutes earlier than scheduled. Cabin crew for KUL-CGK - seemed friendlier and approachable. Luggage drop were fast as I did web check in.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,5,yes,9,My family and I (group of 5) flew PNH-KLIA2-PNH in November 2014. The PNH-KLIA2 flight was almost full and the KLIA2-PNH flight was completely full. Having been a regular AA and AAX flyer since 2006 we knew what to expect - value for money. Our expectations were kept at a reasonable level and once again we were not disappointed. Cabin service was good. I have found AA and AAX cabin staff to be at least as good as those of full-service airlines but some of the ground staff at the old LCCT and on the Gold Coast have been abrupt if now downright rude. A few ground staff at the old LCCT had a poor command of English. On balance though in my 8 years of flying on AA and AAX I have found AA and AAX to be good to excellent.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,yes,7,"12th Nov 2014. Flight: AK139 Hong Kong (1050 dep) to Kuala Lumpur (KLIA2). This is the third airline review I am adding - the previous two I have literally just submitted using a 'minus points plus points' format. I'm not sure that I can think of any minus points for this flight. There was nothing amazing about it but it ticked the boxes that this low-cost airline pledged to tick. I have scored 3/5 for ""Food and Beverages"" because I am required to score but I did not have any as I chose to bring my own on-board. However what the airline offers is more substantial and far better-priced and I would pre-book meals with them in future. As for ""Inflight Entertainment"" that is non-existent as would be expected."
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,I frequently fly Air Asia and like the cleanliness and modern aircraft. This flight was Perth to Kuala Lumpur. The seat business class seating is okay and almost lie flat enabling a couple of hours sleep on the flight. The airline policy for quiet areas at the front on the plane is very good.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,We flew from KLIA2 to Bangkok Don Muang return at the end of October. I bought the tickets during a promo sale so paid very little. All went well. Flights were on time. It was a holiday weekend on the way out so the flight was full. Coming back things were less hectic as it was a normal weekday. I chose a lunch time flight so we could use a taxi to the airport easily. Check in was quick and the flight went on time. The pre-booked meals were all as expected. Seats were free up the back and we were allowed to use them and spread out. Arrival at KLIA2 was easy as we'd used the airport before. Air Asia offers a great product. You know what you'll get and so long as you buy during a promo period you'll pay very little.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,10,Business class to and from Australia was well up to expectations. Flights on time comfortable seating clean and modern aircraft edible food polite helpful and welcoming crew. Likewise the 3 internal Malaysian flights in a single-class aircraft.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,,,5,yes,10,Business class was wonderful except for the meals and any drinks had to be brought including water. The inflight entertainment was limited and if you didn't book it with your flight you could not request it once you got to the plane as they only allow enough for the pre booked entertainment. The seating and value for money was wonderful and the 8 hour flight went very quickly. I would recommend that you eat well before going on the flight and you will be very happy with everything else.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,7,"Comfortable business class ""flatbeds"" on longer legs of trip - service good - usually depart and arrive on time. Staff usually very friendly and accommodating but this last trip (Sydney/KUL/CNX) staff were a bit on the reserved side. This is unusual even with the short flights I have taken with Air Asia as well as some other business class flights. My rating for inflight entertainment was 3 out of 5 because one needs to purchase the entertainment separately and I did not use it as I was travelling overnight. Generally and for the most part I would recommend flying Air Asia."
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,5 October 2014 FD315 and D7 222. I had already booked a flight from BKK to SYD on another airline but had to cancel and find another flight closer to my departure date. AirAsia had a business class ticket available departing from Don Mueang at an excellent price so I bought it. The first flight from DMK to KUL didn't have a designated business class seating section but my seat was in the 3rd row so that was convenient. The flight from KUL to SYD did have a separate business class seating area with chairs that reclined almost flat for sleeping. The chair width was ample. Although a 180 degree flatbed would have been better AirAsia's was decent and I was able to sleep fairly well. The service was excellent and we were given extra snack treats. I will definitely fly AirAsia business class for an overnight flight again as long as it is affordable for me.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,My wife and I flew from Sydney to Kuala Lumpar and then on to Phuket with Air Asia in business class albeit the KL to Phuket sector did not have any business class - which we had been warned about prior to the trip so this was no surprise. We were very pleasantly surprised at the amount of space and the ability to turn the seat into an almost flat bed albeit the incline was just enough to make sliding down the seat a bit of a problem. The service was excellent and whilst the food was quite basic and they had not got our pre ordered meals correct the food was adequate. The inflight entertainment was also quite basic but as we had been warned of this we had our own tablets etc so we certainly did not suffer. As far as value for money goes I could not have wished for a better experience. We will certainly use this airline again where possible.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,,5,yes,9,Over the past month I have flown Domestically several times in Thailand and last week flew Business Class to Australia. I will return to Thailand the same way. I am an Australian but have lived in Asia for the past 22 years. Air Asia has grown and improved remarkably over the past few month. The crew service food cleanliness of the planes are all now far superior than in the past. It is a low cost carrier but now it doesn't feel so much that way.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,20th Apr 2014 Perth-Kuala Lumpur flight D7233. 18th Oct 2014 Kuala Lumpur-Perth flight D232 in Business Class. Cabin consists of 12 seats only so is nice and quiet. Seats are cocoon style. backs do not recline but the seat does all the work thus you never have anyone in front reclining their seat in your face. Nice big pillows and doonas complete the feeling of luxury. Meals are not a highlight however. We find comfort far more important than meals. One good thing about the meal service however is you can tell the cabin crew when you would like to eat. If you want a comfortable few hours sleep where you can stretch full length and cuddle up in a doona can thoroughly recommend Air Asia Business Class. Aircraft clean and crew very helpful.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,5,yes,10,D7206 24 October 2014. This was our first Business Class flight experience with Air Asia and it exceeded all our expectations. Because it is a No Frills Airline we were not expecting a full service. We made our meal selection at the time of booking. We were given a glass of orange juice on arrival and the meals we had selected were delivered soon after take-off. These are normal economy fare but at the fare we paid we did not expect any different. Alcohol was available for payment. The seats however are as good as you would hope to find in any full service business class. Fully lie flat and with the full size pillow and duvet supplied we enjoyed a good sleep for almost the entire flight. Would I chose this again? Absolutely!
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,5,yes,7,AK827 on 23/9 from Phuket to KL then KL to Sydney on 23/9 Flight D722. Return was on D223 Sydney to KL on 7/10 then same date KL to Phuket on AK222. I booked well in advance for a trip to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur and am a frequent flyer with Aisr Asia so am aware of the restrictions for the excellent price and service which is provided. I would have liked to have been informed that there was no Business Class Lounge at Kuala Lumpur airport and also it would have helped if they had given us some idea of the great distance between Gates. I cannot fault their service at the desks through the Gates and on the aircraft. Business Class is extremely comfortable and with the exception of the food and beverage arrangement which I was aware of very good.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,We flew PEN-DMK by FD402. The flight departed and arrived on time. Boarding in Penang smooth and efficient as was the arrival in Bangkok. The cabins are fresh and clean. Crew is efficient and accommodating. So when the fares are reasonable I see no reason not to give AirAsia top marks. It helps that DMK although it looks a bit outdated is more efficient than BKK by far. On a sidenote the question on inflight entertainment is not relevant on a 2 hours flight but the inflight magazine is good so high score here.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,AirAsia Philippines is the worst airline I have ever flown with we were flying from Cebu to Manila and back. The boarding process was a disaster with everybody wanting to go in at the same time and nobody tried to even control the flow of passengers. At check in they managed to put our daughter 8 years old in a different row than the parents. On the way back they managed to put our 2 children (5 and 8 years old) in row 6 and the parents in row 26. For a fee they could change seats - this is not normal in my eyes and it would have been normal to put us all in one row. The person who checked us in acted as if he was tired and doing all he could.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,Travelled KCH-KUL with AirAsia and KUL-ICN with AirAsiaX (Fly-thru). Happy with their efficient and no-nonsense service. Baggage went all the way from KCH to ICN. Flight departed on time (as with most other flights I have taken with AirAsia). In-flight magazine was quite an interesting and informative read. Pleased with the courtesy of the crew. Also the Captain greeted disembarking passengers which is excellent.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,"We flew from Denpasar to Perth yesterday and will never fly this airline again. We checked in several hours before our flight and were disappointed to find that we had been given seats in two different rows (my husband and I were flying with our two kids). Obviously we had hoped to sit together as a family but thought ""oh well it's not the end of the world"". We boarded the plane and realised that we were not only in different rows but in 4 different seats. We were absolutely gob-smacked that an airline could put a 2 year old on his own! When we waved down the air hostess and explained that our son who had just turned two could not sit on his own she told us that the flight was full and we would have to take our dedicated seats. I told her that our 2 year old could not possibly sit on his own and she suggested that he sit on my lap instead. Pretty disappointing when you paid for 4 seats. Just when I thought things couldn't get much worse the food trolley came around and after placing my order for a hot meal for myself and my two kids I was told that they only accept cash and not card. I didn't have any cash on me (I had actually tried to withdraw cash at the airport but the ATM was out of order) so they told me I was unable to order any food. I said that there must be some other option as my kids were hungry and surely there was something they could do but they did not help at all. My poor kids basically spent the whole flight crying with hunger and they wouldn't even give me a bottle of water (as our water had been taken off us at the airport by security). I was basically in tears by this time and finally a kind passenger gave me $10 so I could buy something for the kids to eat. I will never fly with this airline again."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,no,5,Out of the 9 Air Asia flights I took in May and June 2014 5 of those flights were late by more than 40 mins. Another bug I have with Air Asia is that they do not notify passengers of flight changes dates etc. They simply change itineraries and let passengers find out themselves. I have flown with them for 7 years and I'm losing patience at the way they do not care for passengers who support them. They are not cheap anymore. Scoot are far more reliable and a similar price ex Sydney. Once my pre-booked flights for 2015 are used it's bye bye to Air Asia for me. Too little too late! 50% good is not good enough!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,Our very first experience with AirAsia and we are totally pleased. Our family of 8 flew from Johor Bahru - KL so a quick flight. Check-in was smooth however we arrived early and it was quite sometime before the check-in counter opened. The waiting area at Johor Bahru is just adequate. However the flight itself was smooth and efficient getting us to KL on time. As it was such a quick flight there was no time for inflight entertainment or food & beverages. I would highly recommend AirAsia. Value for money was excellent.
,,,,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5,yes,10,Having flown many times with AirAsia we are really amused by some of the critical comments about this airline. Having flown dozens of times in SE Asia and might we add that we always fly Business Class for our long haul with another airline we find Air Asia short flights excellent. If you choose to fly long haul on a budget airline don't expect first class service. Air Asia does what it says on the tin. They are punctual good value food wed upgrade our luggage and seat when you book and crew are always pleasant. Petty comments about no entertainment on a 1 or 2 hour flight takes some beating. As with Ryanair follow their rules and you will have no problems.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Delayed for almost 20 hours without food water and accommodation in Kansai airport. It was a midnight flight. No announcements to update status until 3 hours after departure time. Handled the exit and collection of luggage in a messy manner. Worst airline that io have ever taken. Unprofessional and doesn't care about passengers. Only having profit in mind. Didn't even care for passenger carrying sleeping child. They have to queue in a messy manner to collect departure card from AirAsia ground crew.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,,,4,no,2,Unpleasant Experience - flying with toddler with Air Asia. I flew with my wife and 4-year-old son from Jakarta to Singapore on 12 Sep 2014. Surprisingly three of us were assigned to three different seats in three different rows. I asked the check-in counter officer to change the seats. However he said that the flight was full and suggested I purchase seats in advance on my next flights. Some thoughts on this incident: 1) Is this Air Asia business model? Separating a toddler from his/her parents could PUSH the parents to purchase seats on the next flight. This is shown as an ads on AirAsia magazine. 2) Is safety Air Asia's concern? Separating a toddler from his/her parents raises a safety risk. Suppose an emergency event occurs. Who will help the toddler? Do you think a stranger sitting next to him/her would help him/her? Finally I exchanged seats with other passengers. This definitely causes unpleasant for them. After this incident I do not recommend a family with young children to fly with Air Asia unless they want to purchase seats.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,5,yes,10,Having returned from a 3 week trip around SE Asia flying 6 legs with Air Asia I have to recommend their service aircraft ground staff cabin crew and pricing. We had the pleasure of flying Air Asia out of KL and Thai Air Asia out of Bangkok HCMC and Phisanulok. On all occasions check in was quick and efficient with clear direction given boarding spoken in English seat allocation and comfort fine with ample space for the short haul flights FA's were well presented with good command of English flights all left on time food and beverage acceptable with good pricing compared to other budget airlines no IFE but most people talked to their partner the old fashion way of communication which made the flight seem short. Overall my wife and myself were very pleased we chose Air Asia to travel around SE Asia and would have no hesitation in booking to fly with them again.
,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,,,4,yes,6,Praya/Lombok to Kuala Lumpur (KLIA2) as a HiFlyer. I booked the Premium Flex fare to enjoy the extras such as 20kg checked baggage and priority seating. Online booking is straightforward if a bit annoying due to the many forced opt-out options one has to explicitly decline. Web check-in however started to be positively jarring: mobile boarding pass didn't work with a European cell number the airport kiosk can't reprint an already issued boarding pass and the whole experience gets very frustrating very soon. Ground staff were helpful but this is too little to overcome the system's shortcomings. Priority boarding is a myth at LOP as there is only a single security line at the gate which opened extremely late. That way everyone finds themselves standing in a long line with no seating while hundreds of empty seats wait inside the gate area. I ended up boarding among the last just to fight for some overhead bin space and reclaim my assigned seat. FAs didn't really seem very engaged and it took some doing to get their attention just to purchase a drink onboard. The flight was okay but the general feel is of a barebone service.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,AK759 Penang to Singapore 3 Sep. Check-in for this flight was very good barely queued for 3 or so minutes before the airline's agents checked us in. Boarding for this flight was not as organised as I would have preferred. Firstly the airport mixed up the gates so there were a lot of confused passengers rushing to the correct gate. Secondly the gate agents did not issue PA announcements so many passengers quickly rushed to the front of the gate counter in the hope that they'll get to board first which shouldn't be the case for an airline that charges for priority boarding. Boarding was slightly delayed due to preparation of aircraft but the airline made up for the delay by boarding passengers through the front and rear exits. The flight departed Penang just a few minutes late once airborne the crew came around quickly to distribute immigration cards and take orders for drinks/deliver pre-booked meals. Aircraft was a bit worn and tired - my seat pocket was ripped on the left side and passenger in front of me seemed to have trouble reclining. Nevertheless seat was quite comfortable. Arrival in Singapore 10 minutes ahead of schedule and disembarked within 10 minutes of landing. AirAsia is ok for the price will consider using them again for flights to and from Malaysia.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Boarding was delayed 2 hours because of the incoming flight. This was ok we received vouchers. We boarded the airplane and just after the safety instructions we where informed that there was a problem with an engine. So we waited a further hour when we were informed that we had to disembark. So about 300 passengers left the airport received a coupon and started to queue at the 1 shop to get some food. After an hour of queuing the shop stopped serving claiming that they had run out of food and that we had to go to the other side of security zone to get some food. So we where directed to another queue which turned out to lead to a security check which took away all the fluids that we had bought and returned us exactly where we had started. We queued again to the shop. After an hour the police came and said we had to vacate the area. In both cases an Air Asia representative should have taken the trouble to inform us of what was going on. So then we had a further 3 queues each taking more than an our to pass passport control get hotel vouchers and board busses. Air Asia obviously does not care about our holiday time because if they had they would have canceled the flight earlier so that at least the passengers could spend an afternoon outside of the airport. Air Asia is fine when everything goes well. But when there is a problem they will rip the passengers off.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,I flew from Kuala Lumpur to Sydney. The flight was cancelled after we had boarded. We had to queue for hours for various things. Air Asia did the bare minimum to help.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew Sydney-Kuala Lumpur-Bangkok on July 28 2014. The flight was on a budget fare but was on-time at all stops. Food on board had to purchased but quite reasonable. Customs clearance at Bangkok Don Mueang was also efficient. On the return journey in August my wallet was stolen at Don Mueang and Airasia held the plane for 20 minutes while their staff assisted with a search. As my wallet was not located I was without cash when I arrived at Kuala Lumpur. I was very impressed when one of their staff gave me 20 ringgits so I could purchase a meal. Most impressive.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew from MNL-Cebu. One hour flight without problems in a new plane and plenty of legroom.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew Air Asia India from Bangalore to Chennai. Check-in smooth and efficient. Boarding completed before time and pushback 10 minutes ahead of schedule. New and clean aircraft manned by an efficient cockpit and cabin crew. Landed in Chennai 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Looking forward to them expanding to more destinations within India.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,3,no,5,"Premium/Business class in the month of August KL - Seoul Busan - KL. Melb - KL Sydney - KL. Recently Air Asia tried to rename the premium class to business class. I found the word business class really misleading because it is not a business class yet premium seat is more like it. Well whatever name you call it you cannot only book the ""new business class"" to and from Kuala Lumpur. If you are flying out to and from any Malaysia small city you are blocked from booking the business class. The implication is that the passenger need to purchase multiple itineraries and no luggage check through to the final destination. Why is Air Asia doing this? It is very inconvenient for business man like us when we need to rush from one gate to another and what more to say rushing to collect luggage and check in again. Imagine with the new KLIA2. One has to be really fit to do the long walk and keep the figure cross that he/she can locate the other gate safely. I travel a lot in the ""old premium class"" sometimes it is value for money when it is on offer. There is not much service and no entertainment but it comes with free meals and luggage. It is not that exclusive anyway economy class passenger can just walk pass you anytime anyhow."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,I was informed via email that my flight had been changed from 4.20pm to 3.00pm which was fine but airport services were in fact terrible! Arriving at the counter at 1.15pm I asked the counter if there was a delay in our flight I was told that there was no such delay for our flight and that our boarding time was at 2.30pm. 2.30pm came and went and there was no announcement made regarding our flight. There was no one at the AirAsia departure lounge counter so I went to the check in counter and asked staff what our flight status was. I was then informed that there would be announcements. 3.00pm - no announcements. 3.49pm still no announcements. 4.17pm no announcement. 4.28pm an announcement that our flight will be delayed 1 hour. 5.35pm an announcement that the plane will not arrive until 6.05pm. 6.08pm arrival of the plane. 6.35pm boarding. 7.00pm on the flight I asked the flight attendant for my pre purchased comfort kit and was informed that they did not have any on the flight. As you can imagine after spending over 3hours waiting for the flight and being told that my comfort kit was not available I was mighty ticked. I know that there are circumstances that flight will be delayed and I understand that but the lack of communication given to customers was poor. I had heard such good things regarding AirAsia but after this and the cancelation of our Clark to Kalibo flight on the 14th of November 2013 I will be very hesitant and wary of using AirAsia again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,5,yes,8,We flew Kuala Lumpur to Singapore on 1 August 2014. Total cost was 927MYR (£171 or just 329 each). We were astounded at the high quality of the flight the cleanliness of the aircraft and the friendliness and professionalism of the crew. Having paid a very low price (to us in England) we were expecting a below-Ryanair experience but this was anything but. Proper seats seat back pockets a wide range of snacks- this was far higher standard than Finnair offered on their Manchester-Helsinki flights. Will not hesitate to use AirAsia again.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Low cost flight low cost quality. Flew from Kuala Lumpur to Sydney. Then from Melbourne to Singapore in April 2014. The second flight was cancelled at the last minute so obliged to take midnight flight. Hours standing in a queue to check in luggage. Seats narrow and uncomfortable. No entertainment. Food and drink expensive with little choice.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew DMK (Don Muang) - SIN (Changi) many months ago. Very good Low-Cost Airline. Recommend for the Low-Cost Ticket.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Flew lately with them from KUL to PEN and I loved the airline. I also pre-ordered their in-flight meal service which was delicious and promptly delivered once on board. On return flight the flight was delayed by 2 hrs. but I needed to be back in KUL on time so I booked another airline on my way back to KUL. Later I exchanged a few e- mails with their station manager in PEN so they handled my delay costs very professionally. All in all not a bad airline to fly with around Asia. Only negative side is that they use low-cost terminal at KUL which you can not compare with a satellite Terminal.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,7,My 17 year old son and I were on a 43 day round the world holiday. While in Rome I was emailed that Air Asia 29 June 2014 QZ266 CGK-SIN. The whole trip is good. Staff were friendly. The seat was small with little leg room. The Inflight Entertainment isn't very nice.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,4,no,8,Flew Air Asia in June 2014 from Surat Thani to Kuala Lumpur. The Surat Thani airport is very small you go down an escalator and walk onto the tarmac to board the plane. The plane boarded on-time and very quickly. The flight staff were still vacuuming when I boarded! They boarded the plane quickly and had an easy departure and easy landing. The distance between seats is really small. I am not a big person but these seats are very close! They do recline but not much. Not very comfortable for a long flight but for a short flight you can put up with it. The price was pretty reasonable. They do charge for everything though. I paid extra for a seat assignment one piece of luggage and a chicken dinner. Total came to around $2600 Bhat which is about $80 USD. For a short flight it was fine although the seats are not very comfortable.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,My 17 year old son and I were on a 43 day round the world holiday. While in Rome I was emailed that Air Asia cancelled 2 of our segments and replaced them with another 2. The first was only an hour delay so no big deal. However the second one put us into SGN too late to make our connecting flight on to DAD. As soon as we landed in BKK I went to the Air Asia help desk and explained my problem. BTW This is a Thai Air Asia flight. The 2 young staff members couldn't have helped me more. They understood my problem and did a great job fixing it. I've flown them several times and they're a first class low fare carrier. When they charge you for food and drinks on board it's at a reasonable amount. They now only operate out of Don Muang (DMK) but there is a free shuttle between DMK and BKK airport. Great airline great crew in the air and on the ground.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,5,yes,8,June 7 2014 AK6110 KLIA2 - Penang. Boarding was ok although I didn't hear a call. The seat was small little leg room. It is ok for the short flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,6,BKK-HDY-BKK return. Observed significant improvement from cabin crew they seemed to be smiling and really welcomed you on board these flights. Decided to bypass hassle at check-in counter by internet check in pre- printed boarding pass and not loading luggage which is a good decision. The journey become very uneventful compare to the past experience. Aircraft new and clean as usual. Only criticism for buy on board food (evening flight) which all hot food completely sold out what left of sandwiches choices are badly stale.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,5,yes,5,PER-DPS-PER. Positives were cost clean aircraft and a good selection of flight times. However I was concerned with the level of hygiene in the toilets. On both flights soap was not provided which essentially means that nobody was able to wash their hands properly which is poor infection control particularly when there are 180 people confined to a small space for a long period of time. Flight attendants and crew could be more clearer on the PA system as well. Food good but a lot cheaper if pre ordered.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,no,3,KUL-MNL-KUL. The airport where Air Asia international flights depart is supposed to be a domestic airport. My flight was at 4.20pm. I arrived at the airport around 1.30pm. Past 2pm they were not still letting us in. The waiting area and check in area is still serving the earlier flight to Korea. They just have 2 check in counters and 2 immigration counters of a supposed to be international terminal. I am from the Philippines and I feel for the foreigners who were with me on this terminal. I hope Air Asia can transfer all of their international flights to Terminal 3. Will take Air Asia to Manila once they transfer.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,4,yes,6,"DMK-PHN-DMK via FD 606 and 607 respectively. Flight was on time with a couple minutes late. Both flight was close to full as it was holiday week in Cambodia. Once again nothing much to complain or pride. Except I noticed the quality of ground crew and flight attendant going downward. Unfriendly and very unapproachable. I know this is a low-fare airline however given the price paid for at least a smile or ""welcome aboard"" is shown to the customers."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,5,yes,7,LOP-KUL 17 May. I checked in online and got the boarding pass. Since I had no checked-in baggage I went straight to the immigration counter which was very convenient and save a lot of time. The flight was delayed for 1.5 hours. Luckily the ground staff provided us with a simple meal. The flight was not full. I had the whole row to myself so that I could lie down during the entire flight. Of course the flight arrived late. The FA was ok. The seat pitch is a little bit short for me. I didn’t order any on-board meal as I just had dinner prior to the flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,no,8,PER-KUL-HND in April with my 2 year old son. The flights were fine on time and pleasant for the fare paid. However two weeks ago received an email from Air Asia stating that my return KUL-PER flight 26 May has been cancelled - 'for commercial reasons'. Checking their website this particular 0850 KUL departure for Perth no longer appears. So they have just cancelled the flight because the were not enough passengers. As a result instead of a 2 hour connection in KUL I now have an 18 hour connection at KUL. No compensation offered or even interest in the gross inconvenience to passengers who have booked and paid on the basis of a reasonable connection. What can one do for 18 hours with a 2 year old child at KUL? Their customer service is simply mealy mouthed excuses and the claim that a stopover hotel is 'not within their service recovery'. Service recover for whom? Formerly loyal Air Asia customers. No longer.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,5,yes,8,SIN-DPS / DPS-SIN Travelled with my parents last week and had booked wheelchair assistance both ways for our trip. At check in at Changi this was confirmed and my dad was well taken care of right up till he was seated. Cabin crew professional organised and polite. Seat comfort was ok legroom is tight but that was expected. Departure and arrival were both almost 40 mins late. Wheelchair was waiting after deplaning via stairs at Bali. (I did wonder how we would have managed getting my dad down had he not been able to use the stairs..) Fortunately he did and he was met by a friendly ground staff who took him all the way through. Bags were out quickly. Return from bali was equally efficiently handled. No problems with the wheel chair request and early boarding. All in all very impressed with Air Asia's professionalism and well run operation.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,5,yes,7,Travelled with family on KL-Chiang Mai and thoroughly enjoyed the smooth and on-time flights. The pre-booked meals were ok and the crews service was well above average to my surprise. Entertainment - not applicable.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,4,no,4,Return flight from Bangkok to Udon Thanni. The four members of staff at boarding gate were either sleeping or playing with their phones. None took any interest in the customers despite the flight boarding time coming and going with no announcements. On the return flight 5 days later the cabin crew failed to notice 3 extremely drunk passengers who I guess were automatically allocated online emergency exit seats! When I told the cabin crew about this they asked them to move and one of the crew later thanks me. I sat in one of the emergency exit seats and was given no extra information which was unusual as every time prior when seated on such seats the staff took the trouble to make sure I was familiar with how to open the door in the very unlikely event of an emergency.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,I flew from Darwin to Bali on 21 April and from Bali to Darwin on 25 April. That was our first time trying Air Asia and we will not try again. On both days Air Asia was delayed for about 2 hour. There would have been no time to have the crew check the plane before it departed again.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"7th May from Jakarta to Denpasar Bali. Flight QZ7532. Every single time I flew AA the flight was delayed. They usually use a random excuse like ""delay due to the late arrival of the aircraft"". This time 15 min before boarding I asked if the flight was on time. I was extremely surprised to hear that yes the flight was on time. 10 min before departure I enquired again as I couldn't see the airplane at the gate. Only then I was told that the flight was 2 hours delayed. As a pilot myself I know that staying on schedule is not always easy but being late by that much without having the ground staff to inform the passengers on PA I thought that was extremely bad. They can't care less about their passengers."
,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Had the worst travelling experience travelling to and from Sydney to Phuket via KL. Hated every minute of it. Appalling service from the minute of check in both ends. Do not waste your time nor paper checking in beforehand. Do not buy food on board (maybe chips would be ok). Will never recommend nor use again.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"Yesterday I flew from Thailand to Malaysia. Air Asia charges extra for every possible option. I booked a ""hot seat"" which should have priority boarding. No priority was ever offered and I was stuck in a mad rush of people to get on the plane. I also pre-booked food. I saw the flight attendants bring food to several passengers around me but passed by me with the food cart. I had to call the flight attendant with the button and only after my boarding pass was inspected was my food served. The portion was inadequate to say the least. The bathroom was out of soap and when I again used the call button to get out of sight flight attendant's attention she explained that there had been many flight segments and that the soap had run out. No apology was offered although she did suggest I use the bathroom in the back. Trying to explain that the airplane should be serviced at every stop regardless of how many flight segments there are in a day was useless and she felt it was not her or the airline's fault that there was no soap. After about 45 minutes the entire flight crew went to the back of the plane and closed the curtain while they read the newspaper and chatted. No one was in the front of the aircraft until landing. The floor of the plane had bits of trash all about. The worst flight I have ever been on."
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,yes,6,Flew with Thai Air Asia from Yangon via Bangkok to Siem Reap and from Saigon via Bangkok back to Yangon. The only major problem was when we had to check in a bag (15kg) in Saigon for a whopping US$72. It was more than I paid for my ticket. Service not bad planes are clean and FAs are friendly. Bought food for US$6 - extremely small portion and not worth it.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,5,Chiang Mai to Krabi. This is by no means a budget carrier due to their increasing prices. They were the only carrier to offer a direct flight less than two hours (avoiding BKK) but at a cost of almost £300 one way for two people. Thai Bangkok and Nokair all stopped at Bangkok. Nothing given for free on board no entertainment. You got to pay for luggage and I couldn't fathom out how not to pay for their insurance! Better and cheaper fares offered with main airline carriers. Although the flight was straightforward.
,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Air Asia at first glance looks like a great deal but beware! As stated by others on this site they consistently block you from checking in online and pre-paying your bags. So on a domestic flight from Phuket to Bangkok instead of $330 baht per bag (about $10-11 US per bag) we had to pay a whopping $900 per bag (about $30 US per bag!) and it was their fault that we couldn't follow their procedure to check-in and pre-pay online. If you are sick (like I was) on the flight don't expect an air sickness bag in the pocket at your seat nor a blanket you have to buy the blanket. The flight was chaotic! There were toddlers running up and down the aisles screaming the entire flight with the flight attendants allowing it never mind the danger to the children! In-flight entertainment? None. Spend the extra and fly a real airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,Air Asia Indonesia: Recently travelled from Perth to Bali and Bali to Darwin with Air Asia Indonesia. The airline and staff were fantastic from check in to baggage collection. Can't recommend highly enough. Paid for the Red Carpet option in Bali and this was well worth the $30.00 dollars. The lounge was great as was the complimentary food and drink. We flew with Qantas from Melbourne to Perth and compared to Air Asia they were sadly lacking.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,7,Flown from CCU-KUL (LCCT) and back. Comfortable flight. As with any low cost carrier you could buy food and drinks on board. The flight attendants were nice and friendly. Only down side was lack of inflight entertainment and poor leg room.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,7,"We flew FD2603 DMK-CSX on 16/09/14 and returned by FD FD2604 on 19/03/14. The DMK-CSX boarding was delayed because staff were not at the gate at departure time. We were informed that they had been busy with another gate and thus no staff were available for our gate. The boarding thus became messy although we managed to get through because of our priority boarding seat privilege. On the return flight our group consisted of 13 persons with 4 booking codes. We were told to check-in as a group and we were the first group to check in at the counter. Our queue however was overtaken by another tour group. We had to ""protest"" in order to have our queue maintained. Check-in was slow and rather inefficient and we were informed that it is because the staff are new. BTW the inflight services are OK on both legs. Web-ordered meals were reasonable. Finally when we arrived at DMK three of our luggage had lost the luggage tags. Fortunately there was not much baggage and we could identify them. But imagine if this were a connecting flight or several pieces of baggage was involved?"
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,The worst airline in the world in terms of customer service. I booked a series of flights 8 months in advance. Air Asia moved one of the flights causing a connection to be not possible. Air Asia then refused to allow me to move the flights to fix the connection conflict they caused and refused to give me a refund. I wonder what happens if I take the flights and get stranded when one flight lands after the connection has already taken off?
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,5,yes,9,KUL-SIN-KUL. Return flight to Singapore for a day trip. $40 return so cant complain about the price. No issues with check in on both legs. Fairly new A320s which for some reason had very old worn seats (maybe moved from their older retired aircraft). That is probably the only minor complaint. Cabin crew friendly and efficient managed to serve meals and drinks and clean up on a very short 45 min flight. Both flights landed on time. Over all a good experience would fly with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,2,Flew Phuket to Chiang Mai and got dinged nearly $60 CAD ($55 US) for a 20 kg bag. When I picked myself up off the floor I asked the desk person if I could avoid this sticker shock on my return flight. Told to go to the website check in online and 'pre-register' my bag online. The savings would be 'significant'. So today I did just that. Only problem - when it came to registering the bag the website froze me out - even after multiple attempts. Simply couldn't register the bag let alone pay a lower fee for it. When we got to the airport I explained the situation. We had checked in online so it was clear I wasn't pulling anyone's leg about trying to get things done on the website. But the check in person gave me the cow in a pasture stare and charged me full freight for the bag again. I explained again it wasn't my fault - I'd tried to do what her colleague had recommended - but their website wasn't working. I then told my story to the person who took my money. Same look. So watch out! Bag charges are exorbitant and going online to lessen the charge brings no joy.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,KL to Kota Kinabalu. I was hoping for a more Malaysian style welcome however I was not even shown to my seats. The cabin crew were fixing their hair and make up and chatting. I was not offended but in my 18 years of flying I have never seen such sight.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,5,yes,9,DPS-PER. A320. Booked hot seats row 14 exit row but would have preferred row 1 - not available. Also booked Red Carpet departure from Bali. I can't recommend this enough. A great treat to be personally escorted from check in security customs. Then lounge access. Although the shared lounge was very ordinary. No fault of AirAsia. When flight was called we were again escorted through departure gate into private mini-bus to the plane. The rest of the queuing passengers seemed aghast to our VIP treatment but well worth ever cent. In fact the cost is minimal. On board meals were OK but limited breakfast are ordered Hotcakes. Flight attendants smiling and answering bells quickly but difficult to understand announcements as others have mentioned. Plane about 50% full. Many seats at rear from row 15 with people stretching out across. No cockpit announcements at all and late arrival by 20 minutes into Perth. Priority luggage off easily.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,5,yes,5,Perth to Bali. A320. Booked hot seats row 1. Meal included but we weren't priority boarded as the website indicated. Crew friendly and helpful. Flight slight turbulence but arrived on time. New plane. Only hiccup was online check in with no luggage says we can go straight to departure gate but lucky we checked as you still need to go to web check in desk to reprint boarding pass. Plus many passengers in the wrong line up. One row for online web check and one not. Ground staff didn't appear interested that all passengers queuing all in one line. Signage was poorly indicating.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,,,3,yes,7,Air Asia Indonesia. QZ8322 21 Mar 2014 DMK-CGK (A320). Website check-in is convenient check-in agents are good and smiling and oblige if you want to change to an Aisle seat. Boarding in DMK is Manual and the staff check recheck and re- recheck if you have boarded or not. Crew welcoming and point to your seat. Announcements so fast no one can understand them. Safety demonstrations are very good and clear to the point. Food looks like it has been recycled on 2 or more flights I had pre-booked meal (Pak Nassers Nasi Lemak) as I'm allergic to fish however the meal included Anchovies. Again on landing the announcements were so fast that we all just looked at each other in a daze. Overall I will fly them again but will bring my own food and water.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,,,3,yes,7,Air Asia Indonesia. QZ8320 23 Mar 2014 CGK-DMK (A320). Website check-in is convenient CGK check-in agents are good and smiling and oblige if you want to change to an Aisle seat. Boarding in CGK is utter chaos and staff are in Go away Go away mode. Again Crew welcoming and point to your seat (the Weekend uniform is extremely untidy it kills the image). Announcements again so fast. Safety demonstrations are very good and clear to the point. Food again looks like it has been recycled 2 or more flights I had pre-booked meal (Satay with Asian Fried rice). Again no information that it contained Shrimp paste (I'm allergic to Seafood). On landing the announcements were so fast. Overall I will fly them again but as I said in my previous comment will bring my own food and water.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,5,yes,8,Departed Perth to Denpasar return with the family. No delays on either flight. Service was standard budget airline though much better than Ryan or Easyjet. My only complaint is regarding the unbelievably bad quality of the inflight hot meals. I pre ordered them to simply break the boredom for the kids and wish I hadn't bothered. Disgusting and simply inedible.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"Air Asia D7316 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing March 12-13. We have flown on airlines throughout the world and have never been on a worse airline in 50 years of flying. Kuala Lumpur airport is awful. When you ask if there are meals provided they say ""yes"" but don't tell you that you are required to pay extra. If you have cashed in your money because you are flying into another country you are out of luck. We were 6 hours without a coffee water or tea. When we asked for a complimentary coffee the flight attendant said ""No we are a low cost airline"". They nickel and dime you all the way. When you check in they ask if you would like to check your bag. Then hit you with a $30 charge! However they let all kinds of over-sized bags on the plane so getting to your seat is total chaos. Loading the plane is a joke. It is basically a stampede to the plane out on the tarmac it is a total free for all on the tarmac."
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,4,yes,8,DMK-PHN-DMK - Not much to write about frankly as this is a low-fair airline. Having their base in DMK airport is a strategic move away from the chaotic Suvarnbhumi. Make sure you booked earlier as the ticket will be almost as expensive as the regular cost airline given booking only a couple weeks ahead. Check-in both DMK and PHN is no problem. Though I seem to have problem with mobile online check-in from my last trip.
,,,,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,5,yes,8,Pleasant surprise! Even if check-in was somewhat chaotic (in Krabi) the flight experience was nice. Clean plane comfortable seats and nice crew. Will fly them again and the prices are great.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,2,yes,7,REP-KUL. I must say that fares aren't that much cheaper than full service airlines if you only book a few weeks in advance. There are a lot of additional fees some of which are not avoidable. If you have to change your flight you will get clobbered. Check-in was another problem. Their website says that international check-in opens 3 hours before the flight - not true. The check-in did not open until 2 hours before. Once it did the queue did move at a painfully slow pace. The agent seem to have problems with every person checking in and had to call the supervisor over more than once for every passenger. I'd checked in online but not printed my boarding pass (as I had a mobile one sent to my mobile). This caused a lot of problems and needed the supervisor. Once through security everything was a breeze. Organised boarding great cabin crew clean plane comfortable seats and good food. I'd check to see how much you're actually saving before using Air Asia. If its enough then book it.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,Kuala Lumpur to Phuket. Really good value for money. Plane is new. Very punctual. Cabin crew are well trained and nicely dressed. Seat is fine. Food is inexpensive but good quality and you can choose from a quite diversified menu. Boarding and disembarkation was organized very efficiently. Only inconvenience is you had to walk at KUL budget terminal for 10min from gate to plane through a shielded corridor.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,Have flown with AA a few times this time RT from CNX to PEN. On the way from CNX to PEN I had to pay for the first checked baggage twice just because I had a transit in Kuala Lumpur. You will never know where they are going to put you in the airplane unless you pay to choose seat.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,5,yes,7,"We flew Air Asia twice during our trip to SE Asia. I found the process of check-in well organized and tolerable. A low cost airline is going to have large crowds to manage and they did a good job. The seats are tight but no worse than more expensive airlines. Ads are tedious but I am sure these keep the cost down. All in all a satisfactory experience. They got us where we wanted to go efficiently and on schedule. Isn't that what a ""Now everybody can fly"" airline supposed to do?"
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1,no,2,While at Singapore Changi Airport it took me more than 2.5 hrs to queue just to check in. The AirAsia counters were grossly under staffed with 2 to 3 staff members frantically trying to process up to 4 or 5 flights of passengers. There was not enough staff to manage the queue many passengers were fed up and started queue jumping. Many passengers were late to board the plane not to mention time to shop the DFS stores. My flight to Bali took off an hour late. Worst experience I had with a budget airline.
,,,,,,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,4,Kuala Lumpur to Manila. Pre flight customer service was a nightmare. My flight was delayed before my trip I was sent an SMS to be advised of this. I was offered an earlier flight that wasn't going to work because I was travelling from Adelaide at that time. There were no changes made and they acknowledged there was no change. When I arrived in KL to check in they inform me my flight was changed to the earlier flight. There was a lot of hassle and waiting but I was provided with my boarding pass. Flight was good aircraft could do with some updating but the flight was half empty which meant flat bed. Check in gave me a hot seat without paying for it. As soon as seat belt sign was off I went to sleep staff left me alone and it was all good. Cant comment on food or how the service was but as far as I am concerned in the air I got what I wanted. The selection of food is quite bland I would prefer to just take my food on board. For the price it was not bad. When it comes to Staff service I have based it on the pre customer service as that's where I experienced most of the customer service.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,5,yes,8,Three short flights on Air Asia DMK-RGN RGN-DMK DMK-SGN. All flights via newish A320s. A little chaotic at check in for DMK flights but otherwise the boarding process was easy. Be aware though that they strictly enforce their carry on baggage regulations and I suggest you pay for a checked bag when you buy your ticket and carefully weigh it before check in. Plane interiors clean comfort OK for short flight and service friendly but I hate the banner ads on the luggage bins. Checked bags were delivered promptly on arrival.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,no,5,Kota Kinabalu Malaysia to Jakarta Indonesia. Value for money. No inflight entertainment. Food needs to be paid for with cash onboard. Terrible option for food. Seat is disaster. Nice airline to take for short distances due to economy value. Future travel will avoid this airline. Prefer Malaysia Airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Delayed more than 3 hours on flight to Bali from Kuala Lumpur on 9 Jan 2014. Although the ground staff knew about the delay in advance they failed to inform the passengers early - not only were we not informed at check in counter but only 1 hour prior scheduled take off time when we were at the gate. The airline changed the flight number causing great confusion and inconvenience for all passengers. No embarkation cards were also given out on board which is a normal procedure with all airlines. Air Asia maybe a budget airline but this does not give it a right to do what they want and as they please. Terrible experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,KUL-PDG and KNO-KUL. Always a demonstration for a quality product on the ground and in the sky. Good information from booking until departure well trained and nice-to-look-at cabin crews good flight-deck-info good food and on-time. This airlines grows and grows and seems to have no visible problems with staff quantity/training logistics etc.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,AirAsia failed to get me CGK-JKT on Christmas Eve. All they offered was flight to Sydney and Melbourne - and make your own way there. Couldn't offer me a direct flight for 48 hours from KUL although MAS had spare seats.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,5,yes,7,We travelled from Singapore to Krabi by Airasia Thailand on 29th December 2013. I have to say that I am not pleased with the punctuality of the airline. We were delayed as the flight arrived 20 minutes late from Krabi. Delayed again on the way back to Singapore. However the flight was smooth and seats were comfortable for a low cost carrier. A strange incident happened as we were approaching the terminal in Singapore. We were all ready to leave the aircraft when the pilot announced that we would push back to another gate. The process itself took another 30 minutes. So overall we were delayed by over an hour. But still the flight was very smooth and good.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,5,yes,7,"Air Asia Indonesia. KUL-CGK on 12/26 and CGK-SIN on 12/30. Both flights experienced delays. The first was due to arriving aircraft (two hours) and the second was due to ATC in SIN (boarded on time but one hour delay on the plane). The seats were comfortable for the short flights. The legroom was also adequate. I'm 5'11"" (180 cm) and I had a small amount of space in between my knees and the seat in front of me. That being said for a long flight three hours plus it would get a bit tiring. I pre-ordered a meal which tasted fine. Unfortunately it was on a flight that was delayed for two hours and departed after Midnight and I had already eaten the same meal unknowingly twice before. Definitely wasn't in the mood. The price is cheap sure but expect a two hour delay every time which means lots of waiting. For our flight KUL-CGK there was no announcement of any delay until after the scheduled departure time (but they kept making announcements for other delays). Bring your patience for sure."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,July 16th Bangkok Don Muang to Phuket. Last year we arrived 20 minutes before departure at Don Muang airport in Bangkok (very difficult to reach during rush hour). There where several queues and we asked some Air Asia ground personnel if they could help. They helped us and about one minute before departure we entered the plain. Arriving in Phuket our luggage was also in good condition and well kept by the aircraft personnel. I think that Air Asia is worth the money.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,3,yes,7,Airasia Indonesia. SUB-CGK. Overall the trip was good. The cabin crews were polite. But the staff service wasn't very good when I entered the boarding gate the staff hasn't placed the airport tax thing behind the boarding pass although we had paid to her. Because of that we should wait for minutes before boarding the aircraft.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"I flew to Singapore from Sydney with Air Asia last week. I regret flying with AA. Pre-ordered meals were of very poor quality. There was a only very limited selection of food available for purchase - only peanuts chocolates and fizzy drinks. The flight was freezing cold and I had to pay money to rent a basic blanket. No credit cards are accepted on board. If you pay in dollars balance is paid in MYR- another rip off! There were 2 small children about 10 and 12 years travelling with their parents who changed their seats and moved near to a window just before we landed in KL to get a aerial view of KL. Many hot seats were unoccupied and were vacant throughout the flight and there was at most 20 min flight time left. The children were asked to return to their original seats by the flight attendant as they were not entitled to sit in ""hot"" seats. I thought the way they said was quite rude. The flight attendants speak little English. They are careless. I think what they sell as business class is probably as comfortable as Qantas Economy."
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,10,Impressed by flight FD3932 from Changi Airport to Don Mueang on the night of 5th Dec 2013. No long queue at Terminal 1 check in counter the staff really helpful toward us when I ask to be seat together with older parents. Though the aircraft had just arrived the crew showed no sign of tiredness and were helpful on boarding. Captain made announcement about the weather and greeted us when we started to fly into Thai air space. It's a little things that's count.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,It isn't low cost there are additions to the fares such as seat selection fee baggage fee meal fee and other hidden fees which all adds to and cost as near as a decent airlines like Thai Airways. Their services from ground to in-flight staff were inefficient. KOL-HKT 5 of us were travelling including my 2 year old daughter. Bangkok- Phuket being a short haul flight I skipped the seat selection (my biggest mistake). I told the lady at the check- in counter that we required 3 seats together minutes later our luggage was through and we were handed the boarding passes. All 5 of us were placed at different seats far from each other. Upon boarding I wasn't going to sit down until 3 of us were seated next to each other. A stewardess found 3 passengers who felt sorry for our situation and swapped seats. I saw their so called hot seats for which you pay extras for extra leg room were not any different from those ordinary seats. The seats were so cramped that you can hardly move if the seat in front was reclined back. Air Asia can change their flight timings anytime they want so stay tuned and updated. Our flight was postponed nearly 24 hrs.They claimed that they did try to contact me. At the sales desk we were told to wait an hour and see if there were any no shows. There were so we rushed to check-in luggage through and then told that there are only four seats left and we must hold the baby in our lap. We had no choice rushed to the aircraft as the last call was announced. We struggled just like before with the separated seats even though this time I had pre-selected seats with the original flight. We also had pre-booked meals with the original flight but since we boarded on a different flight they wouldn't serve us any meal. Air Asia in Bangkok lands at Don Muang Airport and not the Suvarnabhumi. The difference in two is that the Don Muang airport is an old airport and later is a new one. Everyone goes on a holiday to have a good time. Your holiday starts from the moment you are in the aircraft. Go for that little extra spending and choose a renowned airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,yes,7,Flew from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur and then KL to Melbourne. Check-in online simply didn't work for us using any type of computer. Was also unable to manage my booking as system never allowed us to log in. Check in at Bangkok airport horrendous. Had to argue with check in agent to change seats so both of us were seated together (something we attempted numerous times online). Book with realistic expectations as that's all you will receive. Make sure you're at the gate in plenty of time as the gate suddenly closes with no announcements.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,I with my wife travelled from Chennai to Kuala Lumpur on 5th Nov 2013 and from KL to Adelaide on 9th Nov 2013. Both the flights were comfortable and enjoyed journey.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,3,Flight from Guangzhou to Kuala Lumpur. All of their service is what the low cost airlines have. Normal seat without IFE without food serving. Recommend during great promotion and travel with only cabin baggage (quite expensive check-in baggage fee).
,,,,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,5,yes,10,I'm not sure what people are expecting when flying with a low cost airline. My trip Bali - Singapore was great maybe having average expectations when booking helped. I made a point of reading the fine print on the Air Asia website which saved me money by pre-booking my luggage and my seat first row of the plane. I was also happy to have paid for the meet and greet option as there were long check-in queues at 05.00 with 3 Air Asia flights departing early. No queue for me right to the front and then assisted with passport control and led to the business lounge (the lounge was pretty poor not Air Asia's fault). Crew were young polite and efficient. Well- done Air Asia!
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,5,yes,9,Chennai to Singapore with a stopover in Kuala Lumpur. The journey was great. Even though the flight from Chennai was delayed by half an hour and the seats were not so comfy I liked this airline because of the hospitality and cost. Thank you Airasia for this wonderful journey.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,5,yes,8,DMK-PNH. Flight delayed maybe 30 min but arrived 15 min late. Communication regarding delay not sufficient. Otherwise very good flight in clean plane with friendly staff - as every time I've flown Air Asia. Did not have a meal on this flight but on previous flights food has varied between 2 & 4 stars in my book.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,,,5,yes,7,I have flown six times with Air Asia this year and have found it to be a good airline for the price. The staff are friendly and the check-in staff have been helpful. The planes are always clean and comfy. The only down side to Air Asia is their KL terminal. The terminal is confusing the flights are nearly always late and the walk from the terminal to the plane can be long (especially if it is windy and raining). But for friendliness cleanliness and price I would recommend Air Asia.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,5,yes,9,Traveled from COK to KUL (LCCT) and back on AK 1203/1204. The in-flight services were truly good and the on time performance has to be highlighted.
,,,Premium Economy,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,3,no,1,I have traveled this airline twice. While their inflight service is average I found other aspects to be quite awful. I travel extensively across US Europe and Asia so have a good basis of comparison. If there is a problem - don't expect any competent problem solving. Ground staff are poorly trained and unhelpful in case of a problem. First time I traveled my flight from Phuket to Bangkok was delayed several hours and they had no idea when the flight was going to depart or even which gate it would depart from. On a recent flight from Siem Reap to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur several transit passengers had to be offloaded because they could not transit through KL - you need to enter the country and then exit via immigration so those from countries requiring visas were not able to board. They have no transit facilities at their hub in KL. The website clearly states they have through transit facilities - to this the passengers were told by the ground staff manager that the website is frequently incorrect and cannot be relied on. So that is the other problem - their website is unreliable and not kept current by their own admission. which in this day and age is totally unacceptable. Their terminal in KL is awful - it makes a Greyhound bus terminal seem sophisticated and comfortable. There is no place to sit and its bursting at the seams with passengers. If you have a long stopover be prepared to stand around or sit on the floor or on your bag. There is little to eat or drink until after you go past immigration to the gate but you can't check in to your flight until 2 hours before departure - so if you have a long break between flights you better come equipped. I have taken my last flight on AirAsia - it is truly the worst airline I have flown. The inflight service however is OK given its a totally discount airline with no frills whatsoever - you will pay for everything including water.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,5,KUL-SIN-KUL. Overall flight experience is fair only. Flight delayed 20 min because one of the crews absence and had to wait for another staff to replace. The staff seem to be moody and not so friendly from KUL-SIN but from SIN-KUL the staff are happy and providing good service.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5,yes,10,"JKT-KUL. Flight was slightly behind schedule pre-booked a meal that tasted delicious. Flight attendants were in a good mood and the senior FA wished us ""happy Sunday and god bless you"". That made my day. Was on board the new plane. Looked very clean and the plane look liked it had been cleaned regularly."
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,Don Muang - Phuket - Don Muang. Pre-booked assigned seats together (65bht) and meals (120 bht) in booking. Both flights excellent value at promo fares offered and even with the extras came to just over 100 pounds return for 2 people return. Flights on time aircraft very clean check-in at both airports very efficient. Airline food on way out OK but way back actually very good for an airline hot meal (roast chicken and thai green curry options for the return flight). Euro low cost carriers could learn a lot from the service and pricing model of their Asian counterparts. Only minor gripe is the lack of use of airbridge except departing Don Muang and wait for luggage on return flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5,yes,10,SRG-KUL. Check in at Semarang airport was very messy and immigration was slow. Plane arrived early and at around 9am we took off. The meal that I ordered was delicious and the crew was very friendly towards the passengers. Don't expect too much from a low cost airline but at least the service offered by air Asia is good value for money highly recommended.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,SYD - KUL - PEN - SIN. Was nervous about using a budget carrier but need not have been. SYD - KUL loads of spare seats around us at rear of plane. Samsung tablet provided decent entertainment. Food was as expected. KUL - PEN was delayed around 90 minutes with no announcement or board notice of when we would actually depart which was a little frustrating. Both KUL - PEN and PEN - SIN flights were cramped but for short flights at a bargain cost who cares. Will happily fly them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,4,yes,8,Udon Thani - Phuket - Udon Thani. Both flights on time. Check in at Phuket a bit crazy because of Thai peoples lack of ability to understand which line to be in. Good friendly crew who explained the safety drill in perfect English. Captains announcements also perfectly spoken and clear. Soft drinks snacks and hot dishes are served at a cost which is not expensive. Overall a very enjoyable experience and would recommend to others.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,7,Bangkok - Macau return 20th Sep return on 22nd. Excellent flight for low budget airline choose the first row in plane priority boarding. Only problem was the 20 minutes delay with no explanations.
,,,,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,4,yes,9,I flew from KL to Miri and it was very pleasant. I was late and was the last passenger to board but Air Asia were very nice about it. Flight was smooth and arrived on time. Can't think of a single thing to criticise them except food could be better.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,5,yes,8,I did six flights with AirAsia Indonesia and AirAsiaX from Sydney KL Makassar Denpasar Makassar KL Sydney. I found the airline to be exactly up to my expectations. It's a budget no frills low airfare airline. I'm not too tall 1.8m and not too fat 73 kgs so it was fine for me. The food was good and if I didn't want any extras I didn't have to pay for them. It was about half the fare on Jetstar/Qantas. Neither of which went to my main destination of Makassar.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,5,yes,10,5/8/13 BKK-KUL FD2913 11/8/13 TGG-KUL AK6229. 12/8/13 KUL-Lombok AK1408. 24/8/13 DPS-BKK FD2977. I have recently flown several times on Air Asia. The planes have been immaculate the staff very helpful and they have an amazing turn around time and have always been on time. I was thoroughly impressed by the service and feel the budget airlines in Europe could learn a lot from them! We paid extra for a hot seat and were very comfortable with plenty of leg space. The price of this was cheap and I believe worth it. Baggage came through really quickly too. Only thing is no inflight entertainment at all but I was happy to use my iPad.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,9,Flew 4 times back in May 2013 as they are no doubt the major low-cost airline in Asia. One is DMK-PHN and another one is DMK-HKT. Both are returned flight. Good move by Thai AirAsia for choosing DMK as their hub - less hassle and easy to get to. Check-in was easy and it is how you talk with the check-in staff in order to get seat you want/close to your partner/friend. I flew with my fiancé so we did manage to get the seat we want by just talking your way through. Aircraft is a new A319 which was a complete step-up from their old B737 a couple years ago I flew with them. Nothing fancy about cabin crew as we did not use their service at all (not buying any food). I would definitely fly them again - just because of their competitive price compared to other airline such as Bangkok Airways and Thai Airways.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,8,DMK-SGN. First ever flight on the Air Asia group and I was greatly surprised. DMK is great with Air Asia international check in very easy. Plane was new clean and on-time. Crew were relaxed and friendly. The hot seat exit row is money well spent - did not bother with food on such a short leg. I would definitely recommend this airline and will readily use them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,5,"March 9 2013. DMK-KUL AK1941. March 12 2013 KUL-DMK FD2916. You cannot expect much from a low cost airline but Air Asia certainly hits the bottom when they not only charge a 12 USD supplement for their ""Red Seats"" where you have more knee space (although the difference is nominal) but they also charge a supplement for the other seats as if you could fly standing. But what revolted me most is that you have to pay extra charges for the use of a wheelchair (3 USD per use amounting to 12 USD for a round trip) to make money from handicapped people is a novelty."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,1,no,3,"SUB-KUL-HKT-CNX-KUL-SUB. SUB-KUL flight was pushed an hour early to 5.40am due to airport being overcrowded on Eidl Fitr holiday which was somewhat understandable. Having printed our boarding passes we still had to line up at the check in counter to pay airport tax. Once we arrived in KL we were ushered through the flight transfer area where staff informed us of our next departure gate and we had a pleasant 3 hour transit at the LCCT. Flights to and within Thailand were pleasant and punctual. Evening flight from Phuket to Chiang Mai they ran out of food by the time the crew got to our seats so we had instant noodles instead. In Chiang Mai we had to line up at the check in counter again to get a stamp in order to pass through the security check. We were rudely denied entry into the flight transfer area in KL on the way back to Surabaya because ""the flights were booked under different booking codes"". Note that there is no way to book AK and QZ flights under single purchase on the airline website and when we inquired the staff she mumbled something about ""not paying a transfer fee"" and us getting past the transfer hall last week was not meant to be part of procedure. We took our case to an immigration officer who accompanied us back to the transfer staff but turns out the immigration had to comply to airline policies. Begrudgingly we lined up at the long immigration lines to have our passports stamped entered the departure hall and lined up at the immigration again to find out that our flight was delayed 30 minutes. I am not going to fly Air Asia again unless I have no other choice."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,7,"Air Asia Japan: I got an excellent deal around 10000 yen return to Sappor half the price of ANA and JAL. One way ticket with absolutely no frills. Aircraft smelling new cabin crew quite nice seat pitch very tight but bearable for a short flight something to expect for a LCC. I was extremely surprised by their ""boarding"" gate and waiting area: it was some space taken from a warehouse and a tent from where passengers are bussed to the airplane. Although I know it's a LCC it it's not what I expected for a major international airport! Arrival and Departure at Sapporo was at a ""deluxe"" gate with a boarding bridge and normal waiting room next to ANA gates.Otherwise it was OK and good price/quality. But do not expect anything luxurious from them!"
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,4,yes,6,Pekanbaru to Bandung and vice versa. During the flight there was nothing too special. Special services for passengers with red carpet service in Pekanbaru - nothing. Should correspond to their advertising - red carpet passenger will be allowed to board the plane first but red carpet passengers in Pekanbaru were mixed with ordinary passengers during boarding. In fact there were regular passengers before me on my first flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,no,2,FD 2976/2977 Bangkok -–Denpasar return. A very disappointing experience. Checked in online and only had to drop our bag spent over an hour at the counter waiting for staff to reconcile their problem. Good that they are using Don Muang Airport otherwise the long immigration line would worsen the experience unorganized boarding and people in hot seats ended up among the last to board. Things get slightly better on the aircraft. Emergency exit “ hot seat” pretty comfortable with no other passengers next to me and I end up taking all 3 seats for myself. Pre- ordered breakfast (Pancake) is delicious great punctuality. Other than that things are pretty horrible and chaotic. Pre-ordered food on the return flight inedible rice stale meat overcooked and obviously is re-heated more than once. Drinks sold on board are lukewarm Flight attendants try to be overly friendly. Hot seat when the plane is full became unbearable for such long flight. Will avoid in the future.
,,,Premium Economy,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,PER-KUL-DMK. Booked ticket 3 months earlier received reminder/confirmation email 4 days before departure 2 days before departure another email showing different times by 5 hours - no explanation just confirmation of flights but with different departure/arrival times. Arrival at DMK (Bangkok) would have had us there 1 hour after our connecting flight had left. No option but to go 1 day earlier and stay in hotel. Chaotic check-in at DMK under staffed 1 hour just waiting to check-in not good enough especially when it's a premium ticket they claim dedicated check-in for premium but no such counter exists. At the end of it all total cost was more than $100 more each than original quote on find flights result page.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,4,yes,5,SGN-KUL-LGK-KUL-SGN. Online check in is convenient but document check in LCCT KUL (KUL-SGN) is very inconvenient for pax because of lack of information on screen (line for KUL-SGN flight) change counter and waiting at gate (Y1 Y2) so long. The arrangement in terminal is not good pax standing in font of Y1 Y2 gate will be bother by others going to oversize luggage inside. In flight LGK-KUL there was a medium turbulence on take-off phase airplane was down but no announcement was delivered.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,Air Asia Indonesia CGK-DPS. Convenient and fast. Booking process is smooth and check-in just needs a QR code and the scanner at the airport. Staff are friendly young and vibrant. I only recommend short (5 hour max) trips with them. It's a point to point carrier and not one you should use for long distance.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,,,1,no,1,Cochin to Kuala Lumpur. Most uncomfortable flight I've been on. There is practically no leg space. Add to it the fact that I had a window seat with the other two seats filled in by slightly heavyset people and I felt like I didn't even have breathing space. It was so cramped that I didn't have space to move my hands. The choice of food on board is poor. Even when I asked for something that was on the menu they didn't have it. The only good thing was the rate but given the condition of the flight even the cheap rates do not sound tempting.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,,,3,yes,8,I flew with AirAsia in May from Bandung to Pekanbaru. Overall pretty good and smooth flight. However there is a bit of chaos at the time of the boarding because it coincides with Lion Air to Surabaya at the departure gate only existing in Bandung airport.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,Flights were on time and that's about the only good thing I've experienced with this airline. Throughout my Southeast Asia journey I flew Air Asia 4 times and each time had a terrible time booking and then with customer service. Their website is a hassle to navigate and there is so many extra fees! They randomly cancel flights and rebook you without checking then when you have to rebook that flight the website doesn't work and there are no phone numbers to be found. They say they can only help you through live chat but it never works. At one point we resorted to going to the airport and talking to them where they admitted they had read out emails and just did not reply. I've never seen an airline less flyer friendly. Good thing they're cheap. Never flying air Asia again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,,4,yes,7,SYD-KUL was 30 minutes late but the food was okay. The only things I really did was play on my ipad because the flight was very boring. KU-SYD night flight was on time but no food or beverages. Toilets were clean on both flights and the seats look brilliant but 2 hours into the flight you can clearly see the poor padding. I also couldn't get to sleep on the night flight. Overall Air Asia is ok but I would prefer Qantas or Virgin.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,KUL-CMB CMB-KUL. Flight time to CMB was changed to 6 hours later and return flight to KUL was cancelled. No Refund given. Had to fly MAS to KUL.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,9,DMK-SIN SIN-HKT HKT-DMK. DMK a joy no queues large open spaces as not many pax plenty of seats easy check in at airport with bags coming in right on the weight had paid for. Zero lines at passport control and security. Had exit row hot seats for 1st leg and they were great so much leg room. Cabin staff also enforced the seats with people trying to move in to the empty row in front of us and all were removed. Only issue was passport control in Singapore all desks open but overwhelmed with the amount of people to deal with. Only downside is with all the space and empty jetways and stands why oh why bus people to the plane? With the hot seats you get to board first but boarding the bus first does not help as its still scramble on the plane. 2nd leg to Phuket again easy check in had 'normal' seats on plane and leg room is ok but I am not the tallest guy. I think if I was taking anything longer than 2 hours I would pay for the exit row. 3rd leg Phuket airport showing its age and in dire need of a revamp. but again no issues with TAA on arrival used jet way and bags arrived quickly.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,Jakarta - Singapore on Friday on the 17.30 using the Red Carpet service was an enjoyable experience. Check-in was prompt and efficient and the lounge used basic but comfortable. One issue is that I had to pay for a beer which was poor as it's included in KL. A very efficient member of staff took my passport away and processed it with immigration which was good. I was accompanied through to the Departure Lounge and even accompanied across the tarmac before everyone else. Aircraft clean and comfortable and cabin crew very professional. Visited Air Asia in Changi re. complaint from my SIN-CGK flight in Red Carpet without lounge access offered in Changi - it'll be interesting to see if I ever get a reply or refund!
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,,"I am en route back from Singapore to Phnom Penh with Air Asia after learning much to my disgust what Air Asia means by ""point to point"" service. I flew from Yangon to Singapore and expected - to be able to get a boarding pass from Yangon to Singapore and check my bags through. I am an experienced traveler and fly constantly. When I landed in KL I was to my surprise required to go through immigration and customs in Kuala Lumpur pick up my bag check through the confusing Air Asia terminal recheck my bags and then go through the whole process to get on to Singapore. As I had bought a ticket from Singapore to Phnom Penh with only 90 minutes between flights - plenty of time for a normal carrier not for Air Asia's bizarre system - I had to change my return flight pay them $55 USD for the pleasure of spending 4 hours in the horrible Air Asia Terminal. They impose a huge burden on customers doing this. The Air Asia web site is excellent - and if they wanted the could easily alert customers that 90 minutes is not enough time to go through their transfer system but of course they do not. Don't fall for it."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,"My experience has been very negative flying with them. I flew with them last weekend from Phuket to Jakarta and the flight was 6 hours delayed. Absolutely no compensation provided. Our flight was changed from 7.30pm to 1.30am so we eventually arrived at 3.30am. No apologies or explanation given by the airline either. On top of this we paid for a ""hot seat"" which was uncomfortable and didn't recline. Never flying with them again. The food choices were also really bad. Many things were missing from the menu as they ""ran out""."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,no,2,In the last month my husband and I went on 4 Air Asia flights. It was a mixed experience. The inflight entertainment is very limited. Whilst some of the service was good and they were generally courteous there were inconsistencies across the board. We paid for an inflight entertainment package on our last flight but did not receive it. But on one of our flights we scored a deal where we were able to upgrade to premium which was much better and the service was more frequent but still very patchy. An experience which has really left a very poor taste in my mouth was having a check in lady be very rude and abrupt with my husband.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,,4,yes,8,I flew from Singapore to Jakarta on May 14th and opted for the Red Carpet Service paying S$55 for the extra service. I thought check in was efficient but it turns out I should have been given lounge access but this didn't happen so I bought breakfast. I guess the priority boarding was good but I'd had to pay extra for my seat allocation as well. The flight was good with friendly and helpful crew and regular updates from the flight deck. I'm flying back to Singapore on May 22nd from Jakarta and look forward to a good flight in seat 1A.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,,,2,no,,I used Air Asia to fly back to Australia from Vietnam where I now live. On the KL to Gold Coast leg I went to buy a meal using Vietnam Dong and was refused service as they don't accept this currency. They also would not accept a credit card! Hence I was looking at an 8 hour flight with no food or water. It took a lot of complaining for the staff to give me a single 250 ml bottle of water to last me the entire flight! I had to get to talk to the head steward as the others simply walked away from me and refused to offer anything whatsoever. The cabin crew completely ignored me after that and could not have cared less about my situation. I will never use this carrier again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,DPS-SIN. Efficient check in and boarding. Flight left on time and seat was comfortable. Food was tasty and cheap (bought on line before). Overall a great experience and everything that you could ask for from a low cost airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,,5,yes,8,Clark-KUL economy. Flight according to schedule. On time. No fuss. Good leg room. Hard working kind and pleasant staff. Will fly with AA again - much better than other budget airlines I have flown with and great value for money.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,4,no,2,"KUL-SGN. Lovely looking stewardesses and new aircraft. Reasonably comfortable seats even for my 6ft 2"" 18 stone frame. But check in immigration departure lounge baggage reclaim? Just prepare to be treated third class and expect to be herded like cattle. They certainly bring a whole new level to ""no frills airlines"". Cheap and great for hopping around South East Asia truly the Greyhound in the skies."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,5,yes,8,PEN-SIN. Short flight from Penang to Singapore. A320 aircraft looked fairly new in good clean condition. Buy on board service was efficient and well priced. Arrived on time. No issues would defiantly fly with the again especially for the bargain prices that they offer.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,,5,yes,9,Nov 2012 SYD-CLARK PH. Plane was new and clean and we left on time. Service was excellent and the food was well priced and good quality. Aisles are narrow and seats not made for anyone above average size. Plane arrived on time. No entertainment but was great value for the money.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,3,yes,8,I was on CGK-SUB vv flight (QZ 7680 on Mar 17 and QZ 7685 on Mar 19). They were pretty much on schedule. Everything in general was good. The airline has revised the boarding procedure by managing the boarding passengers. Good strategy to minimize the ground time and maintain the on time performance although a bit inconvenient to the passengers.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,,,0,no,2,"Melbourne - Chiang Mai return. Plane was a little late leaving Chiang Mai and due to ""congestion"" our plane landed at the international airport - presumably not carrying enough fuel to wait for a landing slot. Passengers not informed of what was happening and many missing connecting flights. Arrived at Air Asia terminal over 3 hours late. The Air Asia staff were if not rude then uncaring. About 20 people eventually marched through immigration and customs to a grotty corner of the airport - the desk for wheelchair service. Over 2 hours to rebook everyone using one computer terminal and entering computer codes manually. No food offered and no information given. Eventually ended up in a backpacker standard hotel - no towels in room no drinking water. To bed at 2am no food. Minimal breakfast in hotel but no lunch offered even though our substitute flight was 1.45pm. Low budget should not mean such rubbish service when the airline is at fault."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,I have taken 2 trips to Phuket in the last 6 months flying AirAsia from the Gold Coast I found them to be an excellent airline they always left on time and arrived on or before the advertised arrival time the cabin crew are great and the food was not bad either the in flight entertainment was ok. They had the shortest travel times from all the airlines that fly to Phuket and the best prices.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,,,2,no,2,Flew from Cochin to KL to Incheon. If you are taller than 180cm there will be not be enough room for your legs. They will push up against the seat in front and you will constantly get bumped if you're sitting in the aisle. Having to wait at LCCT is an awful experience. The public address system announcing the flights is ridiculously loud and the static is so bad that it's impossible to understand anything being announced. While boarding the crew insist on blasting cheesy rock music regardless of the time. The vegetarian food is over- priced for the small serving I received. The amount of money saved is minimal after adding up all of the extra costs.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,8,My first domestic trip CNX-DMK return. Was pleased to see what they had done with DMK. Disappointed that we were bussed to terminal but as it dropped us off nearer baggage area without walking far we shouldn't grumble. Efficient boarding at both ends meant early arrival on both sectors. Had the pancake combo for breakfast. Surprised that the drink offered was water and not coffee. I only used them as a friend arrived at DMK also with Air Asia. Price was almost same as Bangkok Airways to BKK and will continue to use them if flying to BKK and beyond. But TAA and DMK is an attractive alternative if just flying to BKK.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,4,yes,9,PEN-SIN on a very new A320. Pre selected seat in the first row (1D) as I wanted to have a fast clearance out of Changi Airport. Aircraft was pushed back 10 minutes before ETD and arrived SIN 20 mins earlier than ETA. Efficient cabin crew.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,3,no,7,I have been flying with my wife who has problems walking and needs a wheelchair from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur and return. Flights were on time with nothing adverse to report and a very friendly crew. What is annoying is the way AirAsia are managing to increase prices: additional fee for credit card payment additional fee for seats (I can agree to a supplement for seats with more legroom) but to have to pay an extra fee for any seat is something than even Ryanair has not (yet) considered how can you fly without a seat? Additional fee for wheelchair use (4 USD it means 16 USD for a return trip). If you consider all this the price is not too different from what you can get on regular airlines and this will be my choice next time.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,7,Flew BKK to Singapore with Thai Air Asia. Another bus to the plane. Lot's of empty stands but I think the Airbus and stand do not match. They boarded the bus by row numbers but this soon turned into a free for all. Staff friendly and the normal service standards of a budget airline. Couldn't beat the price compared to the full service airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2,no,3,Flight AK1441 from Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur. Booking and flight document indicated departure of 21.00 Vietnam time and arrival 23.15pm Malaysia time with no delay in departure time. Arrived Kuala Lumpur at 01.15 (the next day) without any transit only to find out later that an added 2hrs flight is due to inconsistency in flight details generated by airline's system against actual flight duration. Ample of residual consequences including airport pickup charter and hotel booking arising with the timing mistake made by the airline's system.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,5,yes,9,Traveled to Denpasar Bali on Dec 2013. Had no issue with the QZ flight the ground staff and flight crew in KUL were attentive and nice. However for the return flight the ground staff in Bali didn't even bother to explain to us regarding the flight delay it was delayed over 3 hours. No refreshments at all. Just an announcement regarding the gate change. I've had delayed flights with AA while in KUL they provided us info on why the aircraft was late even meal vouchers and food but not in Bali. Very disappointing!
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew from Don Muang Bangkok to Jakarta. Planes clean and new flights were on time crew indifferent seats narrow. However considering the price a very good alternative especially in Bangkok where you can enjoy the now (almost) empty Don Muang Airport with no queues at the immigration and fast luggage deliveries.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,3,no,1,Flew from SYD-KUL return. Was quite happy with them on the first leg apart from the poor airport at LCCT on the return leg they changed the rules for cabin baggage denying both of us a second carrier bag allowed onboard. Very disappointing and rude ground staff. Very poor organisation. On the same flight staff failed to secure toilet doors before takeoff so they swung open abruptly. I'd avoid flying them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew from Sydney to Penang via KL then Penang to KL KL to Miri Miri to Kuching Kuching to KL and then on to Singapore. Both ground and air crews were excellent extremely helpful and kind with our elderly parents with mobility issues. Check in at all airports was quick and efficient. Arrival at KL LCCT was a shock did not expect to have to walk the long distance from the tarmac to the terminal building in the hot blazing sun. Most airports would have a bus to transport the passengers to the terminal building. Not a good first impression of KL. Will certainly fly AirAsia again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,,4,yes,7,Bangkok to Singapore on 30/1/13. Easy check in at Don Muang airport and was given an aisle seat as requested. Friendly airline staff and a good selection of food on sale. A little different to the grumpy lot on my next flight on Qantas from Singapore to Sydney.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,Recently flew return from Bangkok Don Muang to Chiang Mai. Check-in was very good at both airports both flights were on time nice clean aircraft and first rate cabin crew.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,,,4,yes,9,DMK-DMK and DMK-KBV return on A320. Check in was quick. Flights on time. Seats comfortable and decent legspace. Crew attentive and polite. Food was decent. Luggage arrived promptly. Did miss that you could not buy a beer.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,9,When 4 of us were flying from BKK-KUL on 15 Dec there was a 2 hrs delay and we missed our connecting flight to Kuching. All flights to East Malaysia were fully booked to an extend where no standby passengers were allowed. We tried to check with all other airlines none were available. When I presented my case to AirAsia counter at LCCT somehow the counter staff was able to fly us home. We appreciated their effort to make our travel comfortable even in a 'hopeless' situation. Most recently when AirAsia halted their KL/CMB/KL flights 14 of us were affected from 27 Feb to 5 Mar. Refund was fast even our connecting flights were refunded. Value for money. In terms of comfort services and planes are good. LCCT is sometimes below par especially the female washrooms - wet and smelly! Hopefully the new KLIA 2 will be a better terminal.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,,4,yes,6,The last time I flew Air Asia was when I returned back from Medan to Surabaya. It was a very long flight for an Indonesian domestic flight. More than 3 hours. It supposed to be a good flight but due to a delay my flight departed in the evening and I was devoid of scenery as it was dark. Seat pitch was not great for a flight longer than one hour. I had a mixed feeling over the food. The fried rice was terrible but the satay was great.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,,,2,no,,I am unhappy that Air Asia's transfer to Don Muang airport has not improved any of their problems they had when they used to fly from Bangkok's main airport at Suvanabumhi. The delays are the same - from the check in counters to the flight departures. Last week I waited 1 hour in the check in line - unacceptable when they are only 1 of 3 small airlines using this airport. Then you have to take a bus from the check in gate to where the plane is located almost a kilometre away on the tarmac. Changing from Bangkok's main airport was supposed to improve all these things. Also transferring from Don Muang to Survanabumhi (where all the other airlines leave from) takes a long taxi ride of around 600 baht (incl. 3 tolls). It is just not worth using Air Asia in Thailand at all! Their website often goes down during your flight booking and there is never any response when you make a customer complaint. This airline makes changes to suit itself and save money but never makes changes for its customers.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Numerous flights REP-KUL KUL-HKT HKT-KUL KUL-SGN. Experiences differ at each airport but check-in and boarding was smooth. Nice leather seats and although not a lot not bare minimum legroom. Good selection of food and drink (which was very cheap). The satay chicken was quite oily however the tandoori chicken wraps were nice. Every flight was on-time if not early. The Kuala Lumpur LCCT is a bit old and grubby but then again you do have to expect that when travelling low-cost.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,4,yes,9,Gold Coast to Colombo Sri-Lanka Via Kuala Lumpur. Flight was good and food tasted alright. We had no problems with baggage and staff were not all that bad. I didn't like the fact that you had to pay extra for in- flight entertainment and had no screen on the back of the seat in front of you but that is common with most budget airlines. I would certainly recommend Air Asia just remember you get what you pay for.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,,,4,yes,9,I've flown with Air Asia often last time at NYE next time 19th January. Flights are usually on time some delays of 30 mins sometimes but never had my flight cancelled. The attendants are friendly and the aircraft is clean. If you manage to plan ahead you can get really good promotions. Overall good service mainly considering you are flying a low budget airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Bangkok to Yangon Yangon to KUL and KUL to Bangalore. Flights left slightly late. Food available on board was reasonably priced and good quality. However I was intrigued that each time we weighed in our bags on the Air Asia scales they were 1kg to 1.5 kg heavier than on Qantas or Thai scales - and we had exactly the same contents in them. I also noticed that the crew paid scant attention to young children who did not have seat belts on.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew with 2 others from KUL-PEN on 1/1/2013. Bought the Red Carpet service which was made the whole experience really good from check in to baggage claim. We got the seats we asked for (front row) and were very comfortable for the short flight. Friendly cabin crew. No complains at all about the flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,5,yes,7,Melbourne to Singapore with a stopover in KUL. Plane was clean with comfortable lighting. The seat's pitch is not a problem but the issue lies with the amount of shoulder space between passengers. There is just not enough space if you have broad shoulders. The seats are comfortable for smaller builds only. I had to lean on one side throughout my 8 hour flight. The poor quality padding starts to present itself about 2 hours into flight. The toilets are very clean. The sandwich taste good on both legs. The attendants are friendly but firm. I can see why it is the best low cost airline because it does offer the best value. I personally would prefer more space on long haul flights. Again what you pay is what you get.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,4,yes,9,I have flown with AA numerous times over the past 5 years both internationally and domestically and as with every thing 'always read the fine print' and you will have no problems (you have to check the box to verify that when you purchase your ticket). You get what you pays for and Air Asia overall do precisely that with a minimum of fuss and bother.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,Langkawi-KUL economy class. Seamless online check in same at airport bag drop. On time departure (in fact a couple of minutes early) and spot on time arrival in KUL. Fully loaded aircraft with lots of large family groups typical for the time end of April. Meal was very good. Staff on board very professional without being overly friendly. Seats are a normal. The aisles were like a busy thoroughfare all flight. All in all a perfect flight when taking prices etc into consideration.
,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,Following the below review of our trip from Tokyo-Sapporo the return flight Sapporo-Tokyo was cancelled leaving us with the option of travelling the following day or getting a refund. To give a refund is to shirk responsibility. Anyway I suppose low-cost travel is fine provided nothing goes wrong. If it does you're completely stuck at a foreign airport. Overall the cheap experience from beginning to end is probably not worth it unless you're desperate to save $50 on the ticket price at the purchase stage. We will certainly not be using low-cost air travel again if it can possibly be helped.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,,,3,no,5,Bandung to Pekanbaru on 9th December. At the time I bought the tickets scheduled for 3.40 pm but 3 days prior to departure the schedule suddenly changed to 5.35 am. A very disappointing change.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,4,We travelled from Tokyo Narita to Sapporo-Chitose on 22 Dec. Air Asia is the usual low-cost routine - a separate terminal with no facilities bus out to the plane at the far end of the airport tight seating and generally a joyless experience. Since when did air travel become so bland and so unexciting? Our biggest disappointment was the Air Asia terminal/departure lounge at Narita airport. Once you enter after check-in you cannot leave and there are no facilities except a toilet and a small shop. We felt trapped and stuck there in a facility that resembles a hospital waiting room. This in a busy and interesting airport with an array of shops cafes etc but we were stuck in this waiting room with no forewarning and no way to leave. Anyone checking in 3 hours in advance as requested would be well advised to time it to the last minute before going through security as this departure lounge is a horrid experience. I would also add looking at the ticket prices which creep ever upwards that the only thing cheap about low-cost travel nowadays is the way you feel after using it.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,3,no,,Our flight was diverted on the way to Phuket and we were dumped in Bangkok at midnight with no information let alone a hotel. Over 200 passengers were forced to fight for 8 available hotel rooms that they had to pay for themselves. After over a 12 hour wait the flight then boarded again but was then further delayed as they had messed up the luggage getting to the plane. It ended up with bags on the tarmac and passengers pointing out the windows to their bags. The staff were downright rude and refused to even provide a drink.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,,,5,yes,9,Sydney-KUL economy class. Seamless online check in same at airport bag drop. Seats 25 over wing. On time departure (in fact a couple of minutes early) and spot on time arrival in KL. Fully loaded aircraft with lots of large family groups typical for Christmas Day. Meal was ok - probably would have been nicer if it was hotter. Staff onboard very professional without being overly friendly. Seats are a touch narrow and sitting on the aisle I was continually bumped. The aisles were like a busy thoroughfare all flight. All in all a perfect flight when taking prices etc into consideration.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,,,1,no,,Booked a return flight from Bangkok to Krabi with my wife. She was 27 weeks pregnant and we confirmed with Air Asia before flying that nothing special was required. We flew to Krabi and all was perfect. On the way back we were seated onboard for 5 minutes when a crew member asked us to leave the plane as we did not have any authorization to fly. We were left at 8.30pm in the empty airport with no solution for us to go back home. Luckily we could take a Thai Airways flight home.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,5,yes,8,Having flown Air Asia X and the domestic service on numerous occasions I have only experienced one glitch. On a return flight from Kuching to KUL the incoming flight to Kuching was almost 3.5 hours late. No explanation was offered. As a consequence I failed to catch a connecting flight from KL to Penang. The counter staff at LCCT were helpful and reissued my ticket. The only problem was that this was the last flight to Penang that evening. It was a very long day! Providing you leave 3 to 4 hours leeway if you have another flight booked generally AA are pretty good. It is really a question of value for money and AA are exceptional in this respect.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,,,4,yes,8,CGK-DPS (Dec 9) and DPS-CGK (Dec 12) flight. The first stint was on time but the later one about 10 minutes delayed although eventually we arrived only 5 minutes late. Everything in general very good.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,3,no,5,Travelled in a group of 40 KUL-CNX on 29/11/2012. Upon arrival to LCCT the crowd at LCCT was horrendous especially during holiday season. However we managed to check in our luggage within an hour thanks to efficient ground staff who was at the counter alone. CNX-KUL on 2/12/2012. Chiang Mai airport was much more less crowded early in the morning it was only AK flight at that time but were surprised that the check in procedure took more than an hour! There were one lady at front counter one at the back helping to cut the e-boarding pass and stick the stickers to the check in luggage. We should have been checked in as a group and not 2 by 2! My question is what if there are 3-4 groups checking in simultaneously? Some could miss the flight?
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,4,yes,5,"Phuket-Chiang Mai Economy. Air Asia is riding the budget airline wave and doing a reasonable job of it. We ordered some food when we booked (Pancakes and Satay) which turned out to be decent. Everything went smoothly and on time. My only grief was how tightly packed the seats are onboard. I'm 6'1"" and used to being a bit squished on airlines. These seats were the worst I'd ever been on without question. In our case the flight was a little over an hour and we had the row to ourselves to spread out. I would never book this airline for longer legs with more passengers."
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,We flew from Kuala Lumpur to Vientiane and back and found Air Asia very good both the ground staff and cabin crew were excellent the aircraft was one of the cleanest I have travelled on and the cost and range of drinks and food were also very good. Outbound flight departed on time and on our return we actually departed a little early. Keeping in mind the low price we paid for tickets for a two and half hour flight Air Asia provided excellent value for money and we would certainly use them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,,2,no,2,Night flight from DMK-KUL last week and the flight was delayed 45 minutes. This week my friends took flight to SIN and CGK (both were from KUL) and both flights were delayed for 45 and 40 minutes. They had to pay midnight charges on their return trip from the airports not to mention the normal hassle when you got delayed.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,5,yes,7,Having found a promotion fare from CNX-MFM I thought I would try the latest destination out of Chiang Mai. I was interested to see why they gave up Singapore in favour of Macau. It quickly became apparent as most of the pax were in a tour group from mainland china. Standard Air Asia service although this time I booked a hotseat and had a nice chicken lasagne. Flight was 30 mins early. No jetway at MFM but the walk in fact makes getting to immigration easier. Next to the airport is a new jetfoil service to Hong Kong.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,4,yes,8,Flights from Pekanbaru to Bandung and otherwise reasonably satisfactory to me. However flight attendants are not very friendly towards passengers. Other than that I think no problems the flight on time.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,3,no,3,"Having checked online for Yangon to Bangkok it just remained to have documents checked at the appropriate desk. 50 minutes later still waiting. They allowed passengers with checked luggage to use the same line and then a tour group had problems with documentation. Instead of asking them to stand aside to fill in the documents they let them block the line. The supervisor said ""you could have joined another line"" - yes at the back again!"
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,,I could not check in online therefore did not know that luggage food and entertainment had to be pre- booked. At the airport we had to pay $240 for luggage because I had not checked in online. This holiday was purchased as a package and the flights were to be with Jetstar. The trip took too long overall with waiting time in airports but the worst part was that on the return the flight was supposed to leave Phuket at 7.30pm and was delayed until 9.30pm. Staff kept assuring us the flight to Australia would wait for us. This did not happen and the plane left before we arrived were put up in sub standard hotel for the night. Quite a long day for a 1.5 hour flight from Phuket. Not acceptable. I also told staff we had a domestic flight booked to Brisbane on the Sunday and they told me it was nothing to do with them.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,Perth to KL and 8 days later back to Perth. We were fortunate to obtain hot seats which proved to be excellent plenty of room. Coming home we changed our flight to travel with friends that left a day earlier. Changes were made efficiently but we were unable to get hot seats. Pleasantly surprised at the amount of leg room was able to fully stretch my legs under the seat in front with no effort. Didn't order food. We found staff to be pleasant efficient and I would not hesitate to book Air Asia again. The only thing I would make sure next time that I had a laptop to watch movies. Excellent flight and landed 20 minutes early.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,2,no,,Sydney to Kuala Lumpur then onto Phuket. Trip over went ok return trip was a disaster. I received a notification from the airline that there would be a delay at Kuala Lumpur I tried to get a later flight from Phuket to no avail. On arrival at Kuala Lumpur the transfer desk had one employee there so 1.5 hrs in a queue then immigration another 1 hr in a queue then a 10 hr delay at the airport. No explanation no apologies just a voucher for a hamburger. Never Again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,2,no,,Seoul to Indonesia. My flight plan was supposed to be Seoul - Kuala Lumpur and Kuala Lumpur - Jakarta. The 2nd flight was delayed 2hrs and I missed my connecting flight in Jakarta because of that. Customer service agents didn't do anything except proposing I take the next flight (would get me stuck in Jakarta) or buy another flight ticket to my final destination. I choose the 2nd solution but didn't arrive at my final destination and lost over 200€ in the end.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,,4,yes,8,Bangkok-Phuket one-way economy Oct 2012. Price was a little more than I expected (about US$120) but online booking payment and seat selection was very easy. Flight departed on time and cabin crew seemed very determined to get everyone to destination as quickly and comfortably as possible. You pay for everything including water but food and drinks prices were very low. Seats reasonably comfortable. Overall satisfactory flight and I would fly them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,7,KUL-LOP-KUL in October 2012. My first trip to Lombok Indonesia. Took advantage of the launch fares (RM 88) and can't complain about the price for a 3 hour 1200+ mile flight. LCCT was its usual mess but I have worked out my standard operating procedure so that I got to the departure hall in good time. Lombok international airport was a little better for departure but arrival hall clearance was slow. The flights were on time and uneventful. Typical AirAsia (AK) service.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,4,yes,8,CNX-KUL. Arrived at airport about 30 minutes before scheduled departure time only to find that checkin stops 45 minutes before and the automatic check in machine was programmed not to check me in as I was deemed late. I checked in at the desk without any problem without checked bags. Plane was late inbound but we made up the time on the flight south. Standard AirAsia service with reasonable cabin crew. Not their latest aircraft but interior in good condition. I was lucky to be off the aircraft quickly as the skies opened and there was a short sharp downpour and anyone from the rear of the plane would have been a drowned rat as there is no jetway from AirAsia flights.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,,,1,no,1,3 hours delay on the flight Jakarta-Singapore. No information about what is going on delaying every half an hour. Horrible customer attention Service is awful.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,,,3,yes,6,"The check-in at KLIA LCCT was chaotic. I took the 10pm flight from KUL to PEN on 27th August (after a very good flight on AirAsia Premium from SYD). I was already web-checked in with pre-paid luggage. The main check-in sign-board directed me to R52 - but when I arrived there it was closed even though I was exactly 2 hours ahead of departure time. Every queue was choked with people. I could not see any sign on the LCD screens for baggage drop-off. Every queue had the sign ""Excess Baggage Payment"" both on the board and at the start of the queue. I approached an usher who asked ""What time is your flight?"". She did not ask me ""Have you web-checked-in?"" and ""Do you have excess baggage?"". After about 1 hour I got to the front of the queue and dropped off my bags. After that I found out that I had been sent to the wrong queue. The was a queue for express luggage posted with a waist-high sign that had been hidden by all the queuing passengers. AirAsia is a real mess at LCCT. I have taken more than 50 AA flights including KUL PEN JHB SIN. KUL LCCT is shameful a disappointment to what is otherwise a great Low-Cost Airline."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,,5,yes,8,We flew BLR-KUL-CLARK in July-Aug and were pleasantly surprised at the level of service offered by AirAsia. We went in fearing worst after reading reviews about the airline and also about the LCCT in KL. However we came back fully satisfied with AirAsia's service and the amenities offered at LCCT. You really cannot expect more for the fares on offer and it wasn't as if there was a dearth of choices. Both airline and terminals were perfectly serviceable. My only suggestion to AirAsia would be to offer at least one vegetarian food choice on non-India routes.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,,,5,yes,7,Flew SYD/KUL and the KUL/PHUKET return. All flights on time web check in was good and saved long queues at the airport easily checked bags in at Sydney that were checked all the way through. No food or entertainment this was expected so was not a problem. Travelled with our 4 kids ensured they had colouring in books iPods etc. Flight was fine at the end of 9 hrs flying they were ready to get off but behaved well without normal flight gadgets. Also took my own food on board was not stopped and didn't have a problem. Staff not very friendly and don't bother you at all. Overnight flight home tried for Premium upgrade was not successful very difficult to sleep although the flight did seem quicker at night. Would recommend as long as you realise it is a budget airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,9,BKK-KUL BKK-HKT (two times) BKK-URT-BKK BKK-CEI-BKK. Flight was nice cabin crew helpful and responsible price cheap compared to other airlines. I would recommend them.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,3,yes,6,BLR-KUL-REP. The seats are tight. If you are tall you're going to have a problem. On the short haul flights from KUL-REP it didn't bother me but from BLR-KUL which was little more than 4 hours being cramped was a bit of a problem. Make sure you weigh your bags before check-in. At the last minute I bought something which put my bag over by 5 lbs. I ended up paying close to $75 in excess baggage about the price of the ticket for going from KUL to REP. I learned you could pay before hand online for excess baggage and its more than 50% less than paying at the airport. Overall I didn't mind Air Asia for short haul flights - under 3 hours but will definitely fly a full price airline for anything long haul. I should also add that their set up at LCCT in KUL was a mess and their ground staff wasn't very friendly.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,4,yes,7,Jakarta to Singapore (QZ7782) and back (QZ7789) on the same day. No delays. The right Low Cost Carrier experience: no frills no food no leg room efficient.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,,,4,no,5,Singapore - Miri Miri - KUL. Cabin staff were more interested in themselves and each other than actually doing anything vaguely like serving passengers. A smile from half way across the cabin isn't service it is nice but that is all. The only good thing about AirAsia is the price. There was not even cabin staff ensuring passengers stored their bags for take off and landing properly.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,no,2,I was going from Chiang Mai to Bangkok and had a connecting flight from there to Copenhagen. I had nearly 6 hours to reach the connecting flight. Less than a week before going they cancelled the flight and rebooked me in a new one nearly 3 hours later. However this flight was delayed and I was too late to reach my flight. That meant I had to pay for rebooking and stay nearly 24 hours in the airport. I made a complaint to Air Asia but they would not pay because the delay was less than 2 hours. They could not see it as their problem that I was delayed more than 4 hours because of the rescheduling.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,,4,yes,7,PEN-SIN. Check-in was quick as I did not have luggage and boarding was on time. Departed 10 minutes earlier and arrived 15 minutes before schedule. Flight was good and flight attendants were polite but seemed tired as this was the last flight of the day. The only thing I find annoying is that you cannot change your ticket if your flight leaves within 48 hours. Otherwise Air Asia provide a good service which is better than some other airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,3,no,3,"I have flown Air Asia 8 times between CGK-SIN-CGK I have been on-time once. Regardless of price this is unacceptable. Each delay has been from 30 minutes to 3 hours and this is with good weather. I always pick a hot seat exit row. The pitch is fine but it's still tight. Crew's for the most part are friendly. They seem to be getting the Lion air attitude. ""Yea were late so what"". Anyway I'm heading back to Singapore Airlines. Yes it's more money but the delays are out of control at Air Asia."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,Flew from Bangkok (BKK) to Jakarta (CGK) on 27th June this year 2012. Paid for the trip by credit card now you have pay for the processing of the transaction. Every small thing is an extra now! The check in was fine but that was where it went downhill. Got to the gate 30 mins before boarding time and waited and waited the incoming aircraft had not even arrived yet. After another hour still no aircraft. What was totally unacceptable was the fact there was no announcement and no-one seemed to know what was happening I even suggested they call flight operations but they didn't. The flight eventually took off almost 2 hours late. Even though I had paid for a 'hot seat' the pitch is far from adequate and it wouldn't recline. Air Asia when they first started out were a good low cost airline and value for money but they have declined dramatically the prices have gone up and everything connected with the airline has gone down. I won't fly with them again!
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,no,5,Flight from KUL-HAN was on time. The check in was smooth through until boarding. Aircraft's parked far away from our boarding gate. We walked more than 300 metres. Seat comfort and leg room are extremely poor. Staff were nice. However on our return trip from Hanoi a male crew was standing like a poster man. Neither instructed to ease the boarding flow nor helping a nanny who was holding her grandson to stow her hand luggage. Low cost airline shouldn't mean low cost in assisting passengers who need help.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,9,Singapore to Kuala Lumpur: flight on time fast boarding and very attentive staff. Great value for money. Just a little negative note about the low cost terminal in Kuala Lumpur: you have to walk a lot to reach the terminal the hot weather makes it more difficult together with the engine noises and the smell of fuel. Anyway I would fly again with Air Asia.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,The joy that was AirAsia 10 years ago when I started flying with them is no more! On my last flight the problems were so bad I'm convinced this is no longer the way for me to fly even if its on a budget airline. I've already checked in and only needed to arrive early at the airport and then drop my luggage. Unfortunately for me the AirAsia check in system was down. This resulted in very long queues and after 40 long and uncomfortable minutes they resorted to manually check-in passengers and their luggage. While all that is happening they constantly announced about the failure and asked for patience but they continued calling passengers to board flights as if everything else is working. By the time I heard the boarding announcement for my flight we were still hopelessly stuck in the queue. When I approached a ground staff I was horrified to find out that the flight was to take off as scheduled! After at least 1 hour+ of delays thanks to their own check in system's outage I had to remind AirAsia's ground staff that we weren't late because of our own doing. Finally after some frantic phone calls and after realizing at least 50% of the flight passengers are still stuck in queues waiting to check in or to drop their luggage they agreed to delay the flight by 1 hour. Also if you have to board or disembark in KL's LCCT terminal when it's raining I think you will feel very differently about AirAsia - the experience is nothing short of horrible for passengers.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew from Singapore to KL. Great flight aircraft was clean and very comfortable. Plane left on time and arrived early at destination. Flight crew was very pleasant and helpful. I was very happy with the flight and had a great experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,Flight from SUB-BKK-HKT-BKK and KUL-SUB. The service was very bad and the crew very rude. I flew to Bangkok and then Phuket and always got a seat that couldn't recline because the button was broken seat pitch was also very bad. The Low cost carrier Terminal in Kuala Lumpur was very bad ground crew very rude to passengers. Don't use this airline you'll be very disappointed with its service crew and much more.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,3,no,2,We flew from SGN-BKK return in June 2012. I flew Air Asia ten years ago and found it was a fun inexpensive airline. How things have changed! It seems Air Asia is now all about squeezing as much money as possible out of the unsuspecting passenger. I can understand budget airlines charging more for the extra space of exit row seats but to charge you $11 extra because you have a medical condition that requires an aisle seat so you can walk during the flight or the same treatment to a passenger with motion-sickness being denied a window seat is a blatant rip-off. Your seat is selected randomly by a computer and if you don't like it then you pay $11 to change it. In Bangkok I tried to call Air Asia’s office 3 times but each call dropped out while I was waiting to speak to someone. The old 10kg baggage allowance has been reduced to 7 kg. (My carry-on wheeled backpack weighs 3kg) so that means I can pack not much more than my toiletries bag and a change of underwear before I exceed the weight limit. If you book on-line checked baggage fees and insurance are added unless you “uncheck” them. Boarding in BKK was a case of “first rush first aboard”. The flight itself was fine but the entire Air Asia experience leaves a lot to be desired.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,SUB-BKK then BKK-HKT-BKK and last KUL-SUB. The crew was impolite and unfriendly. When onboard from SUB to BKK and KUL to SUB I always found that my seat couldn't recline because the button had broken the seat pitch also unacceptable. When I was in the LCC terminal the ground crew were impolite and not responsive. This airline may be value for money but if you have heavy luggage this airline is not for you. AirAsia really disappointed me.
