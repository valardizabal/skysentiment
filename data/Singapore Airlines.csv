Not Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Singapore,August 2024,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1,no,3,"  I have flown SQ for years and also reached Solitaire status with them for the last few years. Generally, I have always been happy with their service until I encountered a problem. My recent experience with them on a flight from Sydney to Singapore was more than disappointing. The flight was supposed to leave at 11:00 am. However, when I arrived at the airport at 9:00 am I was told that there might be some delays due to technical problems. When I finished immigration and security, I was made aware that the flight was delayed to after 6:00 pm. No one from Singapore Airlines was available to talk to as I was looking to leave the airport and go back to the city instead of waiting the whole day at the airport. Unfortunately, the lounge was also closed due to renovation works. Luckily, we could use the Air New Zealand Lounge and employees there kept promising us that a SQ staff would come and talk to us in 10-15 minutes. In any way, they said that there will be an announcement when the SQ staff would arrive. Well, the staff never showed up until a couple of hours later and there was also never an announcement. Since SQ also just sent one rep, the queue was quite massive. While waiting in the queue a rep called me (I assume that happened because of my high tier status) and offered that I could rebook to the 3 pm flight but they would need to downgrade me to economy class. After asking them about the fare difference, they confirmed that the far difference will be compensated in cash later. I therefore accepted the rebooking. At the time when I was boarding the plane and they were scanning my ticket, they were suddenly asking me to sign a letter. After asking about the content of the letter, they told me that they would compensate me $400 but I would drop any further claims. I told them that I would not sign a letter I have never read while a queue is standing behind me and proceeded to board the plane. Since, I have not heard from them since that day, I was following up on my compensation. Their response is that they are unable to compensate me and said they would give me 20,000 KrisFlyer miles instead.  I did enjoy flying with SQ in the past and their cabin crew is second to none. However, dealing with SQ corporate when there is a problem is something I would like to avoid in the future. So I have decided to change airlines once i used all my miles."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo to Gatwick via Singapore,August 2024,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,4,yes,6,"   My flight from London to Singapore on the 18th was delayed by about an hour. I was worried about making my connection to Tokyo and asked the cabin crew how best to proceed when I arrived in Singapore. They told me not to worry as ground staff would be there to assist. When I arrived in Singapore, the only assistance was ground staff saying 'Tokyo flight that way' and pointing. I ended up having to sprint through the airport (a very long way) and only just made my connecting flight.  Either ground staff should have said that it was not possible to make the flight or they should have had transportation ready to get me to the gate quickly. Singapore Airlines made no effort to help me make the tight connection. As it was, my bags were unable to make it. This caused more inconvenience when I landed at Tokyo. Singapore Airlines ground staff were not very helpful. There were people around the baggage carousel to help me arrange delivery of my bags. However, the best that they could do was to offer to deliver the bags in two days. I said to the ground staff that if they couldn't deliver the bags for two days, could they provide me money to buy these essentials. They point-blank refused. I therefore insisted that the bags be delivered sooner. It was a real battle to get this sorted out and took almost an hour. This was after more than 30 hours after leaving my home in the UK. The ground staff seemed to have zero understanding of the fact that I was tired. They also kept offering to deliver the bags at times that I would be at work. It seemed a case of me having to work around their schedule rather than them having to work around mine. This whole lack of consideration for what was convenient for me after having had my bags delayed through no fault of my own, just added insult to injury. The airline also gave me a meal with fish in on the Tokyo to Singapore flight despite the fact that I had ordered a vegetarian meal. They did apologise profusely for this and gave me compensation in the form of a voucher. Singapore Airlines have amazing cabin crew. On all four flights, they went above and beyond to assist and ensure that I had a good journey. However, I feel like the airline is depending upon the excellent service/attitude of the cabin crew and that the rest of the airline's services leave a lot to be desired. The ground staff in particular were extremely unhelpful and seemed like they really were not interested in the customers. The check-in staff at London Gatwick were extremely unfriendly and rude.  I expect good service all round from an airline not just when I am in the air. While I love the in-flight service with Singapore Airlines, I would seriously consider whether to fly with them again due to the very poor service/attitude that the ground staff seem to have. A five-star airline (which has been voted the best airline in the world on several occasions) should have more to offer than simply excellent cabin crew."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-8 Max,Family Leisure,Business Class,Kochi to Singapore ,August 2024,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,1.0,5,yes,7," Family of three travelled from Kochi to Singapore on 15/8/2024. While we arrived at the boarding gate at there was more than 12 wheel chair bound passengers queueing in the Economy Class and Business Class lane. We were waiting in the business class queue to board when the female staff boarded 5 Economy class passengers. When queried she informed us that they are accompanying a passenger on wheel chair, I did not understand the logic in 5 persons helping one passenger on wheel chair. The process was a chaos and mis-managed. We had to wait on the ramp leading to the airplane door for more than 20 minutes. "
Not Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Tokyo Haneda,June 2024,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,3,no,4," One of the worst if not the worst flight on SQ. Boarded last walked to my seat. FA was talking to the passenger seated in front of my seat. She acknowledged me and I sat down. No offer of pre takeoff drinks or hot towel. Same FA came to me and confirmed my meal order and said lunch would be served at 12pm. Flight was a day flight taking off at 9am. After takeoff again no after takeoff drink/nuts offered. Lights dimmed. Lunch was to be served around 1130am. So for 2 1/2 hours I did not see any FAs in the cabin. Nothing offered during that time. This is in Business Class mind you. Lunch service was the usual standard but honestly the crew were mediocre. Not to mention never saw the Inflight Manager the whole flight except just prior to landing. The seat was the regional type and I hate it. It's too cramped and uncomfortable. SQ your service has really gone down the hill. What has happened to the famous ""inflight service even other airlines talk about""? Very sad to see such a great airline before go down the drain."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Haneda via Singapore,July 2024,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,2,no,1," I took a flight from Bangkok to Tokyo via Singapore and was told that one of my luggages could not be placed on the flight from Singapore to Tokyo. The ground staff in Tokyo explained that it was because the flight I chose had a short connection time. No, no, no, this flight was recommended by Singapore Airlines when I made the reservation, rather than my choice. She said the package was late because I chose it? I have never heard such a nonsensical shifting of responsibility before. Moreover, the ground staff explained that Singapore Airlines is not responsible for checked baggage and that this was agreed upon at the time of booking. Well, this is what I call an irresponsible handling. She further explained that the package would not arrive at my place only after 2 days. In Japan, logistics is so advanced that it is normal for a package to arrive on the same day as the shipping date if it is in Tokyo. When I pointed this out, they finally arranged for same day delivery after a 30 minute wait. In other words, it was Singapore Airlines' fault, but they would not make the best arrangements unless we told them. However, the next day I received another call. They don't know why, but I was told that my luggage was not loaded on the scheduled flight at Changi Airport again and did not arrive in Tokyo the next day. Will my package ever be delivered? I have found this company to be mismanaged, irresponsible, and responsible without any shame. Please be careful, everyone."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Dubai via Singapore,November 2024,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  As part of my student privileges I get 1 free change which they caused unnecessary delays of over 2 weeks to help me with. They have been asking personal information and the exact same documents repeatedly with me talking to different representatives over the same thing again and again. They will act like they want to help but will actually provide no transparency and will only waste your time. In fact, their technical team prevented me from logging in to my account and magically on making a complaint and sending them screenshots of reduced fares, they responded and took 2 weeks more to let me login to my account. Their actions need to be reported. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Houston to Jakarta via Manchester / Singapore,July 2024,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2,no,5,"  Singapore Airlines quality has declined significantly over the years. I used to fly regularly but stopped taking it for a while until yesterday on a long haul flight from Houston. Food and beverage - Just above average. Beef bourguignon was overcooked and not tender. Chicken Tikka lacks flavor. Poor wine selection. Only one that was really good was the singaporean crab cake. Premium economy lacks leg room vs others. Pillow case is old and faded in color. Some parts of seat sides not cleaned properly. Entertainment Behind vs others. Live TV doesn’t work. Lacks in brightness and sharpness.  Lack of TV series options. Worst, it was down the whole 24 hrs flight during my wife and kids travel on June 18th. They gave compensation vouchers but only for inflight shopping which lacks necessary / useful items. Wifi onboard while it’s free it lacks the speed. Amenities did not get any. Not even eye mask, tooth brush. Cabin crew no longer the proud “singapore hospitality” it once was. Some friendly and attentive, some others just wanting to get the flight over and go home. One even mistook connecting headphone to headphone jack as phone charging so she forced me to take it off during landing and when she realize she was wrong did not say sorry. During my flight from Houston on July 5th I suddenly received notice that baggage is transferred to another flight. While it’s good they notified early and they delivered to my holiday accommodation, had to wait for 8 hours without clothing and basic necessities and ended up doing last minute shopping. They acted as if it’s a normal situation. No compensation. Punctuality I have to say they still excel in this area (hence the two star). It seems likely that SQ has exercised significant budget cuts post covid to increase profitability. However, price is still high vs others so it’s time to take a reflection."

I just want to commend all the cabin crews on both flights, they are such a dedicated crews and very professional. I ranked them as the best customer service in any airlines that I have flown before. The plane is a bit worn but they have maintained their interior, seats are comfortable, and is spotless. The inflight entertainments needs an upgrade, and meals were a bit degraded from the previous experienced with them, but I truly enjoyed flying with Singapore airlines for their friendly and top of the notch customer service."

Not Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Sydney to London via Singapore,June 2024,,,,,,2.0,1,no,1,"   I had a business flight booked and due to the sad passing of my mother I asked if I could pull the outbound leg forward to tie in with her funeral. Singapore Airlines were very kind and said they would move the flight at no charge to me on compassionate grounds. I was very pleased as had enough going on. When I checked the booking they had not moved to the correct airport. I was then told the move would cost around $2k. I asked where the compassion had gone and a week or so later I took a call from a rep to say they would be refunding the difference. I was happy as felt they had dealt with properly. Later that evening I received an email telling me they were looking into the case, but I said there was no need as I had taken a call to say all ok. Wind forward a few weeks and I have taken numerous calls and emails telling me they are looking into the refund. A few days ago I was told I wouldn’t be refund. I just took that call, and the rep said they wouldn’t refund the money and I could cancel my flight for a refund. As you can imagine, I was more than upset that SA were advising me to cancel my flight for my mother’s funeral for a refund. This is an airline who just announced record profits and prior to this and been a pleasure to fly with. But clearly profits come before passengers now. "

Sadly disappointed, food choice was not available then the offering provided was cold. No drinks offered, seats were stacked so close together to squeeze as many as possible into the available space. Inflight entertainment is really bad. Appears Singapore is trying to extract as much money as possible from its passengers while offering nothing better than budget airlines. Will not fly them again and urge others to look at options."

It is nice, but I’m rather buffaloed you do not check the other slippers, like they have in Business Class. Crew was extremely attentive, and friendly. Champagne served in the plastic glasses. IFE seemed ok, for a short hop. This crew didn’t go around forcing everyone to put there shades down, like previous SQ25 flights had. For dinnner I had the Cantonese Pork, was really good.

✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Rome,April 2024,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,3.0,1,no,1," My recent return flights Singapore to Rome on Singapore Airlines were the worst airline experience I've had in my 50 years of international travel and I paid a premium for it. I booked my flights thinking I would treat myself to a quality experience and also paid over SGD50 to reserve my preferred seats. A longwinded online check in which didn't allow me to select carry on only. I needed the airport check in counter to sort that out. Then I noticed I'm not in my reserved seat, instead I have been seated in one of the worst seats in the plane, opposite the toilets. The flight was late, service was chaotic and I was constantly disturbed by the toilet use. I contacted customer service after the flight. ‘Operational/technical reasons’ were the excuse for my seat change (no change of plane type); no they wouldn't refund the seat reservation fee (they are reviewing but no word for 5 weeks). Also the reserved seat on my return flight was also unavailable (to me) and no, no refund, they would try to find a similar seat. I was passed around a series of CSRs, all of whom were brusque, intransigent and unhelpful. For my return flight, online check in would not let me register my Kris Flyer account because someone at SA had altered my name details. This took over an hour to sort out. In the end I missed the flight because I mistook 12pm for midnight. I contacted SA and was offered a seat on the next flight for SGD1400 'as a courtesy'. Even upset I said no to that. I booked with Gulf Air for SGD700, but I noticed in my searches the flight the CSR had offered, available online for SGD1000. The worst customer service and flight experience I have ever had from an airline that markets itself as offering a premium experience. By all means use SA if it's the cheapest deal, you'll get the same experience as anywhere else. I wouldn't pay a premium to fly with them because you won't get anything for your money. The airline knows how to market itself and maybe at one time, its service was above standard, but no longer. Reviews reveal that quality has tumbled post Covid. Clearly the bean counters have taken over as the airline tries to recoup its losses. In my recent experience, SA has been the rudest, most unhelpful and grudging airline I have ever dealt with and I will be avoiding them in future."

Check in staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. The SilverKris Lounge at T3 was phenomenal with amazing wide selection of food, relaxing ambience and the one thing I love most is the private nap room. I took a shower which they had facilities in the lounge. The T2 SilverKris lounge looked dated and the food presentation could have been better. The overall ambience, furniture and interior of T2 SKL felt that it did not fit the branding of Singapore airlines and it just felt crowded and not luxurious or relaxing at all. Flying back to Singapore I took SQ business class while my parents were in economy. I was very disappointed because since two weeks prior to the flight I was not able to select seats for my parents who wanted to sit as far up in the forward zone so that I can assist them asap when needed. I even tried reaching out to Singapore airlines but to no avail and I felt like they had little to no empathy in understanding the situation. At one point while using the live chat on the SQ app, the representative was sarcastic which made me feel so disgusted. I also understand that Singapore airlines also does allow us to do online check in up to 48hrs prior to departure time but for some reason they were already allocated seats even before the check in time. The SQ app nor the website didn’t allow us to purchase seats for them and this was very disappointing. Nevertheless, the staff at Manila airport T3 were very friendly too and the SilverKris Lounge at Manila could also have a better range of food selection. Majority of the food there were just quick bites and I felt there should have been rice made available at least. The whole boarding process for my flight SQ919 seemed pretty messy with no staff managing the crowd properly as well in which I don’t entirely blame SQ but blame the airport management for it. Overall the onboard experiences were good and catering was not too bad as well. I just don’t wish for anyone to experience what my parents and I experience when it came to selecting / pre purchasing seats prior to the flight, it was truly not great experience but an inconvenience we will never forget."

She also checked in frequently to ensure that all was well. Lawrence, the chief steward, was also very welcoming and friendly, and had an affable presence that made the otherwise long journey comforting. Cheryl and Maria, who served us, never forgot details. While service was interrupted during turbulence, one episode lasting longer than 30 min, they could resume where they left off, not forgetting details or requests. This was such a wonderful set of crew, and our group agreed that SQ long haul I'd indeed a cut above, and a great way to fly. Grateful for the experience.

Later I went to the galley looking for snacks but none were available. However sometime later some two plastic bags of snacks were found by the crew. The toilets in business class were not cleaned and became revolting. The second meal was served 5 hours before our scheduled arrival and 6 hours before our actual arrival. The food was not good. The Malaysian meals I ordered bore little resemblance to that available in Singapore or Malaysia.

I have flown business class with numerous airlines and would rank them below Emirates, Qatar, Korean Air, ANA, Asiana, EVA, Air New Zealand and even below United Polaris. This was a 10-hour flight with lie-flat seats. The seats were not simple to recline and yet the flight attendants were not helpful. On Emirates, Qatar and Air New Zealand, they practically hover over you to make your bed and even tuck you in. Here, they were nowhere to be found, leaving us to fend for ourselves. The food was mediocre, cafeteria quality. The main was lobster thermidor which I special ordered. Maybe it’s not right to expect lobster on a plane ride but it was on the menu and given their rave reviews, I wanted to try it. The lobster was served room temperature and was both too tough and not very tasty, although it was pretty to behold. The wines were very mediocre, like bottles you could pick up at a street corner convenience store. I actually tried small portions of all 3 of their reds and 1 of the whites and was displeased with all of them. Other airlines take pride in their wine selection but these were not palatable. Breakfast was waffles which were soggy in the middle and tough on the edges. Again, like the lobster, perhaps this is probably not a good thing to order on a plane since it’s just reheated from the previous day. Possibly an omelette would have been better. In another example of the disappointing service, twice I had to repeat a drink request—to refill my water bottle. On other airlines, once you put your empty bottle on the side, you don’t even have to ask. They immediately grab it and refill it or get a new one. Twice, I had to ask two times for a refill. My WiFi connection didn’t work despite numerous attempts over the course of the 10-hour flight. I didn’t mind much but those who want this amenity should be forewarned. My final first-world complaint—my suitcase was very late to arrive even though it had clearly identifiable priority tags. Another business class no-no. Listen, these may seem like petty complaints but there is so much competition between airlines, and some are genuinely stellar, time after time. When paying thousands of dollars for a ticket, I think it’s acceptable to expect decent service and products. This was my first experience with Singapore Air and I went out of my way to experience them because of the hoopla. Next time, I will rely on a different airline. I’ll NEVER fly Singapore Air again."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-8 MAX,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Denpasar to Singapore,March 2024,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4,yes,8, This was our first time on a Singapore Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Only 6 of the 10 business class seats were taken and we were seated in the only 2 ‘throne seats’ on this plane. These seats were very comfortable and perfect for a short haul flight. What made this flight exceptional for us were the extremely nice and ultra professional 2 flight attendants that really did their utmost to pamper us and give us an impeccable service. Food and drinks were super despite ‘Book the Cook’ wasn’t available on this flight to SIN. We had a connecting flight from SIN where ‘Book the Cook’ was available but where previously lobster always used to be one of the options to select it now no longer is available. This is really a pity as this was one of our favourites on SQ flights. Perhaps they introduced this as a cost saving but I do not understand why they should do a cost saving while the cost of the already expensive tickets increased almost 50%. Recent flights we took on SQ were also somewhat inconsistent and what makes or breaks a good flight for us is a good crew. Despite the super flight from Denpasar to Singapore we unfortunately had a few flights with SQ where some of the crew members weren’t that professional. We pay a lot of money for a good service so it’s obvious we get the impeccable service we paid for.
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Mumbai via Singapore,November 2023,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,1.0,1,no,1, We fly Singapore Airlines regularly to India since the year 2001 from Melbourne mainly due to their transit time in Singapore. Post-Covid this airline has cut its in-flight service in Economy class. There is no 2nd meal provided in Melbourne to Singapore sector under the pretext of passengers not wanting to eat since it's a midnight departure. They have replaced the 2nd meal which used to be breakfast before the touchdown in Singapore by a puff.  Water is served but the orange & apple juice cups are reduced as well as hot towel service. The check-in is chaotic in Melbourne. Why should we fly Singapore Airlines when Qatar & Emirates offer a superior service than SQ.

Boarding was very well organised in 8 groups, therefore not the usual queues in the aircraft. The economy seat was quite comfortable compared to other airlines and had several stowing pockets. Food was very good and tasty and when i ask for little snack in between they bring me chips, chocolate and a cereal bar. Sandwich was also available. The crew was regular providing juices, water and softdrinks and had a smile on their faces. As a frequent flyer i need to say that was the best economy experience ever and i felt like a valued customer."

Our flight was delayed because of thunderstorms. Consequently we missed our connection in Frankfort for Dublin. I am writing this because I was most impressed with their efficiency in handling redirected flights and accommodation. They looked after us very well and had everything organized for us. Also the staff on both flights were extremely kind and helpful. No wonder Singapore Airlines are voted the best in the world. Well done to everyone concerned.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Kochi to San Francisco via Singapore,January 2024,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Our recent experience has been deeply disappointing. We faced severe disruptions which necessitated rerouting and resulted in significant extra costs and inconveniences. Singapore Airlines failed to reimburse us for necessary ground transportation. We attempted multiple times to resolve this issue amicably, reaching out through the proper channels and  addressing higher management. Each time, our efforts were met with a lack of response or dismissive templated apologies, without any attempt to address the core issues or fulfill promised compensations."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Tokyo,April 2024,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1,no,3,"  Flight SQ636. Our flight to Tokyo was scheduled for 9:50 pm 20/4/24 but the plane only took off at nearly 1 am 21/4/24. The pilot first announced that an Engineer was on his way to check on the plane as there is a technical fault. After about 40 mins, he comes back on to inform that the Engineer is still on the way and that a part in the plane would have to be checked. After another 30 mins or so, the pilot announced that there will be a need to replace a part in the plane with a nearby plane and that they would have to conduct a full shutdown of the power in the plane. We were left in darkness for about 10 mins with no lighting and fresh oxygen. There was more waiting till a further hour before the pilot announced that the part has been replaced and that the plane would take off in 10 mins - that did not happen for about a further 40 mins.  Throughout the entire ordeal, the pilot sounded very cavalier and while he apologised a few times, his tone and voice came across as if it is just a game or that it was no big deal. Why allow us to board when the plane has technical issues? Why isn't there an Engineer on site at Changi Airport SIA is a local airline? Why isn't there ready supply of spare parts that you need to get from another plane?  At the end of the flight, all we got was an email apologising to us for the delay. The least that SIA can do to show that it really takes the sloppiness as a serious quality issue is to give all the passengers gift vouchers or free miles. As an airline that prides itself as a top international airline not only was the flight experience my worst one, but the post-sale experience lacked any sincerity and initiative. "

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Shanghai,August 2023,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Terrible online chat service. I was traveling with my 2 dogs as checked excess baggage and needed to know some information. I knew that the airline allowed dogs to be checked as excess baggage and that they had recently scrapped their policy of allowing dogs in the cabin. However, when I asked my questions regarding traveling with my dogs, the online chat service staff kept coming up with different stories about how pets are banned on Singapore Airlines flights altogether, including in cargo. This person also was not able to answer some basic questions, and was not even fluent in basic English. Attempts to request to be in contact with the staff's manager were in vain as the staff simply ignored my messages. When checking my dogs in, the staff at the counter were confused and did not know how to check my dogs in. They had to call a number of their superiors to assist them with the process and made me wait for a very long time. Today, I contacted them via their online chat service once again to ask a question and all they did was constantly copy and paste the exact same line from one of their web pages which I had already seen and was exactly what I was trying to clarify. Absolutely useless online customer service staff in my opinion. And frankly, there is nothing special or outstanding about this airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Singapore,April 2024,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3,no,5,"  Overall disappointing from Singapore Airlines. Late and disorganized boarding. The A350-900 is a tired old thing. Does anyone seriously use the coat hanger button on the seat back in front of you? This aircraft has no air outlets above seats and made the trip stuffy. The entertainment system was very old and dated movies, yes even the so called “recent releases”. TV selections were abysmal.  This was the first international flight I watched nothing at all on. Food was below par and drinks service patchy. I used to think Singapore Airlines was a great airline but after this flight I beg to differ. One good point is the staff on board professional and friendly."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boring 777,Business,Premium Economy,Zurich to Singapore,April 2024,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,5.0,1,no,6,"  I usually fly Singapore Airlines internationally, since 10 years I am a Krisflyer Gold member. The recent pricing and service changes, show the results of bailed out airlines believing ethical standards don't apply to them anymore. Unbelievably toxic SIA service for business customers. Bear in mind if you fly for business and may have changes you will need 3 days and potentially dozens of phone calls and sessions to even rebook flexi tickets which then costs north of 1000$. This particular flight was booked via our company travel agent, a large international agent. Leaving aside the drop in service quality over years, from discontinuing warm towels to not offering snacks anymore during the flight, what has really infuriated me with SIA are the change policies. On this flight, despite having the highest premium economy booking class (T) with a full flexi ticket, a simple change in flight date cost me >1000$ extra is unexplained fees: In addition to the change in ticket price, which makes no sense on the highest booking class, a rebooking fee, a no show fee , a digital processing fee and the worst 250$ of ""offline"" fee because I used an agent, not their website. While my agent was helpful, SIA straight out refused to talk to them. It took 3 full days and 15 chat sessions to actually get the ticket rebooked for a simple day change on the exact same flight, SIA let them wait 30min per session, as they are only available to agents during Singapore business hours - and if they are closes they simply hang up."

The flight with SQ was just a big hassle all the way through. The night before the BCN departure I was informed via SMS that the flight from BCN to SIN would be delayed by more that 3 hours. That was it. SQ could not have cared less about re-booking the flight proactively so that I would not miss my MLE connection in SIN. I had to call their incompetent customer service in Singapore and fight with them for 2 hours on the phone so that my flight was eventually rebooked via MUC - FOn the re-booked leg they managed to lose my bag in MUC. I did trace the bag with an Apple air tag and it was delivered to SIN the next day. Rather than getting the bag on the next flight to MLE, SQ kept it in SIN for another two days before sending it on to MLE From my experience, SQ is ok as it comes to cabin service (whilst you can see their cost saving actions as well with no more amenity kits in C, cheap wines etc.). However, as it comes to customer service, SQ is absolutely below any standard I have ever seen. In fact they could not care less about their customer - and I am speaking of business class."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Phuket,March 2024,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,no,2,"  Singapore Airlines continues to enjoy a good reputation, however my most recent experience was very poor and fell far short of my expectations. Due to a cancellation by another airline, I needed to modify the departure on my full fare, refundable ticket. I completed the customer assistance form on their website to request the rebooking, and tried repeatedly over an 8 hour period to reach their customer service number in the US. It was impossible to get past the recording and reach an agent over the phone. It was also not possible to make this change myself online. Upon arriving at Changi, I discovered that instead of changing my outbound flight as requested, Singapore Airlines cancelled my entire ticket. When I tried to rebook the flight, there was not a single open seat for the return over a two day period (Easter weekend). Agents at Changi were apologetic and tried to help, but with no seats available, there was little they could do. I have never before been unable to reach an airline representative, and this has certainly not been the case when I have tried multiple channels over an 8 hour time period. I am appalled by the lack of basic customer service extended to a passenger holding a Y fare ticket and Star Alliance Gold status. I would encourage any US-based traveler to avoid Singapore Airlines at all costs until they can bring their customer service up to a minimum level. I will not be flying Singapore Airlines again."

The economy class cabin was in a 3-3-3 configuration and the flight was almost full. What amazed me most was how much food was available for economy passengers - 2 full meals and the rear galley was stocked with snacks. The crew came round regularly with trays of drinks and juice through the flight. I disembarked with a very full stomach! The timing of main meals and the lighting/dimming of the cabin were done sensitively. The cabin crew seemed willing to please, it makes interactions pleasant and the whole experience that bit more enjoyable. Eye-masks were not handed out but were provided upon request.

The left and right armrests effectively reduce the working seat width to 12 inches. The B737 MAX is not fit for purpose for long haul flights and I would recommend that you do fly on this aircraft unless its for a flight duration of no more than 2 hours. Most passengers I spoke to by the end of the flight were also having back aches too. The flight also run out of wine and beer before they had completed serving the lunch so inflight service also very poor indeed.

We had two meals, dinner and breakfast, both meals were ok. I wanted to charge my phone during the flight, usb charger wad not working. I remember many years ago, when travelling with Singapore Airlines, the drink trolley came before the meal, and again when you got the meal, and they showed up again shortly after the meal also. Now you just get drinks along with the meal, and they do not ask if you want a refill. Very ordinary service and not very friendly staff either."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Singapore to Jakarta,February 2024,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,1.0,3,no,4,"  I embarked on a journey with high hopes and anticipation, having secured a connecting flight ticket from Penang to Singapore, and then onwards to Jakarta. Opting for Singapore Airlines, renowned for its outstanding reputation in both air travel and service, I anticipated nothing less than a seamless experience. The cost of this connecting flight amounted to MYR 1601, roughly USD 335, a price I was more than willing to pay for quality service. My journey commenced with a minor delay in takeoff from Penang. The flight proceeded smoothly, accompanied by a light snack comprising a slice of pizza and a beverage of choice. As we approached Changi Airport, the situation took an unexpected turn. The captain announced a delay in landing, estimating an additional 15 to 20 minutes before touchdown. A sense of unease crept over me as my connecting flight departure time loomed closer. Despite my concerns, I remained optimistic, trusting in the efficiency of Singapore Airlines to navigate any challenges seamlessly. Upon landing at 12:05 pm and disembarking at 12:18 pm, I was met with a startling realization. Rather than a smooth transition to my connecting flight, I was handed a new ticket, rescheduled for departure at 4:10 pm, accompanied by a SGD 15 food voucher for Burger King and Coffee Bean.  I sought clarity from the attendant, only to be met with dismissiveness. The absence of any acknowledgment or attempt at redress left me deeply disappointed. The disregard for my time and the indifferent handling of the situation underscored a gap in the airline's commitment to customer service. In retrospect, my expectation for exemplary hospitality and proactive problem-solving from a reputed airline like Singapore Airlines was regrettably unmet. As I reflect on this experience, I am reminded of the importance of genuine care and consideration in customer service, particularly in moments of inconvenience or distress."

The first sector was faultless, the crew attentive, no rush with the meal service and a crew member always wandering around the business cabin checking on passengers, topping up drinks etc. magnificent. The next sector started well with friendly and attentive crew, however, after the meal service the entire crew serving business disappeared and were only seen if the bell was rung! A shame because this now seems to be the norm. Rush the meals, dim the lights and hide!"

Both the travel agent and I have been trying to get in touch via phone, sms and online forms and they are not responding at all. The travel agent no longer wants to know after a month and a half of trying, they sent me an email for me to try direct, Singapore will not speak to me despite my telling them the agent has wiped his hands of it. Today I found out I will not get my full refund if I were to cancel because the agent took out travel insurance on my behalf without advising me at all. I always have my own travel insurance why would I need another. "

Apart from a slight mishap in Singapore this was one of the best flights I have ever had. The quality of the service was outstanding. Crew worked throughout unlike many European airlines, with great attentiveness. I know because I never sleep. The quality of the food was superb. From my experience both Singapore airlines and Thai have the best training I have come across. Very good entertainment system with many choices. As a yearly flyer there is nothing better than having a long flight where everything works smoothly and people care about you. I can only say thank you. I appreciate your hard work. I will be flying with you again later this year."

The first was a LHR-SIN-LHR flight and another was a SIN-MNL-SIN flight. To cut the story short, I requested to rebook my LHR-SIN flight two weeks ahead of my scheduled flight due to a family bereavement and I needed to be in the Philippines. Despite my personal situation, I received an amazing support from the Customer Service team, who happily reorganised my flight, connected my 2 flight bookings so I can get to Manila on time, and without rebooking fees. At the London airport, I was sent-off warmly by the ground staff who has empathised with me as I check-in and ensure I was boarded comfortably in the plane. These gestures of goodwill and support made me grateful for Singapore Airlines. Even though I am no longer based in Singapore, I will always find a way to fly with them. Thank you. These words are never enough for the outstanding, grateful and sincere help you have provided me."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Melbourne,January 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,1,no,2,"  I flew on SQ217 from Singapore to Melbourne on the 4th of January. My flight was terrible. To begin with my seat was broken and couldn’t be moved and the entertainment device was broken as well. My flight of nearly 8 hours was spent looking blankly into space, seated in the same position. I had severe back pain upon arrival as a result for the next couple of days. When I informed the crew, first the steward said I will be compensated with a voucher and asked me to choose what I like from the duty free catalog. When I did choose a product that would be useful for me, I was told by the air hostess that my voucher is only for $75 Singapore dollars and the rest will have to be paid by me! I informed them I don’t need their $75 voucher and that I will make a formal complaint about the plane’s defects. After my return I did make the complaint and they got back to me saying that another travel voucher of AU$200 will be issued to be used in my next flight with Singapore airlines. But the worst part was they lied and said I was offered another seat but I had declined saying I wanted to be seated next to my husband. This was an outrageous lie. At no point did they offer me another seat. This is very concerning. I would urge everyone flying in SQ next time, to either video any exchange with the crew in situations like this or get it in writing. After discussing with my husband, I informed them that I would not be flying with them in the near future so they can give me a cash voucher. But they replied saying they can only give me a voucher to be used for my future bookings through Singapore airlines. I refused to accept it because I will not fly with them in the future. Even a budget airline would have been more comfortable than this flight. But the greatest worry is their dishonesty."

Pretty much faultless service from one doorstep to the other. Great aircraft, crew, service, food, facilities, lounges, all on time. Sad to say the only faults lay with Auckland airport and its baggage handlers etc. Well done Singapore airlines, I've flown BC long haul with Qatar Airways and Malaysia Airlines this year as well, and SIA is the best alongside Qatar Airways."

We boarded the flight from CCU and flight landed 1 minute before time. Upon landing we have received the notification that our flight has been rescheduled and it will depart at 9.30am. As mentioned before we booked well in advance and paid extra money for forward seats. However with utter surprise we have noticed that they have allocated us three different seats that too rear of the aircraft. While contacting the Transfer desk the customer service lady told us it is not possible to provide us any other seats so that three of us can seat together. She was very rude and not suitable for this kind of job. Being a Krisflyer Gold member this is very disappointing and not at all expected from SIA. "

On the other hand, wishing to make a new reservation, it was impossible to pay online, as I had done previously, and despite around ten calls directly to Singapore (but visibly diverted to other call centers). The employees have nothing to do with it, they follow a protocol, but after 6 hours of attempts, I still haven't been able to pay my ticket. Deficient reservation system, friendly employees but very limited in their knowledge of their reservation system, impossible to reach a manager and promise of a solution in 72 hours. A real shame for an expensive company that claims to be among the best in the world. Nous avons fait un aller-retour Phuket-Singapore qui était exemplaire, de la ponctualité à l'accueil, en passant par les mets et boissons offerts ( Classe affaire ). Par contre, souhaitant effectuer une nouvelle réservation, impossible de payer en ligne, comme je l'avais fait précédemment, et malgré une dizaine d'appels directement à Singapour ( mais visiblement déviés sur d'autres centrales d'appel ). Les employés n'y sont pour rien, ils suivent un protocole, mais après 6 heures de tentatives, je n'ai toujours pas mon pu payer mon billet. Système de réservation déficient, employés sympathique mais très limités dans leurs connaissance de leur système de réservation, impossible d'atteindre un responsable et promesse d'une solution dans..... 72 heures.

The flight was supposed to be 605pm but only departed at about 950pm. It was only informed to us after we checked in and completed our immigration customs check. We have to wait for so many hours in the restricted areas. We booked this airline only instead of budget airlines only because we thought their flights is known to be punctual. But we were wrong. Moreover, the meal provided is a slice of pizza and exactly the same as the meal that was provided when we took the flight from Singapore to Penang. We are expecting at least some changes in the meal. This is really disappointing, that such arrangement is coming from a world class top airlines. There were also no instructions in the flight or emails to instruct you how to get the wifi service up. There was also no inflight entertainment system or even an earpiece for audio music."

✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Melbourne to Zagreb via Singapore / Frankfurt,September 2023,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,3,yes,8,"  The experience was very good on both Outbound to Inbound flights. As we travelled Premium Economy we received priority boarding which was good especially as we were travelling with my 80 year old dad. Premium Economy is very good especially the Leg room, which is the main reason I wanted it and being over double some economy fares it satisfied our needs. Extra recline also made a difference and was bearable even when the person in front was reclining. The Premium Economy cabin only has 4 rows 2-4-2 and is separated from the main economy cabin which made it feel more spacious. We chose the back row so nobody behind us made it feel a little more private and a big gap between us and exit room economy in the next cabin. Flight was smooth and comfortable Staff were great. Helpful and very accommodating when needed. Food was good although had the option to Book the Cook prior to flight. I know some airlines are starting to increase leg room to 40 inches SIN (38) which would be great when you consider the extra money that is paid. On our return from Croatia at Frankfurt there were flight delays which meant we would miss our connection from SIN MEL But both Lufthansa an Singapore Airlines made this a much less stressful experience, in fact a great little adventure. At FRA we received meal vouchers and were updated regularly by helpful staff and when we arrived in SIN everything was organised as soon as we got of the plane. Meal vouchers, hotel vouchers, Taxi to hotel and back, assistance with getting our entry visa on arrival. Choose a good airline and the combo of Lufthansa and especially flying major legs with Singapore Airlines made it an easy, comfortable experience. I would highly recommend."

During my recent flights I used economy, premium economy and business class, the flights were okay nothing spectacular but probably the biggest take away was the poor service on just about every flight apart from 1. Ranging from missed food to dreadful food, just not the Singapore Airlines I know! I used SQ for the consistency of service which is not after COVID not the same, I know many airlines have suffered from experience leaving the work place, but Singapore crew service and consistency are it's trade mark. I travel to South East Asia a lot from both Europe & South Africa so Singapore figured in my travel plans a lot, I will probably use them again in the future but in the meantime I have gone to an alternative for my next round of flights. I would recommend Singapore on some routes simply because the competition is poor."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Frankfurt,November 2023,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," We had the most horrific check-in experience with Singapore Airlines on Nov. 7th flight SQ 25 from JFK to Frankfurt. The check-in area barely had any travelers when we arrived and we were greeted by an agent immediately. The horror began. Our ticket was a one-way ticket since we were going to Split, Croatia (our final destination) for a longer time period for us and, especially, our toddler boy (29 months old traveling with me and my wife of course) to enjoy time with family and friends. Therefore, we purchased an airline ticket for each of us and chose Singapore Airlines as a well-respected travel provider. Each of us had 2 check-in luggage, one carry-on, one backpack, and a car seat for our son. Leaving for an extended period of time with toddlers requires carrying a lot of luggage and we carefully packed it all, measured it, and tried to pay for extra weight online before flying. There was no option for it. As I was taking care of our son, my wife was checking us in at the counter (the first class counter right next to the business class counter in Row 8). I noticed that she became visibly distressed and that the agent was on the phone holding off the check-in procedure. I asked if everything was ok and she responded that the check-in agent was not letting us check in. What he and his supervisor who he was on the phone with, and who seemed to be a business class agent right next to us, said equals absolute harassment and a complete overstepping of their boundaries. They proceeded to tell us that we needed to purchase a separate return ticket each because we won’t be let in to stay in Croatia. This is unheard of, absolutely wrong, and untrue, a situation created by the agent and his supervisor that doesn’t exist. I am Croatian and an American citizen, and my wife and my son are American citizens who can enter Croatia with American passports as they wish. Then, the agent (still on the phone with the next counter supervisor) asked my wife if she had at least $8000 and after taking my Croatian passport said it would be fine for me but not for my wife who never changed her name - so was asked to produce proof of our marriage. Thankfully she carries our marriage certificate in case of this but for other countries as we travel - not for the US! And this “interrogation“ happened in an atmosphere of hostility where the agent and his supervisor, who at some point was having a laughing chat with one of his colleagues, behaved with utmost disrespect towards us as their/your client/customer. Zero courteous smile. Zero understanding. Zero any sort of empathy that we have a toddler with us. We knew that we would pay for extra weight in one piece of luggage (the 9 kg option we couldn’t do online). They proceeded to make us check our two carry-ons that were barely over 7kg (and this has never happened to me or my wife in our 25 years of global flying) at a cost of $700. The Crew and flight were great. The food was horrible and the seats were not too comfy. Also, the customer service was almost ignorant of our complaint and defended their agents' actions without any understanding. Never again Singapore Airlines."

Apparently this was flagged by SQ system at checkin and we need to provide said credit card for checkin staff to scan into SQ system in order to allow us to get his boarding pass. Otherwise we need to sign an indemnity form or risk denied boarding. Fortunately, I did have the credit card used 11 months ago when I booked his flight or both of us would end up in Johannesburg stranded! Reason offered: 1. Fraud detection systems picked this up based off determined parameters. When I challenged this because 11 months SQ would have been paid in full and their ERP system should have the information. 2. Next explanation: within a 12- hour period we charged many transactions on card. When I provided the data which showed we never charged anything within 12 hour either before or after . 3. Their system algorithm is correct in picking this up as “fraud” and good for customer! Empty assurance of prevention when SQ has not provided any explanation how this event was picked up! I am still waiting for someone more senior to pick this up… Interested to ensure that this will not happen to any other passengers who booked tickets at least 3 months in advance of travel date let alone one year ago!"

As there was no chicken available, my kids were given a fish meal that they could not eat. I refused a meal, as I was unable to get a chicken meal. What I was given to understand by the head stewardess that there were not enough meals on the flight. What baffles me is how can the earlier economy seats in the plain get what they want, and we as a family in the latter half were not even given one chicken meal. No where on check-in were we given an option to choose our meals too. Even the head stewardess was of the opinion there was an issue with the allocation of meals. "

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737 Max 8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Penang,May 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Seats that we paid for and confirmed very much earlier had been unfairly re-assigned later on to another person who was their preferred customer without first obtaining our consent or approval; SIA customer service initially informed us the seat was re=assigned due to flight schedule change but it turned out to be false. When they realized, they were wrong, they subsequently changed their position to cancellation and re-booking of our flight by their customer service agents. We did not cancel the flight but it was an error committed by their customer agent. . When the customer service agent re-booked our flight they ensured us that our original seats selection would be the same. We periodically checked with the customer service agents to ensure that our original seats selection were intact. They confirmed and re-confirmed that our original paid seats were unchanged. We also went on to their on-line booking website to confirm that our original seat selections remained intact. On checking in (2 days before flight), we discovered that one of our paid seats was re-assigned to another customer without our prior knowledge and approval. We discovered our seat was re-assigned to a standard seat to the back of the plane. Immediately. we called the customer service agents immediately on the phone to reinstate our paid seats back but they refused to do it. The customer service agents on the phone did not converse well in English and they gave us all the wrong information about the seat change. It was extremely difficult to get through to them on the phone and we had to wait for a long time before we could speak to someone.  The duty manager at airport informed us our paid seat had been changed last minute due to a preferred customer had kicked us out due to his importance. It was unprofessional and unethical for them to do that. We had to fight and argue fervently all the way through at each encounter. Even at the gate, we had to fight and argue to get our seat back after seeking approval from the preferred customer. Escalated the complaints to the senior management (CEO) several times who did not even respond to our complaints.. Actual costs incurred to resolve the airline mistakes amounted to SGD429.65 and they only agreed to issue a voucher of SGD75 which is inadequate to compensate for the actual costs incurred. Moreover, it does not include the additional inherent cost of lost vacation time and stress/frustrations to deal with their mistakes that they had created for us unnecessarily. Customer service investigation focused mainly on the outcome but do not provide fair customer resolution to their mistakes they had committed. The last response received from the customer service agent was that they are happy with the investigation and no further communication and action would be taken i.e. refused to address their mistakes committed and refused to compensate the costs that we had incurred."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Guangzhou to Los Angeles via Singapore,August 2023,3.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I am submitting this review about a terrible experience with Singapore Airlines wherein my family were subject to a 5-hour delay which then caused them to miss their connecting flight and extend the delay to 30+ hours. The delay according to Singapore Airlines was caused by traffic control between Guangzhou and Singapore and the plane had to be diverted to Kuala Lumpur to refuel for more than 2 hours on the tarmac. We missed the connecting flight SQ38 on August 9th to LAX as a result. We were placed in a hotel by SQ adjacent to the airport for a sudden 24hour plus layover near midnight with a ""food coupon"" that we had to fight for as we were starving due to the long delay and no food service on the plane. After arriving at the hotel we found out that those food vouchers were not even valid according to the hotel, Capri by Fraser, and no food service was available. Capri by Fraser's on duty manager in Singapore apparently said they don't take ""food coupons"" from Singapore Airlines for emergency layover guests and that this was a miscommunication with SQ. At near midnight where nearly all restaurants were closed and Capri is far from the city center, how were we expected to get a meal after being misled by Singapore Airline staff at the airport about the availability of food and their miscommunication? What if we were first time guests in Singapore with no knowledge of the local language and not able to navigate the situation? This is a complete failure from a management perspective as logically delayed passengers who miss a connecting flights after a certain time should at least be informed properly if not put in a hotel with 24 room service/dining options in or nearby and given the courtesy of not having to worry about starving on top of rearranging travel plans etc. For an airline with a world class reputation where one pays a premium for the service this just is not acceptable. I submitted a complaint to Singapore Airlines but their complains team threw a response back at me: “as much as we acknowledge the inconvenience you went through as a result of the delay, as an industry practice, and in line with our Conditions of Contract and Carriage, we would like to share that airlines generally do not compensate for consequential losses or inconvenience arising from flight delays.” However, I know international passenger rights stemming from Article 19 of the Montreal Convention. When I brought this up to an SQ customer service supervisor after spending hours on call trying to reach someone who I could speak to about this, I was shocked and concerned to find out that not even supervisor level reps knew about one of the most important international passenger rights conventions. SQ repeatedly mislead and misrepresent int'l passenger rights trying to brush me off. Currently they have ceased responding to my emails and appears to think that ignoring the issue will fix it. I don't know what more I can do at this point but I hope this review will serve to shed light on the holes in SQ's 5 star service and World's Best Airline reputation. I hope no one has to experience what we experienced during that disastrous layover in Singapore."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Kochi to Sydney via Singapore,October 2023,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4,yes,7,  It was a good flight. I would have given a full 10 on 10 review but because of the seats I ain't that satisfied. Business class seats should have been more comfortable when travelling long haul flights.
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Jakarta via Singapore,September 2023,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10," Having flown with a few middle east carriers throughout this route, definitely I was putting a high expectations from this SQ flight. Got the best price compare with another middle eastern carriers with extra 300 AED for extra 5kgs checked in luggage. The check in process was smooth and I was lucky enough to get upgraded to premium eco seat from SIN to CGK. The DXB to SIN flight was really bumpy, but the crew was really courteous and helpful throughout the flight. The food was definitely better than the middle eastern carriers and also free wifi was a nice touch comparing to any other airlines. The service was feel more special on SIN to CGK sector though it was a very short flight. Definitely will choose this again (if the price is right, compare to middle eastern carriers). Good job SQ."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to New York JFK,August 2023,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5,yes,9,"  There was nothing special at Frankfurt airport pre-departure. It was good when we got onboard. The seat on SQ 777-300ER is similar to that on the A350-900ULR, meaning it is spacious and comfortable. Catering from Frankfurt was excellent, and I liked all the dishes served, especially the satay (I heard the satay was brought from Singapore, but I was not sure). Cabin crew were very nice and helpful, as expected from SQ."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Phnom Penh,October 2023,1.0,5.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  The airline's check-in staff charged me an extra $200 for a 10kg backpack, just slightly over the 7kg carry-on limit. This experience was incredibly frustrating and inflexible. "

The meals are low quality for Business class. Also I find the seats not as comfortable as others."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,San Francisco to Singapore,August 2023,,,,,,,1,no,1,"   I have never come across a company that would ask a customer to pay a penalty fee for switching from a cheaper to a more expensive service. I bought a one way Economy class ticket from the US to Singapore at first, planning to take another airline for the other leg of the trip. Being a loyal customer of Singapore Airlines, I decided to be more generous and pay a lot more to buy a 2-way Business class trip in place for the original one-way Economy class ticket. I cancelled the one-way Economy class ticket after buying the 2-way Business class ticket and found that Singapore Airlines charged me a cancellation fee of US$200. I called Singapore Airlines and wrote to ask for the US$200 cancellation fee to be waived and refunded. The experience was a nightmare and the response was shocking to a long time customer. It took a long time to get through the hotline. My request for refund was rejected with no good reason provided. "

We had one oversize package, namely a painting rolled and contained in a tube. We were not sure what to do with it as it was very light but more than a meter long. The staff at the Adelaide airport have done their utmost to help us, they contacted the baggage people, took the tube to them and then dispatched it for us! Amazing. Then on board they welcomed us as if we were long lost friends. Hats off to the crew of Flight. SQ 278 on the 19 Sep."

They were kind courteous and very helpful. The service was excellent. The staff catered to our every need and I will definitely fly Singapore Airlines again. Our flight was on 12th September 2023 and the slight number was SQ 421. A huge thank you to the chief air hostess and to the crew.
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Bangkok to Auckland via Singapore,September 2023,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,3.0,2,no,5,"  We were given a flight with Scoot from Bangkok to Singapore, and then with Singapore to Auckland. The flight with Scoot was perfectly acceptable but what was not was that they decided that we must collect our boarding pass in Singapore which might have been OK but they they never told us where to collect them from, so we we spent ages trying to find the location and only just made it to the gate in time. The previous leg from Milan to Hanoi involved a Scoot flight and we received all our passes in Milan. On the flight when meals were served the crew just appeared at the seat with a tray whilst we were dozing and expected us to put out the table. As we had ordered book the cook, the main meal service took a while and we had finished our meal before drinks were offered. Premium economy food was no better than Economy fare and considering the cost of the flight a little more thought could have gone into the meal."
Not Verified ,A380-800,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Dubai  via Singapore,August 2023,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  We flew an itinerary Melbourne to Dubai return via Singapore in August 2023. We joined their Krisflyer membership. Having done that, we opted in for their ""Auto Check In"" for each flight. Singapore Airlines automatically check you in and email your printable boarding passes 24 hours before each flight departure. You do not have to check yourself in online. Our flights and seating for MEL-Singapore, Singapore-Dubai, Dubai_Singapore we were auto checked in and I printed the boarding passes at the hotel each time. But, while staying in Singapore for 2 days prior to our flight, 24 hours before our SIN-MEL flight, I kept checking my emails for the auto check in. By 1pm, 12 hours before our midnight SQ237 flight I received no auto check in. I knew something was wrong. I called their Singapore call centre and quoted my SQ RES Number, and said I have not received our boarding passes. For no reason, they hung up. I re-dialed the number, another operator, same thing, they hung up. On the third attempt the first thing I said to the operator ""Do not hang up"" I gave my REF booking number and we had pre-allocated seats 41D and 41E. The operator said ""I cannot find this REF number"". I patiently said, "" Go to SQ237 seats 41D&41E  you will see our names on those seats."" Nothing. I started to get distressed but kept my cool. I said ""If we go to the Airport they can sort it out"". No. you are not on that flight. So, I said, "" what do we do?"" He told us we have to re-book the same flight for the next day and pay an extra re-booking fee of $430. At that moment I thought, we just have to get on a flight, book it and work out the problem later. I looked up the seating on my ipad as he was doing the re-booking and requested the vacant seats, 70B&70C. He told me they are not available and put us in a three row on 46DEF. We went to the hotel lobby and booked an extra night at$353. We got to the airport 9 hours before our flight at 3pm, and showed them our paper itinerary at check in and said we did not receive an auto check in email or boarding passes and that 70B&70C are in fact available, and yes they were. Do your own check in online. I am in the process of filing both a complaint and claim to Singapore Airlines."

I fly economy on Singapore Airlines but this was the first time in economy on a SQ long haul flight for about 6 years. Boarding was fine, quickly to my seat 45A, departed a little late but once in the air for around 1 hour service was started. Crew where okay food served quickly and again nothing special just okay. The flight lasting 12 hours passed fairly quick, I found the seats a bit uncomfortable after 4 or 5 hours, the crew where around a little bit and the 2nd meal served 3 hours prior to arrival was okay. Connecting to Bangkok pretty easy and the 2 hour uneventful flight on a new 787 was pretty nice. Returning Check in at Bangkok was quick security and immigration done quickly too, used the Krisflier lounge which was pretty nice, the flight to SIN I was seated in seat 42A, food and drinks where offered but the crew after requesting my choice forgot to deliver the food or a drink, It was a bit odd and the crew on this flight where actually a bit rude anyway. Connection in SIN good again, my flight back to London in Premium Economy, so a chance to compare. Yes of course we are paying for the space, but food and crew are the same as economy. Premium Economy wise I think SQ is okay, I will continue to use, because it's normally consistent but there are better and much cheaper Premium Economy options around."
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Family Leisure,Business Class,New York to Frankfurt,September 2023,,,,,,2.0,5,yes,10,"  My wife and I had booked a trip to Europe. We unfortunately had to cancel the day before we were scheduled to leave due to a death in the family. I did not have trip insurance and had obtained the tickets with miles. The miles were not refundable. I called Singapore and after providing medical documentation, they generously credited me my miles back so we can re-book our trip at a later date. To me, this is the sign of a FIRST CLASS organization. They were in their rights not to refund the miles, but they did. I have flown Singapore for years, even if a had to take a second flight to arrive at my destination. I will continue to use Singapore every chance I get. I give them 5 stars for their compassion, consideration and rapid response. Thank you."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737 Max and A380,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Penang to Melbourne via Singapore,September 2023,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,5,yes,8," Check-in and boarding in Penang were smooth. The lounge in Penang was quite ordinary but completely adequate. On board, the window seat was very comfortable, though storage was limited. My pre-ordered vegetarian meal hadn't been loaded, so I was given a very bready pizza from Economy class. At Changi the Singapore Business lounge in Terminal 3 was vastly superior to those of most airlines, even when crowded. The process of boarding the A380 was smooth. The seat was comfortable and converted into a good bed, but a little tight around the feet. My vegetarian meal was delicious. The number of toilets in the Business section was limited, and there were Economy-type queues in the morning. The luggage was available quickly. Overall a very good experience."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777 / 787-10,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Melbourne to Fukuoka via Singapore,June 2023,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,yes,8,"  At Melbourne airport the check-in was very quick and friendly, and the lounge was pleasant and had a good selection of food and drink. Onboard the cabin crew was welcoming, and the seat on the B777 was very comfortable with adequate storage though the diagonal arrangement for lying flat was awkward. No amenities kit was provided. The quality of the vegetarian meals was way above that of other airlines. The flight arrived in Singapore a little early and transfer to a nearby gate for the second leg to Japan leaving in 70 minutes was easy. The boarding process was efficient, and the crew on the B787 were also welcoming and the seat was comfortable (not diagonal for sleeping), though storage space was more limited. The flight arrived on time and luggage was available quickly. All in all a very pleasant journey."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Singapoe to Christchurch,September 2023,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,3.0,3,yes,10,"  I cannot speak highly enough of the superlative service received on this flight. After I lost one earbud deep down into my seat the crew were determined to retrieve it for me - the lovely hostess thrust her wrist into the seat workings and fished out my earbud, sustaining some pain and minor abrasion. Unbelievable devotion to service! Every other aspect of the crew's service was impeccable as well. I can wholeheartedly recommend Singapore Airlines - I have just flown Economy Class from London to Singapore and the service was fabulous on that flight as well. I am writing this review on in-flight wi-fi - seems to be working fine, for the first time in my experience."

Not Verified ,A350-900,Business,Premium Economy,Singapore to Paris,September 2023,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1,no,2," Premium economy in Singapore Airlines is terrible. The seats are hard and uncomfortable, the food is the same as economy and there is no separate toilet in the PE cabin (only the economy toilets). We had to ask for a bottle of water, there was no amenity kit and when we asked for socks, the kit we received contained socks and a toothbrush (no toothpaste). The staff were nice but premium economy is simply a premium price for economy quality. Next time I need to go to Europe, I'll look to transit through the US rather than Singapore."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Melbourne,September 2023,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10," SQ227 in Economy. Booked in April. Fare was Starting at $1600.00USD, luckily I was able to use my mileage for this trip. Gate opened right on time, with Cabin Crew going through Security after me. I boarded last, and was welcomed aboard. Crew made comments on my Attaché, saying ""You look like 007"", and other nice touches. One asked ""I like that! Is that A Rimowa?"" Nice to see SQ crew attentive, with small touches. Cabin jammed, Had to go around to get to my seat. I sat 62G, and had no Overhead Bin. So I had to use another one. Throughout the flight nobody disturbed my stuff. Luckily my Attaché fit under the seat. Also there is only 1 Lavatory in the rear of the Aircraft. We got served a lovely dinner. I noticed one of the Female crew members, was in a Suit. Flying with SQ since 2008, had me pondered. After the meal I engaged her in some conversation. She said ""I am a Flight Auditor. Do you have any Feedback Sir?'. I didn't tell her about the appallingly horrific SQ check in at FRA, but maybe I should have. I settled in to sleep. One of the Cabin Attendants asked me if I wanted an aid to cover my eyes, but I said no, and I flew asleep. Woke up 90 minutes out, and was served refreshment. Multiple coffee rounds commenced, with crew approaching sleeping passengers for Refreshment. Landed MEL, with announcements on Luggage coming out late, however no SQ Ground Staff at the Luggage Carousel. If I go to Australia again, I would definitely fly Singapore Airlines."

Bought Tickets in April. SQ Counter at EWR rather late to open, however incoming aircraft arrived late. Staff didn't know final destination, and I had to help them. No bother, as they appreciated it, and checked my Rimowa through. Cabin Crew arrived 40 minutes before boarding time. Ground staff again were novice, and boarding was kind of ""rough"" due to misplaced announcements. I was the last to board. Upon boarding was greeted throughout my walk to my seat. One Attendant even asked where I was going, smiled, and got out of the way. SQ Premium Economy Solo Seat so comfortable, and side bin holds so much. Took off on time, to a lovely sunny day. Had to use the Lavatory, and had to wait, because a Cabin Attendant was cleaning it. She noticed me, and expedited her clean. On IFE the ""Old is Gold"" section is gone, but a excess of Old movies were available, and I watched Star Wars. A drink run commenced, then Lunch. When they arrived for Lunch, the Attendant Instantly apologized, and said they only had 1 meal type however, however promised multiple options later. So I went ahead, and had it. Was tasty, followed my Ice Cream, and another drink round. I dozed off, and woke up over Denmark. Went to use the Lavatory again, however it was again being cleaned. Snack/drink runs were conducted. Really appreciate the crew on the details. Had the second meal of Iraq/Iran. I had the Seafood option. Was exceptional, hot too symphony of flavors. More drink runs followed. I dozed off again, and woke up with a Made in Italy pocket Pizza next to me. Landed SIN, to a beautiful evening. Once again SQ21, SQ23 Exceptionally shine."

The ground crew were asking for email confirmation and attempted to charge us 600+ euros for the extra weight (€60/kg) despite our allowance supposedly covering this. Then the ground crew advised us to pay now and attempt to claim later (which in a previous experience which costed me €2000 didn’t get me any return) We turned up 4 hours before our flight. It’s been 2 while being on hold again for another hour to get re-confirmation. If you value you your time more than this avoid them if you can, pre-covid, Singapore was best in class. Now they’ve begun to nose-dive."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Cairns via Singapore,July 2023,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,4,no,7,"  I have always had a good cabin experience with Singapore and been a Gold Member for decades. However a recent baggage issue has left me gobsmacked by their tardiness and callous behaviour. Landed in SIN on a stopover and noticed my Delsey case (only 12kg total check in) had a 6 inch case fracture. I reported it and received a case number. On arriving into Cairns the next day, there was no customer service representative visible so I could not pursue the matter. After calling SQ in Singapore after 3 weeks I was finally emailed by a local representative who saw the bag damage photos and offered 100 dollars full settlement for a new bag worth 400 dollars.  The experience has let me reconsider any future SQ travel plans."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Vancouver to Delhi via Singapore,August 2023,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3,no,5,  Baggage handling was very poor. My new suitcase was very badly handled. All 4 wheels were broken and pulling handle was jammed. Upon lodging complaint they simply said this is caused by routine handling and airline can do nothing about it. This was very bad and was not expected from an airline among top airlines of the world.

Very impressed to see Singapore Airlines continuing to be one of my favourite airlines to travel with.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Sinhapore,August 2023,,,,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Singapore Airlines impressed me with their outstanding customer service. Despite the unfortunate incident of my stolen passport, they rebooked my flight twice at no cost, showing exceptional flexibility and support. Their quick responses, transparent communication, and genuine care for passengers make them a top choice for hassle-free travel. Kudos to Singapore Airlines for turning a potentially disastrous situation into a shining example of world-class service. "

No regrets! The service, food and everything is way better than other airlines we flew with, including Emirates last year (gluten-free meals on Singapore Airlines are very tasty, unlike Emirates GF meals). Impeccable service that caters for all the needs and even whims of passengers, including my request for a slice of lemon for my tea (the Polish way), which Nadine fullfilled with ease and a smile on the SQ325 flight on 16 July 2023. God bless you, Nadine!"

After fighting them for months they finally agreed to give me some money for losing my stuff. They approved it back on May 18th. They said please allow a month for final approval. Here it is July 17th and still nothing. Singapore Airlines has by far the worst customer service I have ever seen. Please do not fly Singapore Airlines.
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900ULR,Family Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to New York,April 2023,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,9," SQ Silver Kris Lounge in Changi T3 was as good as normal, with excellent food choices and good seating. The flight itself was uneventful, despite a slight delay on departure. The flight was quite bumpy for sometime over Japan, which was expected and announced by the captain. Though this had nothing to do with the airline, I realized that American carriers tend to change route and altitude when encountering turbulence, while Asian carriers seem just to go through that, and I experienced that quite consistently. I ordered my meals through book-the-cook, and the Boon Tong Kee chicken rice was underwhelming, while the lobster thermidor was nice. Service was excellent as expected. Wi-fi was complementary for J passengers, and it worked quite well."
Not Verified ,A380,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,New York to Frankfurt,May 2023,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5,yes,6," I was looking forward very much to the experience on Singapore Airlines, and even more so, the A380. I was in the bulkhead seat in Premium Economy, so the very first row on the lower level. It was a nice smooth flight, The IFE was adequate, But I was a little disappointed with the level of service. I've always heard about how attentive ""The Singapore Girl"" (ie.flight attendants on SQ) were The service was far from the worst I have ever had on an airline, but not as good as I anticipated. Maybe I was comparing it to the absolute best service I have ever had on an airline I flew on my last overseas flight, a Taipei-based airline. Don't get me wrong, It was not bad at all - just not as good I was expecting."

One of the staff at the plane door who supposed to help my wife to cover the baby stroller with a plastic bag refused to do the job with ours and ask my wife to do it by herself. We saw him covered other's baby stroller with a plastic bag in front of our eyes but refused to do the same thing with ours. This is unacceptable and very rude. "

The Song Hong Lounge was decent, with good food and nice view of the apron. Singapore Airlines used an A350-900 for a 3-hour flight, which was amazing. Our book-the-cook meals were decent, though not as good as I would like. In-flight service was excellent."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Family Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Ho Chi Minh,April 2023,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5,yes,9,"  The Silver Kris Lounge at SIN T3 was big and nice. However, finding good seating during peak time was still challenging. The lounge offered good selection of food including Western, Chinese and local options. The flight was on SQ regional A350-900, which has similar flatbed seats as other premium airlines' long-haul equipment. That was really nice for a sub 2-hour flight. In-flight food service was very nice for such a short flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900XLR,Family Leisure,Business Class,New York to Singapore,April 2023,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5,yes,7,"  I was supposed to fly on SQ25 to Singapore via Frankfurt. The flight was canceled after we are at the gate for 4 hours past the departure time without any explanation. Being flown with SQ for many times, I suspect this had to do with JFK rather than the airline. However, they should still bear the responsibility for addressing to their customers. We were rebooked to the non-stop SQ23 to Singapore the following day. We ended up on the A350-900XLR, which was quite nice, but I still prefer their A380. Due to the flight change, we did not get our book the cook meals. In-flight service was quite nice as expected from SQ."

When I boarded the flight was advised I could have either the GF meal or the Vegan. As the GF had dairy in it was not suitable, and the Vegan has gluten in. They advised me to contact the staff at the airline when I arrived to organise the return flights.  I had fruit which the lovely cabin crew sourced from business class and a bag of potato chips.  I contacted our travel agent to be informed I was listed for the GF vegan meals. So contacted Singapore airlines, the person I spoke to said it was not acceptable that I needed a combination of the two they only dealt with one allergy per person! I would need a Drs certificate if I had to have it. He then told me to take my own food. Which I ended up doing, but the amount of room available on the plane is minimal and awkward to get to bags when you’re elderly. Again the crew managed to source some fruit for me. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Milan,June 2023,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3,no,6," I find it appalling that SA’s flight attendants allow children seated in Economy to come visit their parents in Business. I didn’t pay in excess of $5000 per ticket to be sharing the aisle with other people and be irritated by the noise produced. I was seated in 17D, the person in question was in A17, his child came at night and they played loud games, I was hearing the child’s talking and laughing through my sleep. I believe that it’s not professional behavior on the part of SA’s FAs and they shouldn’t be allowed to place parents and minors in different classes, let alone let the visitors in, no matter what age. I will not be flying Singapore Airlines any longer unless this problem gets fixed."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Manchester to Singapore,June 2023,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3,no,5,  Worst business class seats. Why does SQ still have business class seats where the place to put your feet is not in line with the rest of your body? And the transition from bed to sitting is NOT a button push. Rather: Get out of seat. Flip seat with handles. Get back into seat/bed.
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Singapore,May 2023,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,4.0,3,yes,7,"  I flew to Singapore from London Heathrow in economy class on the SQ319 Airbus A380. Flight left and arrived on time. The positives: Flight crew were pleasant, friendly and polite. They still have high standards and give you a lovely welcome when you arrive onboard. Seats were fairly comfortable and enough space to stow your belongings and move around the cabin. Was given a sleeping pillow and a blanket. Negatives: Singapore Airlines have cut the quality and diversity of food and drinks that they have on offer. It was not the standard of food previously experienced on SQ flights. Presentation not good - now just mediocre. No juice, water or alcoholic beverages offered when you first get on the plane. No menu. Toilets weren’t clean and very small. You no longer get an amenity kit with toothbrush, eye shades, ear plugs, or socks or a newspaper. Bring back the hot towel service."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Auckland via Singapore,February 2023,1.0,5.0,4.0,,,4.0,3,no,6,"  We travelled on Singapore Airlines many years ago in economy class. We travelled this time in business class because of the long flight. The service provided on the latest trip was very good, however we did pre order some food that disappointingly did not arrive but the flight menu options were good. The biggest problem we had was the seating arrangements in business class, the seats were hard and uncomfortable. A weird cover was provided to increase comfort. The problem was no calf support and any way shape or form, this has a big impact on leg comfort. There was a flap thing that came out but onlyto the back of the knee which was so useless. The second problem was there was no tunnel to slide into for a flat sleeping position. Instead of the tunnel there was a shelf that had to be pulled out but this was to the side of the seat. Instead of laying flat which we were supposed to achieve the side shelf meant sleeping at an angle which was so uncomfortable. I do not understand why Singapore Airlines would ever believe that their seating arrangements would provide comfort. Cost is huge for these additional benefits for both comfort and health as older people travelling. The outcome is of course we won’t be travelling business class with Singapore Airlines again which is really sad."

I booked an air ticket and the flight departure timing was brought forward by 7 hours. We had the option to accept, reschedule or cancel to get a refund. I chose the third option but was put thru multiple individuals who do not seem to know what they are doing (each contradicting the other) but eventually, I received an email to say the refund was being processed and it would take 6 weeks. Well, it was the 6th week yesterday and I wrote in to enquire, only to be told they will be processing it now. Today I received another email (a proper refund notice this time) to say it will be another 6 weeks for the refund to come thru. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Business,First Class,Singapore to Sydney,May 2023,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4,yes,6,"  The First Suite has a lot of space and a lot of gadgets, and some fellow travelers might be impressed. I was rather disappointed by the outline and design of the suite. The bed is not in the direction of the travel, but across the suite. It is narrow and very hard. If the bed is in the non-sleeping position, then it just hangs at the wall to the next suite like a white chunk of wood. In order to dine from the table one has to turn the chair towards the aisle, or towards the fellow traveller in the opposite suite (which is not very private, when, as in my case, the door does not close properly). On both legs to and from Sydney there were technical issues in the suite: either the door could not be closed properly, or the entertainment system did not work at all, or not properly, the seat belt did not fit into the mattress, etc. To add as well, that Singapore Airlines seems to have cut the quality and diversity of the food and wine on offer. Only the Caviar was nicely presented and met the quality standard of First Class food. (On my way to Singapore I have enjoyed Swiss and their First Class product. For a frequent traveller their product was First Class all over, (only with the exception of the bathroom). "
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Auckland to Singapore,May 2023,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,4,yes,9,  I flew with SQ to and from Auckland on the A 350 - 6 May and 22 May. Both flights were a very nice experience. All flight crew very pleasant and helpful and an especial thanks to Edward - senior flight crew on the outward bound flight from Auckland to Singapore. He epitomised the high standards the SQ expect from their staff. Seats fairly comfortable but slightly awkward layout in the lie flat mode with foot well at an angle. I ordered book the cook and the meals were delicious apart from the Thai Red curry served on the Auckland Singapore leg which was reminiscent of boarding school stew with no flavour. Toilet cleanliness maintained to a high standard. However on both legs the sleeping pillow smelled sour. I am sure the pillow cases were clean but the actual pillows require regular washing as well. Please bring back the hot towel service .
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,First Class,Singapore to London,May 2023,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,4,yes,7,"  From start to finish, the service, food, and cabin crew provided the very best. There are only 4 first class seats on the 777 and as expected more than enough space to stow belongings and move around the cabin. The cabin crew were attentive without being intrusive. Only two negatives. The toilets are tiny and one almost needs to be a contortionist to get changed into pyjamas and the seats although very wide do not have much padding or recline so are uncomfortable for sitting in for long periods of time. In the lie flat mode a good mattress was provided which made the bed comfortable. Food was exceptional and beautifully presented. Only hope that the hot towel service makes a comeback."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,First Class,London to Singapore,May 2023,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,10,  Suites on the A380 are in terms of comfort and layout 100% better than on the SQ 777 although the high standard of service remains the same for both aircraft. Lovely welcome from the staff and the cabin crew are exceptionally well presented in grooming and demeanour.  I also am appreciative that I was addressed by my title and surname as I am of that older generation that appreciates such niceties. The suite very comfortable and lovely to have a seperate bed. The two bathrooms are spacious with many amenities and the food glorious. A very special thank you to senior flight crew Tasha (from Indonesia) who was so friendly and epitomised all that is excellent with SQ and also to Kelvin whom I think was the flight manager.
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Business,Business Class,New York JFK to Frankfurt,April 2023,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2,yes,5," The A380 layout is nice in appearance, but I have never experienced a business class seat that requires you to lay at an angle in order to use the footrest space. The seats were the hardest I have ever encountered in business class & very uncomfortable. My seat on my outbound or return flights operated properly and I had to call for flight attendant assistance numerous times when the seat buttons simply failed to work. No amenity kits were provided, which was a 1st for any business class flight I have experienced. You had to request eye shades, ear plugs or slippers, with razors, combs, toothbrushes etc. available in the restrooms. It was a significant time after boarding before any drinks were served but it was only juice or water & no champagne was offered. Food in both directions were mediocre at best. Wine offerings were insulting, flight attendants pour no more than 2"" into the small glasses, since that was the serving in the 3 requests we made. The Cabin Staff were polite, courteous & professional, but not nearly as service oriented as Qatar or many other 5-Star airlines. We found it quite telling that SG used the Air India Lounge for their business class passengers at JFK, even though Air India is regularly rated as 1 of the lowest quality airlines Worldwide. At least at FRA they used Air Canada's Lounge which was a major improvement, but there was zero preference for business class passengers at FRA boarding. Overall, we found them to be totally disappointing and it failed to deliver the same quality business class service I have had on many other carriers."

I flew from Johannesburg to Bangkok on 20/05/2023. Upon arrival, I noticed my luggage was damaged (the bottom of my bag was broken and the wheel broke off). I contacted Singapore airlines for assistance. they replied with several different emails requesting documentation and pictures which I sent. I am flying back to Johannesburg tomorrow (29/05/2023) without a bag I can use. I've indicated the urgency to Singapore airlines but theres no regard for this. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Manchester to Singapore,May 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Left 2.5 hours late and we almost missed our Singapore Airlines connecting Flight as the Skyrail between terminals was not working and we had 25 mins to get from terminal 1 to Terminal 3. When we arrived at the gate we were told to go to, By Singapore Airlines Sign as we Departed our flight. The gate was shut. We found out by a passerby that the gate changed 2.5 hours previously and was now another 10 mins further on, we made it but our luggage did not. We got on plane to find we were seated separately.  We booked in with staff together & we arrived together. We got to Manchester and were told luggage would be about 4 days. on the 5th day we went to the Airport 2 hours later we emerged hopeful & our baggage arrived on the 6th Day only to find the suitcase with missing roller & damaged. We had to use our own money to buy underware, toiletries, clothes for 2 people & a suitcase. This will be refunded but in the meantime we had to use our own money. I get to the airport to fly out this morning & there is no register of my Vegetarian meal on departing flight and I did enter it at the same time I did the previous flight.  We lost 1/3 of our holiday 100% due to delays. We were allowed to go to the Business Class lounge on the way out as compensation, I should be grateful for Vegetarian Sausages before I leave & a glass of Wine.  Compensation should have been upgrade to business class. We paid extra Premium Economy as we thought it would be more comfortable and relaxing but couldn't have been worse. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Los Angeles to Singapore,May 2023,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,no,2,  Very poor service from flight attendants. There was no menu and couldn’t understand what the attendants were offering for a meal because of the mask. Food was served few hours into flight. Wine selection was bad.

✅ Trip Verified ,A380-800,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Singapore,February 2023,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4,yes,8," Always loved Singapore Airlines and flew them in all classes many many times. On this occasion flew them on a night flight from Frankfurt to Singapore. Aircraft got switched from an A350 onto A380 on the day and generally that is a great thing, as always love an A380. However my bulk head seat was not the same/good option as it was on the A350. A380 Business Class bed is rather hard, so not the most comfortable to sleep in. In that regard prefer the A350/777 and the older A380s much more! I ordered a Gluten free meal and unfortunately the dinner main was pretty much inedible. Which is a shame. Breakfast was fine however. Service and crew were excellent as usual."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo to London via Singapore,May 2023,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2,no,5,"  HND-SIN was pretty poor. Cabin staff didn't seem very happy. Virtually had a bread roll thrown at me. Meal (only one on a 7-hour flight!) was not hot enough - cold in places - and tasteless. Bag drop at HND was a disgrace - the 'online check in' queue moved faster than the other one - with only two desks open it took 40 minutes. There seems to be no benefit or reason to checking in online. The Singapore Airlines app is not very good either. SIN-LHR-SIN were better. Good cabin staff and service, and the food was hotter and better. Bag drop at LHR was smooth. Boarding well organized and smooth. The pilot explained a 'touch and go' landing at LHR well and there was no panic, but it did mean we were 20 minutes late - and we were already a little behind schedule. Singapore airport is a pain as every gate as its own security check, which took quite a long time on the outward trip. I prefer airports where no further checks are needed for transit passengers. SIN-HND was better and the meals were quite good, as was the service. Plane was old, though. Booked the tickets eight months in advance, and they were never cheaper, yet they were only reasonable. Wi-Fi is only available if you register your Kris Flyer number before you board, which I couldn't because I'd already registered by ANA Mileage number. Why have this restriction?"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kochi to Singapore,May 2023,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3,no,4,"  
We used this airline recently for our trip to India and will not recommend this airline . Both ground service and cabin crew service not very friendly neither very welcoming. For a 16 hour straight flight you get two full meals and the snacks are just some nuts. No sandwiches are offered unless you ask for it. Meal services are also different, kids are not served first always.(sometimes yes they do). Meals also has no varieties like others  like no fruits or yogurt. We were very excited when we got the tickets as it was our first time using this airline but will not use in the future."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Singapore,May 2023,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2,no,4,  What has happened to SQ. I believe since COVID they have embarked on a wide ranging cost cutting exercise focusing on charging as much as they can for flights while skimping on what they offer customers. It starts with the lounge which resembles a crowded bus station where you need to search for a seat. Bring back the old lounges! On the flights there are no hot towels. No newspapers. No nuts before dinner. No amenity kits. No mattresses.  Food is mediocre. The only thing that hasn’t changed is the first class cabin crew. I have been a flyer with SQ for over 25 years and have never known it so bad.
✅ Trip Verified ,A359,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brisbane to Singapore,April 2023,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,,3.0,3,no,4," It's been a long while since I've flown Singapore Airlines, and they've consistently received accolades for their service, even in Economy Class. However, I was extremely disappointed with their service, especially the catering on board a 7hr flight from Brisbane to Singapore. The aircraft was a new A350, and I had a nice bulkhead seat which allowed me to stretch out. The inflight entertainment was quite good, and the redeeming factor for this flight. Unfortunately, the service and staff was mediocre, and not warm or approachable as I remembered. The food was just awful, especially for a medium haul flight, which consisted of meat and veggies just piled on top of gooey rice. Not even a salad or appetiser (which they used to serve), and a cold bun (there was an ice cream dessert). The washroom was filthy, wet and sticky floor, toilet paper in the sink, even just after the first hour or so, and clearly the crew did not pay much attention to cabin cleanliness (unlike other airlines, where I've seen crew inspect the facilities and do a bit of cleaning). Check in and baggage delivery was fine at the airport (but this may be as I have priority status). But overall, very disappointed with how the quality of service of a reputable airline has declined so much."
✅ Trip Verified ,A359,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Los Angeles,May 2023,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,10," SQ38 SIN-LAX on May 9th on a 359. This is the longest leg of return trip from SE Asia with Hubby. The flight is full, mostly with couples and single travelers. In Singapore there is another security check at the waiting room gate, and most travelers didn't realize they have to go through it to go to the waiting room. Many of the these are the infrequent or first time travelers who don't know that they have to scan their electronics and take off their belts jackets and caps off again, making a long line that moved very slow. Boarding was done by zone and was quite orderly, however there was still a line of latecomers going through the waiting room gate check when the boarding begins. This makes the flight have to leave 25 minutes later than scheduled. The FAs were all wearing masks as per their company's precaution and safety awareness policy. However they were all still very friendly, personable, helpful, courteous and polite, and dedicated in giving their best service. The service started as soon as we reached cruising altitude, started with a drink service then dinner, and a second drink service after that. Many of the travelers are Indians so the FAs quickly ran out of the vegetarian meal option that my Hubby was interested in and he had to settle for chicken with pasta, which is very good. After dinner the lights were turned off so people can sleep, but we were told that snacks is available in between the dinner and lunch that will be served 2 hours prior to landing. The cockpit crew communicated well, explaining about the flight plan before we leave and updating us of LAX condition before our descent. They were very good in identifying possible turbulence ahead so we always get notifications to fasten our seat belts before it hits. Restrooms were always kept clean and the FA frequently refresh them with deodorizer. The entertainment system is amazing and full of latest movies as usual, and it's hard to pick and choose what you want to watch next. As with our previous SQ flight, this aircraft has large 11"" touchscreen with a USB ""A"" that works, and the headphone plug requires two prongs, however it still works well with my wireless headphone adapter which only has one plug. The seat slides forward as you recline so it is a better position to get some rest in a semi reclining position. The lights were turned on just before drink service and lunch was served, and the FAs worked hard to serve us and get everything done before we start our descent into LAX. We arrived at LAX 1 hour ahead of schedule thanks to the strong tailwind. During a bathroom break I casually mentioned to one of the FAs that the day before was my birthday and this trip is to celebrate both our birthdays and our 10 years anniversary. After lunch suddenly we were given two cakes with two glasses of champagne with a ""happy anniversary"" written on the plate, and a card from the crew! Wow, I didn't see that coming! Shout out to all SQ38 crews on May 9th 2023! Thank you for your kindness and gifts!"

The flight used a 78X and it was full of vacationers mostly families, and many of them may have not traveled by air before so it takes time to line everybody up for boarding. Boarding was done by zones and it was a good thing that boarding time was an hour before departure time, because ground staff had to weed out people lining up not in their boarding zone. The flight attendants were as usual with SQ, very nice courteous and polite, and very helpful even with the most clueless passengers. Soon we were all seated and left just 15 minutes behind. Service started as soon as the plane level off, and the FAs were very efficient yet friendly and communicative. One of them even gave us our second round of Singapore Sling without us asking, and we really appreciate him! For a short 2 hours flight the FAs were able to do two beverage service and a meal in between, and that must be quite a challenge for them! The meal offered are using their new sustainability concept, with paper containers and bamboo cutlery so they can be recycled. We found this an excellent proof that SQ is serious in their effort to go green and reducing use of non-biodegradable materials like plastics. The paper container is quite sturdy and even retains good heat for my Nasi Lemak. The portion was a bit smaller but the taste is just the same compared to past ones I had on SQ. The FAs on this SQ flight wears the mask at all times, as part of their company's safety awareness effort. The cockpit crew gave information about the flight plans before we leave and current Singapore condition just before we start our descent, and we arrived just 10 minutes behind schedule. Overall this is another great flight with SQ."

In an era of self-check in kiosks and self-serve apps, the human touch it provides to all its passengers is remarkably special and the warmth and comfort of the human element is something that is irreplaceable by technology. The cabin crew truly went above and beyond to ensure that the passengers were well looked after. In addition to that, every other aspect of the flight from the checking-in process, lounge, boarding arrangements, punctuality, cabin announcements, seat comfort and functionality, meal service, inflight WiFi and timing and baggage delivery was also seamless and flawless. Flying in Singapore Airlines on a premium cabin is truly and quite literally a heavenly experience at 40,000ft in the sky."

I couldn't understand why the flight was delayed for 40 minutes due to late passengers. While Singapore Airlines uses environmentally friendly cutlery on its short-haul flights the quantity of food served has been reduced. The unbearable thing for me was that I am a Gold member of Star Alliance, but on arrival to Denpasar I had to wait for 50 minutes for the priority baggage of this flight. The plane arrived at the gate at 21:07, but it was already 22:00 when I got my luggage. Finally, although the entertainment system interface was very nice, there were not many good movies and music options for me. "

It’s inferior to Qatar Airways business class : underwhelming lounges, okay onboard catering, no dining-on-demand, quirky flat-bed seats (on the A350ULR and more so on the new A380), meager amenities onboard. The cabin crew is somewhat the only part of Singapore Airlines nearly on par with Qatar Airways."

In all my experience flying with Singapore Airlines, this was the first time I saw more stewards than stewardesses on board. While the cabin crew service was excellent as usual, I would like to give a special shout out and thanks to Cheryl, Jessica and Crystal for their top notch service that is befitting of the Singapore Girl name. On the contrary, the inflight meal was a disappointment. From the menu selection and food quality to the presentation, they are not fit to be served on board an airline as prestigious as Singapore Airlines. The pandemic is over. It's time to revitalise the quality of your inflight meals."

Once in the air lunch served which is the regional boxed meal, I think it's a great idea for short flights, food was good served by a really great crew. Arrived SIN little bit early I had to transfer from T3 to T2 which is no problem even had time to visit the Krisflyer Gold Lounge for a coffee and be at the gate for my connection.

Understandable. Less understandable was the disorganized response, which included vague instructions on updates, a lack of transparency on continued delays after weather cleared. The flight departed late and I was told that my luggage would be on my connecting flight, but when I landed in HKG it was not. When I contacted SIA they refused to offer me any compensation for my delayed flight, and asked for an e-ticket number for my original Scoot ticket (e-ticket numbers are nowhere to be found on Scoot ticket receipts or in the booking on the app, which disappears after your flight date). Everything they did to help was simply a deflection of responsibility. "

The staff always moving around the cabin when it is semi dark as some people are not asleep, offering drinks or snacks to keep up the enjoyment of flying. The food from Brisbane is a big improvement from June 2022 but the food on the return Singapore to Brisbane was a let down with cold and tough beef and two rude female cabin staff but otherwise great service on all flights.

This flight makes a short stop in Johannesburg where passengers remain on the aircraft, a small lunch served on the first leg by a nice crew. With a new crew departed JNB on time for the 10 hour flight to Singapore, food lunch/breakfast and service during the flight very good as was the seat and TV Options. Arrival in Singapore a little early after a pretty bumpy flight, transfer was fine using the Silverkris lounge in T3 for a coffee and shower before boarding the flight to Bali this time on a 787-10 my favorite SQ Aircraft. Departed a little late for this 2hour 20 minutes flight, crew very nice as was the food, bags delivered to the belt quickly all in all a great trip. I believe SQ are still up with the best.

First time for me with SIA, in a very long flight in Premium. Very positive the attitude of the whole cabin crew: very kind, professional and available to satisfy passenger requests. Food and drink were the same than economy, besides they supplied sleeping masks and socks for the night flight only after we requested them. Poor IFE, and annoying loud music during the whole descent and until arrival at the finger. All in all very good crew, but I suspect that in these last years they lost something regarding the quality they were famous for."
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore,April 2023,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,2,no,4,"  My flight started on March 18 KUL-FRA and we were asked to check in our Baby stroller at the gate and we will get it in Germany. The food was not same as before and the quality is pretty bad. Upon arrival we were informed that our stroller did not make the flight and it was delay for 3 days. Worse part when the stroller was return it was damaged. On our return flight April 15 FRA - KUL We found out that our original seats which was bassinet seats were changed and we had to go to the airport early to make sure that my baby has a bassinet. This was very frustrating for us with a 1yr old baby. We were also ask to check in at the gate another bag that contains my baby items as it was too big to go into the overhead cabin as per the crew.  Upon check in we were move to the back side on the aircraft not the seats we booked. The food was not good as well and too far in between for a 12hr flight, the crew was helpful but not regularly offering drinks /snacks not sure if that is the new standard. Meals was served less than 1hr before landing and the crew was rushing the meals. Upon arrival at Singapore a delay on our bags, so we had to wait and check at the airport longer just to get some clarification. They didn't know where our bags are and just informed us that it will be delivered home. Once my baggage was delivered, my luggage was damaged and unusable wheels caved in and the fragile sticker gone. "

Going flight on 14 April 2023 SQ929 SUB-SIN, the departure from Surabaya was delayed. When arrived in Changi Airport, we could not get on our flight to Haneda, and our flights were changed to Narita. The airport change caused longer travel time (from Haneda to home is less than 1 hour but from Narita is more than 2 hours) and cost (from Haneda is about 500 yen but from Narita is about 4500 yen). Return flight on 16 April 2023, SQ631 HND-SIN flight arrival to Changi Airport was delayed. While we could make it to connection flight to Surabaya, our luggage could not. We were disappointed with Singapore Airlines."

Flight uneventful, with comfy seat, good service, stable Wi-Fi and decent entertainment. Food quality and presentation rather poor.  Transit in SG uneventful with crowded lounge with average food offerings. The food on the short sector to BKK was so much better than the flight from Paris to Singapore."

The world class hospitality as the latest TV advertisement claims is sadly missing. The warmth, friendliness, cheerfulness, the unique character and personality of Singapore Airlines was not there. There were no disposable wet wipes provided when we boarded the plane. The first meal took fairly long before it was served. Between meals, crew would be walking up and down the aisle with water, drinks and snacks but I did not see this. On our return flight on SQ282, the crew did offer a few rounds of orange juice and water but no snacks. They did not offer toiletries pack. Whether I would recommend this airline, depends on the price point at the time of booking in comparison to other airlines out there. The whole experience felt like a very regular, no fuss airline experience. "

Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Singapore,March 2023,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,2,"  There were no manned counters available for economy class at all. Even 2.5 hours before the flight, no staff were available to assist us and staff in Perth airport were not familiar with the self check in kiosk issues. We took a good 2 hours to resolve our check in issues as there was a long line of people waiting in line as all of us had issues checking in via the online kiosks. There were only 2 staff walking around who arrived only 2 hours before flight. We were juggling the queue, our toddler, baggage and when we finally printed our boarding pass, we had to lug everything and our toddler who was cranky at this point from all the waiting and standing and queueing and then self check in our baggage one at a time. It was the worst service ever. Also the captain announced that there will be no wifi for that flight. "

✅ Trip Verified ,A359,Business,Economy Class,Bangkok to Singapore,March 2023,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,,1.0,1,no,1," The sector was the first leg of a Bangkok to Paris business class ticket. I received a call from SQ a day prior to departure requesting a voluntary downgrade due to last minute aircraft change and not having enough business class seats. I was told that I would receive S$ 200 plus a same sector upgrade voucher. I agreed and I was told that I would receive an email shortly with the details; which was never sent. Upon check-in, I was told that it was an error, that I would receive either the cash or the voucher. I opted for the cash, since I had no use for the sector upgrade. At the gate, I received a letter that there would be a fare difference compensation, which, in my case exceeded the S$ 200. After having three compensation versions, I approached the purser of the flight who told me that the payment would be $200 and another $ 200. (Version number 4). She also told me that she would mention my case in n her flight report and asked for my email address. She told me that I would be contacted shortly, which never happened. I also wrote in to SQ with no response received. I am not trying to get something out of this, but I do not appreciate being treated like a fool. The flight itself was rather mediocre with SQs new concept of tiny portions in a cardboard box, which does not work for me. The few spoons of lukewarm tasteless Laksa in a cardboard box was probably one of the worst economy food ever. The seat/aircraft was good and comfortable."

First international flight since covid. Two things stand out - as expected, Singapore Airlines were up to their usual high standards with requests, check-in, seating and efficient, friendly cabin service. Despite aircraft being full, a polite request for preferred seating afforded us seats near bulkheads or in exit rows - making the longer sectors far more pleasant with the extra legroom. Flights departed on time, cabin and toilets kept clean at all times. The 2nd issue of significance was that one of my 2 baggage items was nowhere to be seen upon arrival in BKK. This was at a time when all airlines were ramping up after covid and many were having issues with misplaced, lost or late baggage. In fairness to SQ, the item was ""oversize"" and handled separately AND we had a tight connection of only 1 hour in SIN. It was reported to staff and next morning I received an email saying the smallish item had been located. I received a phone call and then another email updating me of the delayed baggage and that it would be delivered to my home 100km from BKK airport by courier - and it DID arrive as promised !. Excellent communication and service. It was apparent the item had missed the connecting flight in Singapore - as evidenced by the ""rush"" stickers etc all over the article.. Singapore Airlines - a cut above the others."

It was an absolute delight being served by her, she was friendly, helpful but at all times very professional. The only disappointing issue on the flight was the food which was of a poor quality and tasteless. The onward flight from Singapore was good but again the food on this flight was dreadful. My overall thoughts on this journey were very positive other than food and on that basis I have already booked again for later in the year."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Amsterdam to Brisbane via Singapore,February 2023,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,2," I booked an economy ticket from Amsterdam to Brisbane via Singapore. I upgraded my seat because of health issues. When I upgraded my seat from Amsterdam to Brisbane I was charged 3.958 euros for the upgrade of my flight from Amsterdam to Brisbane. My husband also upgraded his seat from Amsterdam to Singapore on the same flight and was charged 1.217 euros. Singapore Airlines decided to overbook the flight. When I arrived in Singapore I found out that my seat was given to someone else. I could not fly business class to Brisbane. They gave me me an economy seat. The service was very slow and unprofessional. I asked about the refund. Only 10 days later after sending several emails to Singapore airlines, requesting more information regarding the refund, they told me I would receive a refund of only 1.545 euros. When I upgraded my seat from Amsterdam to Brisbane I was charged 3.958 euros for the upgrade. My husband also upgraded his seat from Amsterdam to Singapore on the same flight and was charged 1.217 euros. Based on these fees, I expected a refund of 2.741 euros (3.958 - 1.217). I believe that customers who are affected by this issue deserve a quick and a fair and reasonable refund. The offer I received does not meet this standard. On top of this: When I arrived in Brisbane, my luggage had not arrived. They told me the luggage would arrive in the next plain , the next morning at 7.00 O’clock. They would make sure my luggage would arrive at my accommodation the same afternoon. When I phoned to get more information I could not reach any one. I send several emails and received no reply. After numerous phone calls I finally spoke to someone. He told me that my luggage would not be delivered that same afternoon (although it had actually arrived that morning at 7:00 in the morning. It took a lot of other phone calls before they had my luggage delivered that evening."

Boarding, crew, food, seat, Wi-Fi, drinks, all of it. This cabin crew was amazing and managed to be sincere while also being efficient.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Singapore,January 2023,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  The ground crew were unreasonable and very rude.

✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Singapore to London,December 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,5,yes,9,"  We flew LHR - SIN and SIN- LHR in December. Both flights were the morning A380 flights in Premium Economy. So we’ve had best part of 27 hours experiencing the Premium Economy product. Boarding for both flights was painless. Both flights left on time and arrived slightly early. The premium economy cabin on the A380 is right at the front and as such feels quite exclusive. Indeed there are only about 40 seats in the cabin in a 2-4-2 configuration. To keep this review brief. The seats were a major upgrade on the usual economy seats both in comfort and space. The food was lovely - we used Book the Cook for all our meals. Plenty of drinks brought around and if you needed a top up or a snack this was provided promptly. Again on both flights the cabin crew were amazingly good. We paid about £600 each extra over and above the economy fare, which at the time of booking meant our premium economy fare was double the economy fare. So an extra £300 each way to be in Premium Economy. Is it worth it? Well yes it is , but I add a proviso. It’s worth paying extra, as long as the extra you pay is no more than around £600-£700 for long haul return. £600 economy vs £1200 Premium, that a no brainer. If you have the cash then do it. But £600 economy and £1600 Premium, then I’d personally say that’s too much for what you get"
Not Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bengaluru to Seattle via Singapore,January 2023,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Singapore Airlines is by far the best airline I have flown it. The cabin is a spacious 3-3-3 layout in it's Economy Class with excellent mood lighting. The cabins lack individual air vents and can make it uncomfortable sometimes. Food was average and the portions were not great. However, the cabin crew do everything from serving snacks like sandwiches, cup ramen, chips, cookies, etc. to the passengers from time to time with water and beverages. Hospitality was five-star. From the welcome at the door, the crew help out passengers with a smile. Given that they work for hours together on some ultra-long haul flights and with a wide of array of passengers onboard, it is amazing to see them help you with a smile, always. In seat entertainment had a lot of options and can easily entertain any person, young or old, on a 17 hour flight. In all, the experience was great and I would recommend SQ to everyone."

Booked a long haul flight. Even though it's almost 17 hour flight, but didn't feel like one, when my journey ended I was as fresh as when I boarded the flight. Silverkris lounge at Changi Airport was good. They have sleeping pods as well as a bathroom, where you can take a shower, in case you feel like one. Food was amazing. They have the facility called - ""Book a Cook"", which I'd used for getting my Steak. (Attached the pic), it was so delicious and perfect as if I'm dining in a restaurant. Crew were polite and very helpful. Only drawback that I find is - at New York (JFK Airport), they don't have a nice lounge. Lounges, they have partnered with were so small and didn't have a nice quick bite / snacks or drinks. Wish they could do something about it. All in all, must admit, Singapore Airline is the best airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Toronto via Incheon,January 2023,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,1.0,1,no,1," I miss the pre-pandemic Singapore Airlines. I have flown with them on a regular basis for decades and am disappointed at how bad the first flight I took with them since the pandemic was. My flight was purchased from Air Canada and AC is the first marketing carrier as per US DOT rules. AC is also the most significant carrier. I have clearly researched my baggage allocation prior to the trip and packed appropriately. Unfortunately, the SIA check in staff were clearly unaware of their own company's baggage policy (see pictures below) and refused to allow me to check my three bags. I had to repack my bags at the airport, which is both embarrassing and a complete hassle. I have never had to do this in my decades of leisure and business travel. I will definitely think twice before taking a flight with SIA again in the future."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Ho Chi Minh to Singapore,January 2023,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,,3.0,2,no,5," Was this a memorable flight? Not really. I like the entertainment selection. The seat was fine for just over a 2 hr flight on SQ177. Actually not much different to the 350-900 medium haul except maybe the adjoining two seats in the middle are closer. The food. Oh my. Dreadful. Sounded great, lemongrass chicken. It was very fatty and unpleasant. The bok choy was almost raw. I would have preferred a plateful of the garlic bread instead of the tiny slice I was given. All in all it was a very average experience. I miss the Singapore Airlines pre Covid and really think they need to up their game in the food area especially. I booked this flight as at the time it was actually cheaper to go to HCMC via Singapore than just to Singapore. However, I wish I booked through Vietnam Airlines and saved money and connection hassles."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Melbourne,January 2023,2.0,5.0,,,,2.0,3,no,7," Overall an ok flight. Lounge - SilverKris Changi is huge and was too over crowded. We had to sit at a canteen type table which was uncomfortable. We only stayed long enough to change our sim and change clothes. Way too busy. Gate/Boarding. We got in line. Was told there was no point as it hadn’t opened. We stayed in line as seats get taken in there fast. Boarding passes are scanned after security which meant the one gate agent could not cope when it was boarding time and everyone stormed the gate not adhering to groups or priority. Seat - narrow. Overhead lockers were too high for me to reach even with the little foot aid thing. Others had to help. No other storage except under the foot rest. There is a tiny cubby hole where ear phones, menu and water bottle were kept. Not a comfortable seat to sleep in being so narrow with no wriggle room. Hard being a side sleeper. Food - As all my other flights had poor quality food I opted for no meal, just sleep. The passenger in front argued with the FA over no breakfast service. Personally I believe there should have been a choice but no. The lovely FA verified no meal with me and offered to keep cheesecake aside that she would serve to me with coffee when I woke which was lovely of her. As I woke an hour or so before landing she was right there with what was promised. On arrival luggage arrived quickly so we were one of the first through customs with no long line. Overall the crew really are the highlight with Singapore Airlines. The rest is average to below average with definite cut backs evident. Also disappointed that when I booked this flight it was for the 777 which has better seats for sleep but that changed to the less than comfortable 350-900 medium haul."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to New York,January 2023,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,4.0,4,yes,10,"  This is the best airline I have ever been on. The lounge before flight was amazing, the service was quick and the people were kind. On my flight from Singapore to New York , one stewardess specifically, Belle, made my 19 hour long trip with my brother an absolute delight. She was attentive, kind, and went above and beyond. When I asked if I could skip the appetizer meal (since it was a food I generally do not like) she asked if I would like fruit instead to replace it. She also would always quickly and kindly help me make my seat into a bed! (The seat form was a 8/10 for comfort but the bed was SOOO nice I slept for most the flight). This was the first time I had ever traveled Business class and I felt like royalty.  Even the bathroom was nice with amenities like a hairbrush. My one feedback for improvement would be to automatically give things that are included (I had to ask for slippers and mask on my flight from Singapore to NY but it was laid out from NY there) but even that was still good. While the wifi isn't strong enough for videos, it was good for surfing the internet which is what I used it for, and I charged my phone so I left with full battery."
Not Verified ,A359,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Auckland to Singapore,February 2022,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,9,"  A thoroughly pleasant experience, bearing in mind this flight was during the height of Covid-19 and New Zealand had just reopened its borders. Check-in was a bit truncated, given the amount of documentation required and the person managing our check-in was receiving training. Once on board the experience was delightful, food and beverage service was lovely, including signature Singapore Slings. The A350 was very clean, and I particularly like the additional screen on the handset. Legroom was adequate, though better than many others; that said, the flight only had 75 passengers, so my wife and I had a row to ourselves."
Not Verified ,Boeing 777/300,Family Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Auckland,January 2023,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1,no,1,"  Disappointing flight from Singapore to Auckland. A good seat, tasteless food and the worst Illy coffee i have had. What concerned me the most is the cost we paid for these flights, this one one of four flights we took on Singapore airlines over the last three weeks. The Auckland to Singapore flights seemed understaffed, whereas the Singapore to Bangkok flights seemed a lot more organised and a better food selection. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City,December 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,2.0,2,no,5,"  The flight seemed quite full with huge line up at the gate security area. No priority line but that’s ok. Boarding was odd with just a gate agent yelling out instructions. The seat was fine but no bottle of water which was disappointing. We used book the cook. My husbands beef cheek was tender but my steak was too tough to cut or even bite into. The crew were lovely but disorganised. The right side of the plane were offered bread after the meal not before. My side missed out entirely. Arriving at Ho Chi Minh city, no priority line for immigration. Never mind. It was a 5/10 flight. Nothing special."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denpasar to Amsterdam via Singapore,November 2022,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,,1.0,1,no,4,"  They cancel our flight and push us to an 8h earlier flight, and notify us last minute by calling us internationally about the change. Their customer service put us on hold for more than half of the 25 minute call, something that could have been done online for free, but they found it necessary to call. They even didn't offer food and beverage vouchers to cover the extra 8h on Singapore Airport. Their ground staff was sending us from one side to the other without a solution. After trying to get in touch with them it took 1.5 month to get a reply saying they don't care. Also transfer was unclear as the gates were closed until very close to departure. My inflight food was very bad, and in-flight service almost non-existent. You had to go to the kitchen area to ask for some drinks. In-flight entertainment was good with many recent movies. I will never fly again with Singapore Airlines after this."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Melbourne to Singapore,December 2022,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,4.0,3,yes,7," Full flight. Check in was busy, business class full. The lounge in Melbourne was okay, bit old and dated but the food was good. Boarding protocol was strictly adhered to. We were warmly welcomed. This medium haul aircraft was far different to the A380 in business. The seats although adequate were so much smaller. I was surprised to see not only a blanket and pillow but slippers, face mask, socks and amenity kit on my seat. The storage bin overhead is very high up and 158cm me needed help to stow my bag. Not much storage at the seat, just under the footstool and a tiny cubby hole once the headphones and water are removed. The staff were very friendly but reactive rather than pro active. They didn’t check the cabin during the flight but would respond to pushing the button for an attendant. The food was okay. Nothing special, steak was tough but the dessert was lovely (cheesecake). Entertainment was pretty good, quite a lot of choice, and the flight map was excellent. The refreshment before landing was not nice, chorizo and pasta. Quantity not quality. We arrived slightly sooner than scheduled. Altogether it was good for a day flight but not sure it will be comfortable enough for an overnight flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Brisbane to Singapore,December 2022,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,1.0,4,yes,7," Check in at Brisbane was the worst we have ever experienced. There is only one business class counter, which resulted in a 30 +minute queue. On taking this up with the duty manager I was told this is to push passengers to use the check in machine and deal with their own luggage. Fine for passengers familiar with the system, but not acceptable for passengers who predate the automated era, and certainly not acceptable having paid for business class. Having finally checked in it was another disappointment to discover that Brisbane Airport has abolished fast track security. Obviously an airport decision but it begs the question, as a major user of Brisbane, have Singapore Airlines put any pressure on the airport to reintroduce this facility. The lounge had a good selection of food Once the flight boarded it was back to the excellent service we expect. So unfortunate that a good flight was spoiled by an awful start - the business class experience should begin on first arrival at the airport."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Paris via Singapore,December 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1, What a shame. Delayed baggage when I arrived at the Paris airport. The representative told me that it would be sent the next day. I arrived on Thursday evening and it is now Saturday evening and I have not seen my luggage. Neither received any calls from anyone. I don't know where is my luggage and I am left waiting for it at home. Even low cost airline provide a better customer service support. I have no idea why it is cited as among the best airlines. It is not even Top 20 in my book. Was my first time flying with this airline and it will be the last.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Sydney to Singapore,October 2022,1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,,3.0,3,no,5," Seat 32A could not be reclined so it defeated the purpose of paying extra for premium economy for a comfortable seat. Seat 32C took so much effort to force it to recline. The buttons did not seem to do anything. I had to push to force it to recline. My Singapore Sling was overly sweet and it felt it was made deliberately to avoid asking for a second one. No warm towels and a small packet of nuts given quite a while after the drinks service was completed. There was a great movies/tv selection. The noise cancelling headphones were the large ear encompassing ones. Two small bottles of water were sitting in between the seats. When we boarded at the appropriate announcement time based on sections, our cabin was full so most people had boarded earlier. The economy class cabin had many empty seats. On reflection, had I had knowledge of seat bookings, I would have opted for economy. Premium class was not delivered. I asked for an amenity bag and the flight attendant looked at me puzzled, as though one such a thing did not exist. Reluctantly an economy class bag with just socks and toothbrush was procured. Food was same as economy although I pre-ordered mine. No dessert on the tray but a small tub of Hagen Daez ice cream. It seems they were anxious to get meal service done as quickly as possible. The flight attendants were friendly on boarding but we hardly saw them after the meal service. No mid-flight snacks. Plane left and arrived on time. Overall I will seriously reconsider premium economy."

Pretty well can't be faulted. E.g. the airline staff went the extra mile in several respects, including luggage which didn't make a tight connection, but which I still got in 24 hours. The A350s are somewhat more comfortable in feel than even the A380s, the IFE on both aircraft is good, though the A350s have a live BBC news feed I can recommend. Would happily fly with them again."

Boarding started late and was chaos, with no real explanation about the delay. Upon boarding could not use the overhead above my seat, and was not allowed to have any personal items. There was a Headphone shortage. Took off, and inflight service started rather late. Cabin attendants speaking extremely fast, and I was unable to comprehend what they were saying. Multiple times, Had to ask them to slow down. They ran out of food. Offered Entrée was disgusting, and I refused. They came back, and tried to offer me the Business Class entrée, but there was only 1 choice. I passed, but they hounded me with endless questions. Landed, and couldn’t get access to my luggage. Singapore Airlines is only good on Ultra Long Haul flights. With Asian connections not anymore, since they got rid of the A330. "

They tried their best to fulfil requests.

The cabin crew were excellent and made regular drinks runs throughout the flight with trays of water, juice and sometimes beer. I was impressed by their professionalism, politeness and friendliness throughout the journey, despite having to serve almost a full flight. Flood (including snacks in between meals at the galley) was plentiful, even for economy class. Two free hours of wifi for economy class passengers was a welcome addition to the service. Everything went smoothly, from boarding to disembarking. Prior to the flight I had called the call centre to make a booking amendment and the service from the call centre was also efficient."

Syd-Sin-Cph (Oct 6, 2022) was excellent. Of course in Economy we were packed like sardines, but the tin was large enough (and neighbours small enough) that we weren't particularly uncomfortable. This is the third time we've flown post-Covid. The first time on Thai it seemed that Covid was the excuse to give no service at all but Singapore Airlines both at Xmas 2021 and last month provides excellent service. Food was very good and alcohol plentiful. The entertainment system provided enough to occupy us for this long haul. Flight attendants were very attentive. We stopped over in Singapore on our way home. Unfortunately Sin-Syd leaves shortly after midnight. The flight was delayed and it was after 1am before we left. This is a long time between meals and we were uncertain whether we'd be given a snack and night cap before going to sleep but no announcement was made and we stayed in limbo between sleeping and waking for most of this leg. Of the four legs of our journey this is our only complaint."

Check in fast, with agent verifying information. Boarding was quick. Upon boarding a Red Uniformed Cabin Attendant welcomed me aboard, and directed me to my seat. As I passed others they acknowledged me and welcomed me aboard. One even said “Happy Thanksgiving”. Aircraft seemed extremely cold, and rather uncomfortable. We seemed to be late pushing back, and The Red Uniformed staff was going around talking to passengers. She approached me, and began to engage in conversation. She thanked me for flying SQ for 14 years. Finally we Took off. I had to use the provided blanket. Champagne is back on the menu. When they arrived with Dinner, they ran out of food, so the Steward said he had to go to Business to get entrees. He came back and said what he had. I ordered the Beef. He kept checking in, with estimated time of completion. Constant Champagne rounds followed through the flight. After dinner I slept. Standalone seat extremely comfortable, and excellent value. Second meal came out. I had the Stir Fry Shrimp which was Delicious. Constant Champagne refills continued. On approach to Changi, I switched to Coffee, which also continued with multiple rounds. Arriving in SIN on Thanksgiving morning, crew wished us well as we debarked. I have been flying with Singapore Airlines since 2008. This flight maybe the best experience I have ever had with them!!!"

I had to ask for a drink because the service  walked by multiple times ignoring me. I flew with them 4 times, two flights of 14.5 hours plus 2 shorter flights on 1 out of 4 flights, I can say that the service was at a high level. The seats were super uncomfortable. The number of drinks served for 14.5 hours is really poor. The last drink I asked for was water, and the staff brought me a tap water. "

Similarly the lounge was busy. There was a decent selection of food, but the wine on offer was disappointing. Boarding was prompt with a friendly welcome, and champagne and fruit juice on offer before take off. Drinks were served immediately after take off, and it seemed that most passengers opted for sleep rather than food. The seats are very comfortable for sitting and relaxing, but in the lie flat position the recess for the feet is restricting. There were four breakfast type food options available, to be served immediately or before landing, which made a lot of sense, but the Continental breakfast was very basic and disappointing. Brisbane airport was very quiet early morning, and immigration and luggage delivery very quick. Overall it was a good flight, and the cabin crew were excellent, as expected on Singapore Airlines."

Upon calling back a few days later after checking that my flight has not been booked over the website, the agent over the phone tried to salvage the situation by insisting that my original flight change booking flight was cancelled and instead, I now would have to pay SGD 1700 to rebook the flight change. There was no such cancellation of flights as the flight number of the ""cancelled"" flight was the exact same flight as the one that he proposed. I tried calling on multiple occasions and even though Singapore Airlines admitted their fault for messing up my booking, they would not change my flight at the original price that was agreed upon. As a result, I had to miss my other travel plans to London.  My main issues are these: 1) After rushing me to confirm the flight changes before 21st April, which I did on 20th April, why was the flight not booked at the original agreed price of SGD 300. Is it a lack of competence that your staff can't operate a computer? "

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to London via Singapore,August 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,,3.0,1,no,1,"  We flew the SQ 322 flight from Singapore to London Heathrow on Tuesday 2nd august 2022 arriving at London Heathrow at 6am. When we got on the flight the seat part of my daughters seat was missing. She was seated in 54k next to the window. Somebody came and replaced it so she could sit down. We all fell asleep immediately as it was almost 1am in the morning Sydney time. Half way through the flight my daughter realised her socks were wet. We had a look at them and realised they stank of vomit. We then checked all of her toys and our bags that were on the floor and they were all damp and stank of vomit. All of her things, shoes, socks and bottom of her trousers just absolutely stank of vomit and the ground was soaking wet. I can not believe that after such a terrible pandemic my daughter was allowed to sit in an area where someone had so obviously recently been vomiting. Not to mention how disgusting it has been travelling to our hotel in a car with bags all covered in sick and smelling absolutely terrible. I complained to the air steward and asked her to make a note as it was such a disgusting way to have to sit on a long haul flight. Our short UK holiday absolutely ruined, not being able to see my terminally ill father for 8 days in fear of passing it to him, which his immune system could not have handled. This after not seeing him due to the pandemic for 3 years! I understand we flew economy, but at the very least we expected the seats to be clean and sanitary. I emailed the airline through my husbands official Singapore Airlines account, and we heard nothing. I emailed several times, nothing. I only got a response from the airline when I involved a third party resolver government site that helps consumers. They told me nothing had been reported, and that the airline staff deny this even happened. So at the very least they are not logging and recording the changing of seats which must be a safety issue. I find very hard to believe the air steward doesn't remember covering the vomit floor with a blanket and spraying air freshener over it for us. I also asked her to log it all, and she said she would. The airline said all the attendants had been interviewed but they all deny this even happened. It's not so much what happened, it is more the absolute denial that it even took place."

Lounge access was the Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse, which at that time of day seemed to be devoted to SQ passengers. Lounge service was excellent, with a good selection of food and drinks. Boarding was on time and very efficient, with a personalised welcome on board.. settling in was very easy, as there is so much storage available at the seat and above. Pre take off drinks were offered, but only fruit juice and water, no champagne. No amenity kits offered except by request. Food and drink orders were taken immediately after take off, and serve with sosatie appetisers. Meals were served not long after with a varied choice of mains. Book the Cook is not available ex Johannesburg, and also whilst it is possible to preview the menu, it is not possible to order. Not a problem for us, as we were near the front. Decent wines were on offer, although a somewhat limited choice. Food was good, as was the service. The seat is very comfortable and notably wider than most. Flor sleeping it is necessary to fold down the backrest to create the bed, which is easily done, although attendants were quick to help. The drawback to the bed is a small cubbyhole for the feet offset from the bed, although in use this was not a particular problem, and wwe both slept for most of the flight. Breakfast was offered as and when people woke, and arrival in Singapore on time. As usual immigration was a breeze. Our only downside was we found the entertainment system difficult, but this is probably an age thing. Overall a very good flight"

I was told to proceed to the boarding gate for service. After one hour of waiting in a queue, several people including me were finally get their passes. While we were lining up, many travellers (probably first and business class) cut the queue to insist on going to the aircraft first.  From what I feel, they need a bigger crew to service the A380. Staff avoided eye contact with me to speed up their service. Food was not ready for the first meal. I had to wait half an hour for my main meal after finishing everything else. I was not offered a drink and when I asked, they signalled me to wait. I waited for another half an hour without any drink from the crew yet the guy two rows in front of me asked for a refill and was offered immediately. Second meal was a total disaster, it took an hour for our cabin to be served. To the point that, many people who were already served, they expected their trays to be cleared but nothing happened and many people took the matters into their own hands by bringing trays to cabin crew. Drinks were offered and served very minimally. I can confidently say it because my second flight later with an A350, it was a joy again. Everything ran on time. Polite and civilized boarding. No late service. I still can feel a drop in service as compared to pre-pandemic time."

Meals ordered online and were tasty and well presented with plentiful beer, wines and spirits offered with them and during the flight - possible a little too enthusiastically. The cabin crew were friendly and efficient and made the flights very pleasant indeed. You do need to ask for amenity kits and slippers if you want them and the absence of an offer of hot towels was initially disappointing but a plentiful supply was discovered in the wash rooms for self-serve. The lie-flat beds were made up by the crew if you showed any hesitation in figuring out how they worked and were comfortable once you became used to the idea of sleeping on a bed where the lower half was offset to the upper half. Cabin WiFi worked OK and the IFE seemed to have a reasonable selection, although eating and sleeping were my preferred options on the overnight flights.

Best Economy Class !, spacious seats with nice legroom, pleasing color fabric on seat covers. Each seat had a pillow and a blanket. You should ask to offer you an amenity kit (with socks, eye cover, toothbrush / paste). Pity they do not have inflight magazine due to covid (same excuse to save money and weight, a lot of airlines are using the same excuse). Both flights were on perfect A350 and on time. After takeoff they started the first service which was tasty and there was selection of wine, beer, drinks. After food was desert which was an icecream. During flight the crew was passing by the bottle of water for the passengers. At the galley there were some sandwiches and drinks. In the WC there were toothbrushes, cologne and cream. One hour before landing the second meal was served which was as good and plentiful as the first. IFE was great with a good selection of movies and easy to use. Great airline, keep the good work."

IFE finally got upgraded, and the A380s fixed shellback seat was extremely comfortable. Upon taking off I dozed off, and was waken up by Cabin Crew to close my window shade.

I requested Chicken for dinner, and the Gentleman said he had to come back. 15 minutes later, I hit the call button, and when the young lady I arrived, I explained to her I did not receive dinner. Finally the Gentleman returned, apologized, and ensured dinner would be out shortly, which it was. Followed by a second round of drinks. Woke up to a refreshment, of extremely small Sandwich of sorts, and a quick round of drinks. Arrived at FRA, and off to my connection.

Neither of the above are consistent with the airline’s advertised offer. The were no masks/socks offered. The A380 Premium Economy seats are much poorer design compared to the A350 seat in the same class/airline. Hard vinyl covered seats, impossible to get comfortable in.

However the seat space felt slightly cramped and the seats weren’t very comfy. I feel like the lower back support isn’t very good and this makes you sit in a position that is uncomfortable. I say this both for the A350 & A380. I am comparing this to my last journey with Singapore on an older 777-300ER, which in my opinion feels more spacious and the seats feel i lot less cramped. Also the lower back support is better. The meals, are okay by all means but when i compare this to Emirates or Qatar, they are very basic in the sense that all you get is a main dish, bread, crackers, cheese and a small desert of some kind. Nothing to shout about considering this is a top airline. The crew, outstanding on all flights I've been on, friendly and you can take your water bottle and keep filling it up. If you want a drink at any point you can go up and ask.  Transit, probably one of the easiest airports to transit through. A pleasant experience, and if you have in excess of 4 hours you can occupy yourself with plenty.

Good attitude of flight attendants. Long answer. The last time I flew SQ was back in 2006 and do remember that it was a very pleasant flight. Since then mostly have been flying Qatar, Emirates, Turkish and many EU/American airlines. First impression, the ambiance of the aircraft is very unpleasant when comparing it to Emirates or Qatar. IFE is small screen with limited choices. No amenity kit of any sort - zero. There was a blanket and a pillow though. One of the toilet from LA to Singapore was closed with an Out of Order note on it, so basically keep waiting for your turn. Food quality is really terrible compared to Emirates/Qatar. No salad or fruit. During the flight no water service. I am used to sitting on 15 hour Dubai flights but never get such pain as this time on Singapore. It is basically now a budget airline but with a 5 star price tag. Even the business class seats look tired and dated. Won't recommend unless you have no choice."

In addition the entertainment system was bizarre — if you aren’t a fan of Tom Cruise or superheroes you are out of luck. Seriously, there was nothing to watch. Could not comment on the dinner as we chose to eat in the airport. Breakfast was okay for an economy class meal but coffee was not good. I paid a substantial premium for this and I am not impressed.

The new booking provided was horrible. I was travelling with my four-year-old and the new seat provided is far away, and we were separated. All the family members are separated for the whole journey. Miscommunication between the crew members made us to walk between the terminals for 2 times. Didn't get any help from the crew, even though we requested to provide a seat together."

In the flight, I was not served with the chosen special meals, and asked the flight attendant to check. She said that all special meals has been handed out.  I had to write a email via the help section to double confirm what's the reason behind this. I was told via email that special meal was not able to be catered on the said flight due to insufficient preparation time. Truly disappointed with these behavior. There is no inflight entertainment for 2.5 hours flight, and the standard inflight meal is small in portion. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Munich via Singapore ,August 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I booked all my flights through the Singapore Airline website.  My flight from Edinburgh to Germany (LH965) with Lufthansa booked by Singapore Air was delayed which meant I missed the next 2 connecting flights Frankfurt - Singapore (SQ2151) and Singapore - Sydney (SQ325). I understand things like this happen and with hopes of being put on the next available flight I tried to let it not bother me I arrived at the airport no one with Singapore Air was there to help so I spoke with Lufthansa who put me in a hotel for the night which was nice but didn’t have any aircon in 40 degreases heat. I was told that Singapore Air would be in contact during the night when their customer service team opened to put me on the next flight. I was up most of the night anxiously waiting for the message of my next flight in case I missed it I was on an online chat with someone who said “I will help now” but then would just end the chat. I decided to head to the airport as it was now around 9 am with no contact by anyone and I had a wedding to make on Friday the 5th. I arrived at the airport and no one cared and didn’t even want to give me the time of day. Singapore Air said it was Lufthansa’s fault and Lufthansa said it was Singapore Air’s fault the walk time to each desk was around 15-20 mins and I was back and forth with everyone sending me to random desks for 3 hours. I was told there were no flights for 3-4 days and there was nothing I can do and it was my responsibility to pay for the time I’d need to spend in Germany, I’m a solo female aged 25 and was even refused to receive my case so had no clothes to wear.  I checked Skyscanner and there were flights leaving that day, at this point, I had enough and went to the business class desk and demanded that I be put on this next flight that I repeatedly lied to that had no space.I was finally helped by someone and was easily put on the flight. Obviously, the extra leg room seats were taken which was understandable so I need to receive a refund for this. "
Not Verified ,A350-900,Family Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Amsterdam,August 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5,yes,10,  Great flight! I arrived yesterday morning in Amsterdam after an almost 13 hours trip from Singapore with my wife and small son. Flying in the business class of Singapore airlines was an amazing experience. The seat is very convenient. In the night the crew prepares a bed for you which was fine. I ordered before the flight the lobster which was absolutely delicious. The service during the flight was great. The crew was very nice to my son and us. The breakfast was also ok. All in all this was one of the best flight experiences ever for me! Amazing flight and service!

I selected it and I was able to have the seat with no extra charge. I was pleased with the ground handling, service and quality of food. The Laksa was very delicious! The flight was on-time and the in-flight entertainment was top-notch! One thing that was not working is the Wi-Fi as I was only able to use it for a few minutes. I will definitely fly with Singapore Airlines again."

Granted that the departure and arrival times were very good, and my seat was comfortable. Gone are the warms towels prior to your meal, no menu cards and no water runs through the flight. Then there was the lunch service, the bread roll was more like a brick - when asking the flight attendant if I could have another one he replied that they were all like that. No entree /dessert on  meal tray. Breakfast was served 5 hours prior to landing and my meal was very poor in quantity and quality."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737max,Business,Economy Class,Kolkata to Singapore,April 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Smooth check-in and outstanding service at the airport. The red-eye flight was delayed by 1,5 hour and at the gate SQ organised a buffet where one could get a hot meal, able to choose between vegetarian on with chicken. It was a very nice touch, was really impressed (especially comparing it to what you don't get from other airlines in similar circumstances). After boarding, very welcoming crew and for those still hungry there was the normal meal service with a round of drinks."

Nice hot meal as per the new concept for short flight with SQ. Long layover in SIN, could visit the new Silverkris Lounge and then onwards on SQ's new 737max. Very comfortable plane, nice interacting crew and lovely dinner served, watching a good movie on their in flight entertainment!"
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777 / A350,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Jakarta via Singapore,January 2022,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,5.0,4,yes,8,"  SQ is one of my favorite airlines, but unfortunately in-cabin experience is less. Still great inflight entertainment (among the best in the industry) but food service is being downgraded.  The round of drinks before dinner/lunch on longer flights, the appetizer on the tray and the hot towel upon boarding are gone. Of course nothing really serious, but with what you pay extra to fly with SQ it is an issue. Check-in process in FRA was efficient (as always with SQ) and the transit in SIN was a little tedious, as Germany (origin of my journey) was Covid-listed again: therefore it was not permitted to ""walk freely around"" the airport in January 2022 and I had to wait for my connection in a ""reserved quarantine area"". On the shorter flight to JKT you get now a box with (very) hot food, which is a downgrade compared to what you got before but still is quite ok. On both flights crew was very friendly and interactive."
✅ Trip Verified ,A359/Boeing787,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Istanbul to Bangkok via Singapore,August 2022,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,2,no,4,"  Checkin in Istanbul fast and efficient. Turkish Airlines lounge just amazing; something SQ could learn from looking at its „upgraded“ new Krisflyer Lounge in Terminal 3 in Singapore. Boarding in Istanbul was well organized. Seat spacious and comfortable. Food decent, but unfortunately no Book the Cook service ex Istanbul. The big negative point of this flight was the service. Painfully slow, but still hectic and robotic. The lunch service took almost 3 hours. It took an hour from the Satay serving till the appetizer was served. No dining on demand like the ME carrier. Out of the 10.5h flight, almost half of the time was spent with meals. What happened to the previously famous Singapore girl? SQ service does not have the perfection of Qatar, nor the efficiency of LH. Krisflyer lounge in Singapore was so crowded that I left after a while. Shorter flight from Singapore to BKK was uneventful, with a faster service, but still robotic impersonal service."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Singapore,July 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,yes,9,"  The aircraft used for this short 2 hour flight is the regional business class configuration with 1-2-1 layout. For solo travellers, the window seat is the best option and is arranged in an alternating manner with seats next to the window and next to the aisle respectively. The problem with the seat next to the window is that the winglet of the seat partially obscures the window so you will have to lean forward to look out of the window. On this morning flight I ordered Nasi Lemak for breakfast and it was delicious. Cabin crew were attentive and even for such a short flight the leading stewardess addressed me by name. Overall it was a pleasant flight even though I only had 20 minutes to lie flat before preparation for landing in Singapore."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800 Max,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Phuket,July 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I flew on the new business class product of SQ on their narrow body B737-800 Max to Phuket last month. The new product featured a fully flat reclining seat in a 1-2-1 configuration. For a 90 minute flight, I had a dinner of beef steak which was booked through the Book the Cook service. As expected with steaks on airline menus, the steak was a bit too well done for my taste. As it was a short flight, it was time to descend after the dinner service. I didn’t get to try out the full recline of the seat but it was comfortable with generous pitch in lounge mode. I would definitely recommend the B737-800 Max business class product for regional routes on SQ especially on the longer regional flights of 4-5 hours where you can get a short nap in full bed mode."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brisbane to Singapore,July 2022,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,1.0,4,no,5,"  I flew with Singapore Airlines from Brisbane to Greece recently and they lost my luggage. The suitcase was returned to me at the end of my holidays (3 weeks later) and caused me to have to change holidays plans, lots of frustration trying to reach someone form the company and incurred unexpected expenses as I landed with no personal belongings. I've sent two separate feedback forms and there has been no reply and when I managed to finally reach someone from their call centre service, they did not know how to help me and put me on hold for half an hour. This is ridiculous customer service for a company which is supposed to be among the best in the world. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City,July 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,no,4,"  Our family flew with Singapore Airlines since long time. We had experienced a wonderful service, especially for kids. We were so disappointed when travelling again this time in July 2022 from Paris to Vietnam via Singapore. Fares were very high but foods were very poor, no more gift for kids, no menu for kids, no snack during long flight. We understand that pandemic may caused difficulty for all airlines, but Singapore Airlines should not cut expenses."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to Auckland via Singapore,April 2022,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,4.0,4,yes,8,"  Full flights, yet great service from a cheerful and engaged crew. The planes were spotless and comfortable, and the IFE selection was excellent - lots of new releases as well as plenty of art house movies. Sadly no pre-meal drinks run anymore though. And the food, whilst of good quality, seemed rather small and there wasn't that much on the tray; I also wished there were more Singaporean options available - because when there are, they are delicious. Toilets kept clean throughout the flight. Very good flights from a consistently good airline."

Having not travelled overseas for sometime due to the pandemic, I eventually got back to flying in April/May 2022 and it was so nice as I had normally taken a flight on average 20+ times a year prior to the pandemic. Check in was quick and polite checking my PCR result for entry to Bali security was quick and the Singapore Airlines lounge at Heathrow was okay. Boarding was more or less on time the seat as normal on SQ comfortable for the 12 hours flight. The crew where all pretty nice although I sensed perhaps not the normal expected on SQ, the food service was just okay good enough but again not really SQ standard that said the flight was fine. Arrival in Singapore on time I headed to the lounge to wait my connecting flight which was packed with little seating although I managed a shower. SIN-DPS was on the newer 787-10 which I really enjoyed nice crew food okay. I returned DPS-SIN in economy class again on the 787-10 and I was impressed great aircraft nice crew and the economy food box just fine for a 2 hour flight, I obviously like SQ and will continue to use hopefully service will improve as things return to normal"
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Singapore,July 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,1,no,1,"  Singapore Airlines no longer the same, my food tray was near empty. I had chicken noodles, that's about it with a bread. Food was no better from Melbourne to Singapore. The rice with chicken packed with rice and 4 pcs of chicken and a bread. Used to have fruits and cakes, what was called sandwich was a soggy curry puff serves right before landing. From Melbourne to Singapore many were not masked. The air stewardess talked to the unmasked passengers and throughout the flight the passenger was mask off. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Singapore,July 2022,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1,no,4,"  The boarding and take-off was delayed. The food on board was beef stew, a piece of cake and a cold, rigid bread. It was very difficult to see for the middle row. They were written at a place you cannot see from the aisle, you go to toilet when the light is off and then you cannot find your seat again. They served me drinks twice during an 8-hour flight, I know we can ask for it any time. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Phnom Penh via Singapore,July 2022,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,2.0,5,yes,6,"  This airline has good inflight service. However, when I went to check in the agent at San Francisco asked for my vaccine certificate. This is not required at my destination in Cambodia, nothing except rapid test on arrival. I explained this to check in agent. After a while the supervisor took over and checked the requirements on her personal computer. The problem was old requirement were never updated."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Business,Business Class,Singapore to Melbourne,July 2022,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4,yes,9,"  I was very surprised to read some of the comments in the review below. I travelled last week from Singapore to Melbourne on an A350-900 in business class, and it was one of my better flights this year. The seat product for a 7.5 hour flight was very comfortable with good privacy (6/1 tall), and the food and beverages that I was served were all to a good standard. Service was to the usual impeccable SIA standard, and the IFE choices were excellent. I accept that everyone's perceptions can be very different, but maybe sometimes there are some other issues at play when a review is written."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Business,Business Class,Singapore to Melbourne,July 2022,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1,no,1,"  Boarding was smooth. No welcome-drinks offered, after request I got one. A narrow business-class seat, where I felt squeezed in, a huge console on the left, which is too high to use as an arm-rest and a divider on the right with reading lights.  Sleeping for me was impossible, because the seat/bed is too narrow.  With the exception of slippers no amenities offered, I was re-assured that amenity-kits are available on request. Caesar’s Salad came without dressing and croutons were missing, too. The salad was a green salad-leaf, one in 2 parts cut cherry-tomato and two tiny bits of thinnest parmesan cheese. The 2 choices of white wine were disappointing: both Australian wines, 1 Chardonnay and 1 Riesling. My main course, pan seared salmon was dry and overcooked. The vanilla ice-cream was nice, though and the cheese platter was at least a choice of 3, but served with no grapes. No pralines offered. As for my second meal, Tom Yum Vermicelli with prawns. Again, the dish was small but I could get a vanilla-chocolate cake. The inflight program was functioning, but with little to no choices for me. Since no printed reading material was available I wanted to download some business magazines to my laptop, but was informed, that download is possible on smartphones and tablets only. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Business,Business Class,Munich to Singapore,July 2022,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,3.0,1,no,1,"  I was at the airport early and check-in was supposed to open 3 hours before departure but opened 15 minutes late with long queues for both, economy- and business-class already. No warm welcome back  by the leading stewardess. No welcome-drinks, no hot-towel and with the exception of slippers no amenities. For my after take-off drink I opted for a hot sake. Together with satays as canapés I got a tiny 4cl glass of sake and not the full 180ml bottle. One different guest, however enjoyed the whole bottle by his own – another example, that Solitaire-PPS-membership does not pay out anymore. I ordered a Gin&Tonic instead, delivered to me with my own lemons, which I brought from the Lufthansa-lounge. I also brought my own Lufthansa-refreshing-towels, which the crew chilled for me and brought to me after meals and sleeping. The starter (beef pastrami) was tiny but tasty. The chicken roulade with pretzel stuffing was a pretzel roulade with lots of pretzel outside and a tiny piece of chicken inside, dry and almost tasteless. My choice of wine (Australian Shiraz) was disappointing. Ironically, SIA re-introduced a printed menu, even featuring its ‘wine connoisseurs’ – but the actual wine-list was missing, so I could not verify the exact origin of my wine. The cheese-plate was disappointing consisting of 2 small tiny bits only (before it was at min. 3 choices, being freshly cut) with no grapes, as before. At least the Pumpkin Seed Parfait was nice and I was lucky to get the chocolate cake on request. No pralines. My choice of digestive, the Aberfeldy 16 years’ single malt was not catered for and a Japanese whiskey was offered instead. Why then having a single malt on the menu? As SIA doesn’t hand out any amenities to its business-class passengers,  I brought my own slippers and amenity-kit from a flight with Austrian earlier. The next disappointment was the economy-class-style breakfast with scrambled eggs or egg-noodles (2 different styles, though) and yoghurt or muesli. The only difference to an economy-class breakfast is, that the dishes are being served one after each other, but the sizes are tiny. I was lucky, there were still the seafood noodle soup from lunch left, so I decided for that. No freshly squeezed orange-juice. Thank you SIA for a good flight-experience before Covid. But now, with all the service and amenity-cuts it’s time to say goodbye."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,singapore to sydney,April 2022,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,1,no,2,  My initial flight was booked from Singapore to Darwin in April 2022. They cancelled my flight to Darwin for operational reasons and rebooked me after three days. I had to reach Australia earlier than rebooked date. I called the customer line and explained. They charged me to rebook me to a flight to Sydney as they had no other options available to fly me to Darwin. They did not give me a ticket from Sydney to Darwin and I lost a lot of money. Incompetent customer service staff and SQ's attitude to their own cancellation was pathetic. The flight comfort was okay but a big decline in their overall customer care. 
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Hong Kong to Singapore,June 2022,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4,yes,10,"  After 2 years of not being to fly with them, finally I made it! I was luckily to be chosen to upgrade from PE to J at a very attractive price last minute. It was money really well spent! It was wonderful to step into their premium cabin again, and experienced their excellent seat with many modern features. Their cabin crew are still amongst some of the best in the airline industry. I was greeted warmly and had excellent service from start to end. Having learnt that I was to go to Singapore to visit families and celebrate my birthday, they surprised me with a cake and some inflight goodies, that truly made my day! Personally, on this route, I did not see any decline in quality of meals and service. Except, maybe the lack of welcome drink, hot towels, which is excusable for covid reason. Meals are still served in separate courses, and with wine, which is constantly refilled. J class passengers, even upgraded ones like me, get 100 MB free WiFi, which was generous and very handy."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Siem Reap,June 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4,yes,9,"  From the moment we got to the check-in to the farewell wishes on disembarkation it felt like we had travelled back in time to the golden days of air travel – this is what it was all about. Truly friendly staff on the ground and in the air, a perfectly clean, spacious and tidy cabin all made for a flight that was most enjoyable from start to finish. I will definitely spend a few dollars more to fly Singapore Airlines in the future."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Phuket to San Francisco via Singapore,June 2022,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,3.0,3,no,6,"  I recently flew to/from SFO in Business Class and it was not worth it. On the surface, customer service seemed normal but it was a far cry from the past and not worth the extra money to upgrade from Economy Premium. If you are short like me, sleeping in the cubby hole, in a flat position is fine. Getting the seats up/down is a ridiculous exercise requiring assistance. Not the least bit convenient. It took 4+ hours for the flight staff to get my audio working. Food was some of the worst yet. Trying to get a glass of wine refilled was arduous. Because of all the stories of airline cancellations and delays, I did not risk flying from PDX to SFO with a short layover. Certainly 5 hours was sufficient. Because of the lame check-in policies and process for getting a boarding pass, I was forced to wait 3+ hours for the Singapore counter to open.  The United Lounge at SFO was great. On the flight, it was more of the same, as in the flight to SFO. In addition to the wait for a rest room, no amenities (like socks or travel kit) was offered to me. I will think long and hard before flying their Business Class again."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh to Denpasar ,June 2022,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1,no,2," Check-in was fast, because I could use the business-class check-in counters as a PPS-member. Otherwise endless queues. Boarding was slow because the flight was full and I boarded late with the crowds. No recognition as a Solitaire-PPS-member on board as before. Cabin crew busy with 'sorting' the passengers and their cabin-luggage to not miss our slot. Seat in a 3-3-3 configuration very narrow, seat-pitch ok (for me being 1.7m only) sufficient, however. Left channel of my speakers was not working, even after exchanging them. Internet not working on my phone, either. No help given to connect, as on earlier flights, instead 'proof' was given to me by a flight attendant that Internet was working on her iphone. Not really helpful. No reading materials. Very basic and little food-options offered in a tiny cardboard-box, 'designed for a reason' (whatever this reason may be). Very inattentive inflight-cabin-crew: As for the after dinner drink I was ignored by the them while my two seat-members got served their drinks of choice. Minimum seat-recline, similar to those in budget-airlines. No soap in washroom. No disinfectant-kits offered as advertised, I got one after request only. Wearing a mask, which is 'mandatory' was not re-enforced, a man in the middle seat was wearing his mask under his chin - no one of the crew cared. Overall the crew seemed to be overworked and de-motivated. The typical glass of champagne offered to me as a PPS-member when I raised my concerns did not really help, it just would have been good enough if the cabin-crew would have fulfilled their duties. Disembarking was fast and swift as well as delivery of my checked-in baggage."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Singapore,June 2022,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,"  The flight to London from Belfast was delayed, and I only managed to reach counter at 1100. I was told that I am not able to board SQ317, which depart at 1125. However, I was told by the ground staff not to stress and was assured that they will try to work things out. Throughout the process, they were very friendly, professional and prompt to get me a flight SQ305 back to Singapore on the same day, which departs at 1255. In fact, they get me a aisle seat with leg space. Having stressed out the whole morning with the delayed earlier flight, I breathed a sigh of relief. Thanks to ground staff Preeti and Kaye."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Amsterdam to Singapore,June 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Thank you to the cabin crew flying 20 June. After 2.5 years of COVID ravages, Singapore Airlines still maintains outstanding service and food. Complimentary WiFi worked very well too. It is sad that Book the Cook is now only available from flights out of Singapore, but it is minor. Singapore Airlines is still the best."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to San Francisco via Singapore,June 2022,2.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,,5.0,4,no,4,"  The second leg of my trip from Hanoi to San Francisco was on SQ032 on June 16th, and this is the flight I wish to review because my reserved seat was not honored. I was first given a seat which was totally unacceptable and I requested another aisle seat. The second seat was in the exit row directly next to the door (facing the crew jump seats). This new seat had no storage pockets since there was no seat in front, and had both monitor and tray table attached. The toilets were directly behind the crew seats giving me little if any privacy and almost no chance to sleep with the toilet traffic. It is true that this new seat had extra leg room. I was quite miserable in this seat due to the lack of privacy and I had to use the floor for my storage needs. Thank god for the snacks in the rear because the 2 meals served were pretty bad. The flight attendants were most helpful throughout the flight, but I will seriously consider my options when flying this route in the future."

Even with the changes due to COVID (no hot towel etc), the standard remains remarkable, especially the warmness of the cabin crews and extra care towards our 4 year old and 6 year old children. Drinks were replenished throughout the flight. Food and drinks were great with ""book the chef"" option. We had the signature Lobster dish and the meat was as tender as it can get, for an in flight meal. Departure and Arrival were on time as usual, and great effort by the cabin crew."
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Singapore,June 2022,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,,2.0,3,no,1,"  Prior to flying I had a nightmare trying to rearrange my flight when quarantine rules changed. Emails were not replied to and the UK telephone line required a pin to proceed.  The change I required was not possible online. I purchased an aisle seat but I was not allocated one when they changed my booking. The flight was very disappointing. We took off about 12.30pm. After 1 and a half hours were served a curry and rice, a roll and ice cream. There were only two drinks service during a flight of more than 12 and a half hours. Our second meal, breakfast was served 9.5 hours later. Unfortunately my seat was near the galley and the door to staff quarters and the crew slammed the door nearly every ten minutes and were really inconsiderate I thought. I was quite disgruntled so attempted to get a refund on the seats I had purchased and voice my complaints. Yet again I have found it impossible to contact them. "

The call centre is a disgrace and fails miserably in its job. Check-in was chaotic. Inflight service has dropped to dismal levels. There is no welcome drink, no hot towels, no menus given. The meals were one of the worst I have ever had. The eggs were dry and rubbery. I have had far better meals in the economy class on Flydubai which is a budget airline."

I was a little apprehensive flying on the 737 Max8 from Phuket but this turned out to be the jewel in the fleet. A beautiful spacious modern aircraft with unusually good legroom. No need to upgrade for this short flight. The catering let the side down. OK it was a short flight but serving wet noodles in a cardboard carton is not sensible. It’s too easy to spill or splash down your shirt, not a good look. There was some turbulence after about 30 minutes and the fasten seatbelt signs came on. Unfortunately, they stayed on for the remainder of the flight even though the turbulence ended after 4-5 minutes barring access to the lavatories. SIN-LHR on an A380. A complete nightmare.  I had an aisle seat with a very large male next to me spilling into my seat space for 13+ hours. This was forcing me into the aisle space where the crew repeatedly knocked into me either rushing down the plane or bashing me with the catering trollies resulting in no sleep. There was never an apology from any of the crew. The food was only just enough with many of the previously supplied items missing. I will never use them again."

The saving grace was no passenger in the middle seat.  The carpet in the aisle was threadbare. The seating upholstery was no better, very scruffy. No fruit, no salad, no cheese & crackers and only one choice for breakfast. A cold roll was served but only butter to put on it, no conserves. No pre meal drink service. One beer or 1 glass of wine served with the meal. No wifi all flight. The in flight entertainment had to be rebooted 5 times. The crew were very good on this leg regularly passing through the cabin with water. SIN - BKK a more modern A350. I was looking forward to my 1st flight on an A350. The seats were thin with little support. Again the only saving grace was no centre seat occupant. The crew seemed to be in training with young people following older crew members around. I purposely selected Singapore Airlines for my flight following their pre-covid reputation at extra expense."

Seat, and adjacent stowage bin were perfect. Bin could comfortably hold my Rimowa Attaché, but not Business Class. Took off on time, flew a different route than the incoming flight. Flew asleep, Cabin Crew gently tapped me on the shoulder, to eat. Have had ANA, and EVA let me sleep, and tag my seat returning later. Meal was good, Mushrooms had lots of flavor. Two-three rounds of drinks included. Recommenced sleep, and woke up. Cabin crew appeared taking drink orders, and brought back snacks. Crew continuously smiled, were warm, and professional, throughout the flight. They continued to check in, and ensure I didn’t go empty. Second meal served, again with endless drink rounds. IFE was not up to par, with what I’ve previously experienced on Singapore Airlines. Landed at EWR on time, with my bag quickly appearing. Would definitely fly Singapore Airlines again."

Singapore Airlines travel was Brisbane to Munich and Frankfurt to Brisbane, both of course, via Singapore. Both trips were 'busy' business trips where everything needed to be on time and hassle-free. Singapore Airlines exuded high quality personal service. Aircraft were spotless and cabins quiet, including on one sector (Singapore-Brisbane) when a number of babies turned up. Disappointing was the food and wine including the choices available. Emirates was far better in this category. Also, Singapore Airlines had no hot towels or printed menus. Maybe this was due to recent COVID issues but the comparison with Emirates was stark. Also Lounge access and quality was very poor. The Silver Kris Lounge in Singapore at midnight resembled a packed works canteen on a bad day. Boarding was quite chaotic at a number of places, especially at Frankfurt - which often seems to be the case for these Singapore Airlines A380 flights out of Frankfurt. Nevertheless, the quality of the cabin staff on all sectors was absolutely superb. Lets hope the quality of food and wine improves to how it once was."

The quality and quantity of food is lowered significantly, with cold food items covered by plastic. The cheese plate is pre-packed with 2 tiny choices. I was lucky to get as a Solitaire PPS member a second one. There was not even a slice of lemon for a good glass of tea or a simple Gin Tonic available. Wines are  offered based on red or white. Only after request, the bottles are shown. Yet, any description of the taste and the drinking experience is – thanks to the no menu. Same for food: no chance to enhancing your appetite by looking at the menu upfront, no chance to check quickly what kind of food you are enjoying right now because you need to open the digital menu – which means you have to pause the movie you are watching, search for the meal menu to finally get to the description of dishes - I did not manage to find it. No pralines are offered after the main meal anymore. No Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge available any more. No hot towels to refresh after boarding, after the meal or sleep. Chocolate (e.g. Ferrero Rocher before) on the snack-selection was replaced by cheap no-name cookies, which comes in a see-through plastic-container. The silver-kris-magazine available online only. The internet-connectivity was poor on this flight and did not work for more than 50% of the flight-time.  Significant lower services and amenities for a significantly higher price."

We have originally purchased our ticket to India from Auckland to Delhi and from Delhi to Auckland via Melbourne, leaving on the 9th of April and coming back on the 24th of April. We have received an email on 11th of February that our flight SQ4235 has been cancelled from Melbourne to Auckland. We have contacted the call centre and tried to rebook our flight. We choose the option of rebooking on 31st of May from Delhi to Auckland via Singapore so we have less transfers, flight number SQ403 and SQ4281 operated by Air New Zealand. The call centre operator informed us that all the economy tickets were sold on those flights, so we have an option to purchase Premium Economy tickets by paying an extra $937.60 NZD. We were charged this amount on 6th of March. We were excited to come back to Auckland and for first time in our life in Premium Economy. Unfortunately, our excitement was totally crushed when we realized we can only board the plane in economy class upon check in online. We have tried to contact the call centre again but were unable to get hold on an operator 3 times (we totally understand the current circumstances). The Delhi Airport staff were lovely but were unable to upgrade our tickets. We don't mind Economy tickets as we normally would not upgrade our flights but, in this case, we had no other choice and were charged an extra amount for nothing. "

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Auckland via Singapore,April 2022,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,2,"  My recent flights with Singapore airlines were some of the worst travel experiences I have had. We have been unable to travel to New Zealand for almost 3 years due to the pandemic. As borders were finally open we booked flights with Singapore Airlines, which were more expensive than any other airline, thinking spending more money would be worth it after such a long wait .. how wrong were we! Our outbound flight, SQ 305 on 17 March 2022 from London to Singapore was delayed by 1 hour and 53 minutes, which led to us being unable to make our connection flight to Auckland, SQ 281 on 18 March 2022. They then had a technical fault also and the flight was further delayed, causing our missed connection time to Auckland. The staff onboard the plane had no idea what was going to happen, and even though most of the aircraft had connections to make, they gave us no information and were incredibly unhelpful. Once we arrived in Singapore, it was an even worse state of affairs. We were greeted by a makeshift desk with everyone scrambling to give out new tickets (there were literally hundreds of people with missed connections). We were told we had missed our flight, and the next connection was 14 hours away. No food vouchers, no hotel rooms offered. We were told all the airport hotels were booked, however we walked to and managed to get a room, at our own cost. The next flight was also packed, and even though my partner and I had paid extra money for seats together, the new plane was unable to accommodate this and we had to sit separately. My partner has food intolerances, and none of his meals was catered for on the next 10-hour-long flight. He was offered some crisps and that was all for the entire flight. We honestly could not believe how bad the whole journey had been and arrived in Auckland completely and utterly exhausted. A really bad start to a trip we had been looking forward to for such a long time. On our return flight, we luckily made our connection. I would say the meals and customer service have gone downhill and it did not feel like we were traveling on a premium airline. Since being home, we have complained to Singapore Airlines and asked for a refund/compensation for our outward flight and the hotel we had to pay for. However, they claim it is not their fault and is refusing any refunds. "

They don't give any more amenity kits or we may have to ask? Also, they do not propose anymore any drinks like Champagne before taking off. The lounge quality is also not like before, I presume Covid is an excuse for everything but we are still paying the price so what? We should accept it I presume. The quality of the company service is clearly going down, I hope they will improve that for going back to their best but before reading that they are I will certainly try another company to see the difference."

The check in at LHR was seamless even with the necessary Covid checks in place and being done efficiently by the check in staff. Boarding the plane I immediately became aware of the ""Singapore girl"" exceptional customer service the airline is known for. The food service was efficient and rapid and there was a wide selection of other snacks available with a fruit bowl also with crisps etc for during the flight. The flight to Manila was smooth, service was also great even in the smaller less crowded flight. The staff continued to deliver amazing professionalism and attention to detail. The attention to detail became very noticeable on the return flight from Singapore to London. After another comfortable and pro professional flight from Manila I boarded the flight to London and for reasons unknown, my booked seat hadn't been reserved.  I was one of the first on, as I prefer to also sit at the back of the plane, and I mentioned it to the cabin crew who immediately took me off the plane, against the flow of oncoming passengers (I was that guy and felt very embarrassed) took me to the ground staff who radioed to the gate to change my boarding pass to an aisle seat which they did without any fuss or questions asked. As I had now moved seats and there are only so many meals in the trolley to cater for the expected number of passengers in each specific areas on the plane, my moving now had to be factored in and to my surprise I overheard once cabin crew day to the other ""Mr Taylor has moved from seat 67f to 46h"". When I left the plane the cabin crew by the door said ""Thank you for flying, See you again soon Mr Taylor"" Overall Singapore airlines for me is hands down the best and aside from the ground team at Singapore airport the experience was amazing and I will definitely be booking my flights with them again. Hopefully to try out their world class business class."

The person that picked up was not helpful at all, putting me on hold for at least another 20 minutes in total. In the end my request to refund the ticket into credits or money or at least rebook the ticket in the same class for another date was not fulfilled.

I was waiting for check-in for over 2 hours. The line just didn't move at all. The agent was extremely inefficient. I was one of the last customers to check in and it was about 30 minutes before the departure time. The counter agents was escorting a group of last-to-check-in customers to the security checkpoint so they could skip the line (we were late) and somehow I was the only one who left in the security line on my own. The service on board was terrible despite the high-regarded in-flight service that Singapore Airlines is usually known for. The service was so slow for a flight with only 160 customers.  I sat at one of the single seat toward the end of the aircraft and the steward kept bumping into me like I was sitting on the aisle. He didn't even apologize. My food was OK at best. The worst part was probably the lavatories. Truly disgusting, trash was everywhere on the floor. "

I told the CS rep that we did not need Business class for a 3 hour flight and requested a refund, the lady went to ask her supervisor who then told us company policy was no refunds. We went from being a happy customer to a very unhappy one. The food was the same as all other airlines, nothing memorable. The in flight staff were great. We are disabled. Very average service.

Sudden and unreasonable pricing policy changes? Totally annoying. During corona, SQ sold Economy (lite/value/standard) Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) tickets with certain terms and conditions for each class. Economy Lite offered what I needed: (1) lowest fare, (2) 25kg check in, (3) ability to change parts of the trip (before use) without additional fees, if whole return ticket price was similar/cheaper as original ticket. Changing ticket worked fine, and made me very happy with my purchase. However, since travel restrictions in Singapore have been relaxed, SQ has changed their pricing policies without notice (as in their small letters). Now they charge you unreasonable for a ticket price change: (1) Flight leg you want to change, (2) Look at one-way ticket prices for that leg of your trip (rather than whole ticket prices, as before), (3) your full trip fare that you paid, is then deducted from the one-way ticket price (which is often double that of a new return ticket on similar dates), (4) you're asked to pay the remaining difference in order to change your ticket.

We are happy with the check in and boarding. It was very smooth although there were COVID 19 documents to verify. Crew on board was cheerful and helpful. The soup does not taste peppery at all. This need to improve as Singaporeans will not like this. I had chicken rice and the rice was super nice with the chillie. The chicken could have been better with abit more flavour. The appetizers (salmons & prawns) were nice. Like the cheese and biscuits as well. When we were ask which red wine we would like to have, I’ve chosen the Barrosa red wine because I am familiar with it. At the initial stage suggest that the stewardess could have just recommend one of them since I was indecisive on which red wine to choose from. When I asked about any arrival and custom forms to fill in. A few of the steward and stewardess told us it is now done online but when we arrived the SFO ground staff told us there is no requirement for now to fill out any forms. SIA need to update their cabin crew about this as this was a bit of worry for me as I have not been to USA for 10 years.  Not the cabin crew’s fault for this. Overall the cabin crew team on board were cheerful and helpful. We totally enjoy the flight in business class especially my wife as this is her first time in business class and she enjoy the new business class seat a lot as she was I totally worried that she could not sleep but the food down seat converted to bed was comfortable for her to sleep in.

I’ve always loved Singapore Airlines, and I still do. Generally, a very friendly service, although I felt that the cabin crew on the MAN-SIN leg were a bit less so. I wondered if this might be due to travel fatigue after laying over from IAH on the fourth of four sectors. In-flight catering was my big issue with SQ on this trip. The flight time from MAN-SIN-MAN is longer due to the war in Ukraine and Russian airspace being closed - I reckon at least two hours more. I was a bit frustrated that the two meals were on opposite ends of that 14 hours. The lack of a printed menu (due to Covid - which I couldn’t understand as these have always been printed and distributed fresh anyway) meant that half way through the first 14 hours I actually paid for a bit of internet access, so I could see what refreshments were on offer (it was supposed to be free to do this, but I couldn’t work it out - although in hindsight, I should have just asked!). I was so hungry - the meals, refreshment and alcohol servings were just way too small. Entertainment is great, and the upgrade IFE since I last flew SQ a while back was nice. Seating in Economy is good (always nice to have three of four legs with a free seat next to me), although one the A380 the seat angle was very far back - some people like that, I didn’t. While not quite the uber luxurious SQ of days gone by, I still think they are a great airline. Just fix up the catering, especially."

A380 upper deck has many business class seats, some of the windows are obscured, my seat was rock hard though it was bigger and with more storage than previous flight. Long delay to my getting refreshments. Long delay to serving food. I got the impression that there are too many business class seats on the A380 for good service to be possible.

Meal was excellent by any standard as was the service. Where they went above and beyond was when my 2 year old son was feeling unwell, they assisted more than I would ever have hoped for. Flight was a bit more turbulent than normal due to the different route to avoid Russia and the Ukraine. The flight landed late due to a headwind. Luggage was out by the time we cleared immigration.

Users of Changi will know the security for flights at Changi is typically at the individual Departure Gate. Unlike at other airports where it tends to be before entering the Terminal. At Terminal 3 they've decided to do all the security for 4 gates, you are then in this little pig pen with 3 other flights, potentially 1500 people, it's not big enough. The lines for the different flights cross each other, and there is little by way of organisation. No one seemed to be in charge, when I politely mentioned it didn't seem very organised I was met with a blank stare. I didn't expect this at Changi Airport. A cheerful and informative crew, attentive to people's needs, even in Economy. The plane interior is pleasant, it was clean. The inflight entertainment was all right. OK, the food. Flight was at 00:30 hours, so there was no dinner, shortly after takeoff we went to lights out, with breakfast to be served 3 hours out of Melbourne. Meanwhile the hostesses came round on a regular basis with glasses of water. Breakfast arrived, lightly cooked sausages, scrambled egg, beans, and some nasty pasta tomato sauce, that smells of capsicum. The egg seemed to consist of only yoke, a small spoonful was enough to confirm it wasn't fit for consumption. I'm a keen airline food eater, I enjoy the tray format, and I'm not too fussy, but this was inedible. I complained and asked for the alternative, vermicelli noodles with some stir fried chicken. It wasn't great, too much vermicelli and not enough sauce, but it was adequate. An hour or so later, a senior hostess came and chatted with me, and asked me what was wrong, I described the egg, she said someone else had also complained, I thanked her for asking me. I had an extremely good Nasi Lemak going up to Bangkok from Singapore on January 8th with Scoot, so the Changi kitchens can produce good food, and needless to say Singapore is famous for its food. Please SQ, don't serve food which doesn't pass muster. At 5am Singapore Time most of us would be quite happy with a Continental breakfast. A roll, a croissant, jam and butter, a bit of pineapple, a yoghurt. Early days, we are all finding our feet. Like a lot of SQ travellers I am fond of the airline, and look forward to them hitting their stride soon.t"

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Bangkok via Singapore,November 2021,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1,no,3,"  We flew coach class from SFO to Bangkok in November 2021. We found that Singapore Airlines was not the airline of old. It used to be the best airline in Asia. No more. The seating was cramped, not on par with other competitor airlines such as ANA, and certainly no better than EVA or Cathay Pacific. They canceled our connecting flight on their subsidiary airline, Scoot, booked through Singapore Air, from Phuket to Singapore on the return leg. We were notified by email just 16 days before the scheduled flight. We were informed that we had to now fly out of Bangkok to Singapore, not Phuket, and we had to re-book through Singapore Air, not Scoot, and had to telephone a customer service agent to do so. This meant a total revision of our itinerary and losing the non-refundable tickets we had already purchased for flights in Thailand. We spent a total of 4 hours on hold attempting, without success, to reach an agent. We called both the Bangkok and Singapore offices to no avail. We even had a travel agent call for us on the agent's line. She gave up after 1/2 hour on hold. We tried email. They told us they would get back to us in 7-14 days. We had gone to both the Phuket and Bangkok airport Singapore Air offices but both were closed. We gave up and flew ANA home. They answer their phones. When we returned we found that all they would refund were the taxes. Sent a letter by post to the corporate headquarters. One month later no response, not even an acknowledgment of receipt."

Their new fit outs of their A350s have reduced the seat pitch and the seats are a step back in quality. The cushioning is very thin and hard which is uncomfortable and the seats themselves are poorly constructed. The seat in front of me would buckle and bend every time the average size person in it moved which meant my knees copped a pounding given they were crammed up against the seat because of the reduction in space.  These new seats negate SIA from being a feasible selection as an airline for me. Thankfully the plane from Singapore to Manchester had not suffered the same upgrade and was a reminder of how bad the Melbourne – Singapore update is.  The meals were also underwhelming compared to pre-pandemic with very basic options and accompaniments. It took them 3 hours after take off to provide food and remove the trays due to having only one trolley cart servicing each aisle in the economy cabin. The whole experience very much smacked of an airline that has been taken over by bean-counters and they are cutting costs at every turn possible with cramming more people on the plane and providing less food and staff, and ultimately an experience that is a shade of SIA's glory days pre-pandemic."

Only 1 meal was served on the flight and we were asked to choose whether to have it as dinner upon departure or breakfast prior to arrival. The meal was very average.

The seats on this aircraft were the new regional business class seats which are not bad. The IFE is also good and we had 100MB free wifi which was nice. The crew were good. However, the food was an utter disaster. For a 7 hour flight, we were given 1 miserable meal which was rubbery eggs and mashed-up vegetables. Book the cook was not functioning on this sector so we had no other choice. No welcome drink either. Standards have gone down drastically from many aspects."

The seat was very comfortable and had enough legroom. I was really disappointed with the meals. I chose the lemon chicken with fried rice. It was a very small portion. No salad was offered. The bread roll was in plastic packet cold and dry. The chocolate cake for dessert was okay. Usually flights between the east coast of Australia and Asia they offer a main meal and a pre arrival meal but on this trip no pre arrival meal was given. I feel like SQ is trying to save money by doing this. The IFE was good. Overall I won't be flying with them in the future. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Singapore,November 2021,,,,,,,1,no,2,"  We booked return flights from London to Singapore with a guarantee of unlimited complimentary changes. Due to COVID we could not travel in Nov 2021 and want to move the flight to Oct 2022. Online, it is impossible to move the flight to any date later than 12 months from the date that the booking was made. Calling Customer Service is tortuous! My partner has made three calls. Each time she has waited approximately two hours to speak to an agent. Each time she has been told that they have to make the change manually but then when the agent tries to action the change, they are unable to do so, refer to a manager and then promise to call back. They don't call back. This is totally unacceptable! On the latest call, my partner asked to speak to somebody more senior than the agent she had been speaking to. In the process of transferring the call, she was cut off. Nobody has called back.  My partner is not so stressed and upset about this matter that I have taken over dealing with the airline. We don't have time to waste on the phone trying to resolve this.  A five-star airline needs to treat it's customers with respect from the day of booking until the end of the flight. It's not all about the flight and service (or lack of it) prior to the day of travel needs to form part of an airline's overall score. Singapore Airlines are not worthy of your award at the moment."

Although the condition of my ticket was non refundable, they were so kind to refund me fully. It was processed immediately, with an email to confirm as well it. Such kindness and consideration during this difficult period for traveling is much appreciated. So glad to have been a loyal customer to this airline (I'm a Gold Kris flyer).

That face with Singapore Airlines flexibility claim of change of flights on their website, made me booking a flight with a 16h layover. Unfortunately, things were not looking good about a month ago, and I tried to change my flights to a short layover. I tried to contact SQ via its change of flight form for Covid related reasons through their website. 5 requests over the span of a month remain unanswered till today, complaint emails were also not replied to. I also tried to contact SQ through their callcenter, was placed in a loop for hours. After getting through after days of trying, I was told that there were seats available for the same booking class and I would be informed once the the ticket would be re-issued. So far so good. An hour later I was called, saying that this „special fare ticket“ can only be changed if if I pay this and that in addition, which ended up to a ridiculous amount, and I declined. So I was back to square and had to endure a 16h stay at Changi airport. SQ does not honor their claim of ticket flexibility. Other carrier I flew during the pandemic were willing honor their flexibility claims. The flights themselves were rather unremarkable, not as polished as Qatar, with no dining on demand offered. Food was average to say the least. No touchscreen TV and average seat on the really noisy 777ER on the long flight. Overall due to the non existing customer service on the ground, not recommended"

When the opportunity arose to travel to Germany under the vaccinated travel lane (VTL) scheme, I booked a round trip to Frankfurt. The business class product still retained its high quality in terms of attentive service from the cabin crew. I had ordered my meals from book the cook option and lunch was promptly served shortly after take off. Being a day flight, the cabin crew came around to convert the seats to bed mode. I managed to get some good sleep until dinner was served some 3 hours prior to landing. In terms of hardware, gone were the physical menus. Instead, an online menu was available. Pre-departure drinks were no longer being served to avoid unnecessary contact with passengers. However, meals were still served course by course like pre-pandemic times. Overall, SQ’s business class product has maintained its quality despite the pandemic. It is still a great way to fly."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,New York to Jakarta via Singapore,December 2021,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3,no,5,"  I was flying in the worst of times as Omircon had just been detected, yet despite all the restrictions and requirements to fly to Indonesia, Singapore Airlines on its own was not a good choice for a long flight. I had flown SA for many short hauls in Asia, but the discomfort on this trip was due to the routing, the business class set-up, the time in which this route took off, and the poor communication that is truly what SA seems to thrive on, the latter being years of frustration with flying with them; One can never get a person to speak with whether in Asia, NYC or LA. I had over 400K miles therefore I was getting award tickets, in business class, which I have flown for over 40 years consistently. The only ticket available for mileage went through Frankfurt, which meant I had to leave the plane (after 6 hours, middle of the night, but too early in Europe to have any of the lounges open), go through transit and feel like a zombie. (thank you Canada Air for being open and having showers!) But let's talk about the poor design of business class and lack of comfort. These were not staggered seating, so there was no privacy, the ""bed"" could not be done by mere mortals pushing buttons, its construction was convoluted and byzantine, such that an attendant had to physically configure the flat bed and mattress etc. So uncomfortable, as one had to contort oneself to actual fit the length. In the staggered layouts they are already at an angle. Any other flat bed can easily go from seat to bed with button pushing. I have flown to Asia and back from the USA no less than 50-60 times in the last decade and the choices of airlines with better routes and greater comfort, such as JAL, Qatar, Cathay and years ago even Malaysia Air. I don't understand why this airline gets such high marks? I know their agenda: to extend their reach and become a premier European carrier. I will continue to fly SA in Asia for very short hauls, but if I decide to go to Vietnam after many months in delightful Indonesia, it will not be on SA. I have other qualms, but let's face it, flying during this particular phase of the pandemic, with non-stop testing, non-stop mask wearing, abbreviated services, and less perks were not enough to make me stop traveling, but I thought, ""Well, I am in good hands"". The flying itself was lovely, (that was 21 hours, not counting stops in Frankfurt + Singapore). Good Grief! I have my return ticket on the same route in 5 months; I'll need my strength to just find out if there will be any other choice. (there wasn't in October)."

On the first leg one one hand a very nice and helpful crew which was on the other hand not very visible for customers in a very empty plane, only when you asked for something the helped you, then however very friendly. No welcome drink, No amenity kit provided, on both legs. No menus. The flight attendant explained they had only lamb stew or pork belly to offer for dinner. I can eat lamb and I did, but I know many people do not like lamb neither would eat pork; the meal was oK, but definitely not Business Class quality. No vegetarian option. Same thing on the flight back JFK to FRA, only 2 options. On the flight back the crew was more visible. The seats in Business Class are not so comfy as expected but still very good giving you a lot of privacy compared with Lufthansa Business Class. Good entertainment with good classical selection (I am a fan of classical music)"

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Jakarta to London via Singapore,October 2021,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I fear for the future of airline travel when airlines appear to use the excuse of covid19 to reduce both the level and quality of service, especially for an airline previously renowned for its 1st class operation like Singapore Airlines. I was bitterly disappointed in my recent flying experience with them; from poor quality food to reduced service levels. The crew was still wonderful, but that can't make up for the overall feeling I was left with. Forget your business class comfort pack (in my view, covid19 is not a reasonable excuse for why this has been dropped), you now need to take your own eye patches/earplugs to be able to sleep if you are prone to light/sound. Instead, you'll receive a covid19 kit so you can clean your own cabin area. Meals were of such poor quality that I wished I had brought my own sandwiches. No menus are available so you have to try and listen to rather badly-pronounced meal choices to make your selection. I chose chicken and rice which turned out to be bland and gristly, with practically uncooked chicken skin (see photos). Apparently, the different meal choice of the passenger to my left did not go down well as they also left theirs untouched. My breakfast choice; scrambled eggs and sausage were served practically cold. Excessive amounts of plastic being used in meal preparation is also very disappointing in a world trying on the whole to reduce plastic. This is hands-down the worst experience in business class that I have ever experienced and was compounded by the overly-officious ground staff yelling at us (in hazmat-like suits) to walk in single file as we were marched to a 'holding area' rather than a business class lounge. In this holding area, not even water was on offer. Other lines of passengers transiting on different flights were ordered to stand against the wall whilst our group passed by. My very strong advice, whilst covid19 continues to plague travel, is don't transit through Singapore or use Singapore Airlines. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Bangkok to Los Angeles via Singapore,September 2021,,,,,,,2,no,2,"  I booked a round-trip ticket on Singapore Airlines. The company touted customers' ability to change their flights for free, even being able to change a flight for free and having one free change after September 30, which would allow them to delay their flight well into 2022. I was able to easily change the flight until mid-September. After that point, I wasn't allowed to change it online and needed to call in which required over 1 hour of waiting. In September I could have changed my return flight to far into the future. In fact, the return leg of my flight was 2 months and 1 day after the initial flight. When I called in to push my flight date back, the customer service agent said I must upgrade my flight to rebook and that there was a minimum required stay of 2 months, meaning I couldn't have a the return leg of the flight more than two months after the initial one. First of all, my return flight was already more than 2 months later and before they restricted online flight changes, I could have changed my flight to much later dates.  The agent also told me the flight change would cost over 900 USD, more than the original round-trip ticket. I requested to speak to a manager. She denied my request and said she would talk to her team. After 30 minutes of being on hold, she said I could book my flight a maximum of one month past the current return date. This was not part of the agreement when I originally booked the flight. Now, however, I didn't need to upgrade the flight for some reason, but the change would cost 490 USD. Booking a one-way ticket at that time cost 497 USD. The agent explained that the difference was in the price of the flight. Nothing she said made sense.  I am about as likely to trust Singapore Airlines again as I am to fly with them."

The flight attendant was not able to tell me what types of wine were available. She even tried to convince me that a Chablis is a red wine. Everything was served on one tray. All those service shortcomings were explained as ""hygienic precautions"". The seat is very wide, but it’s hard to find a comfy seating position, and padding was insufficient. What really made me upset was the all nigh chit-chatting of the staff in the pantry. I know it was a long empty night flight, but please do not rob me of my sleep. This was not the first time I’ve experienced this on SQ. Transfer in Changi was chaotic, with passengers of each connecting flight being herded in long lines (nobody cared about social distancing here) before being escorted to their next flight. I’ve been on a long haul Qatar Airways flight a couple of weeks ago, and there was no compromise in services, and the staff was disciplined as always during the night flight. I was disappointed with my SQ flights after I have not been flying them for some time. I think some of their competitors are already ahead of them; so it’s high time for SQ to pull up their socks."

Both flights were very empty, which added to the comfort level - I had an entire row to myself, and most rows around me were empty too. Nonetheless, it would have still been comfortable even if full - seats were spacious, with excellent legroom, and plenty of storage space in the seatback. The IFE was good - a varied selection of movies and TV shows, and the screen was large and high quality. Meals were all good - in particular the fried carrot cake was one of the best economy class meals I've eaten! My only gripe would be that there was no alcohol service beyond what came with the meals: usually they would do a drinks run before meals, and then offer top-ups during the meal service. This time the only drinks were offered with the meal. I suspect this may be due to Covid-19, in order to minimise interaction: it wasn't a problem, as crew were always responsive to my requests. What really made the flight were the crew: they were so friendly, attentive, warm and welcoming. This must be a difficult time for them to work, yet they were all wonderful.

As a First-Class passenger and there are only 4 first class seats in the flight to LAX, SQ could, in the very least, confirm with me the refund amount and obtain my consent before refund. And after I disputed the refund amount as being unreasonably low (not enough for me to buy another one-way first-class ticket back), they should have the courtesy to handle the communication with the customer better and in a more timely manner.

I’m really surprised Singapore Airlines are profiteering from loyal passengers in this way. Surely as one of the leading airlines in the world they should be offering to reschedule flights when there is availability but at no additional fare difference cost. I enjoy the service they provide but I don’t like being taken advantage of / ripped off and I will remember this smoke & mirrors con trick the next time I book a flight."

Melbourne to Singapore flight was good. There were many passengers in the plane but at least we were one seat apart. Some even had the whole row just for themselves which gave them more space from others. But the transit flight, Singapore to Manila, was unacceptable, it was jam packed and most of us were given seats alongside others whom we did not know. In a 3-seat row, they made us occupy all 3 seats hence, social distancing protocol was not followed when they should have been more careful.

The service was pretty straightforward: efficient, smooth, procedural, orderly, helpful. I would say that they're more efficient than friendly, though. Singapore check-in and gate staff at Changi were quite pleasant and friendly, but on-flight staff were neither rude nor friendly. Hey, I'm fine with professionalism, as long as it's not done in a curt or rude way (I'm looking at you, most North American airlines!) Check-in at Changi, an automated breeze done in the new Jewel section. The plane and lavatories were clean.

And after I disputed the refund amount as being unreasonably low (not enough for me to buy another one-way first-class ticket back), they should have the courtesy to handle the communication with the customer better and in a more timely manner. So, I have requested for a reinstatement of my ticket instead of the refund on by emailing and calling customer service of SQ on June 5 and got a reply on June 30 that still under investigation. Current status as of Aug 20, it has been one and a half months and still no reply from SQ. "

For the initial weeks they were telling me that a cash refund could not be offered and I could only re-book or be offered credit towards booking another flight. After three weeks they then decided to officially cancel my flight (due to take off in early May) and agreed to process a refund. It has now been three months since I initially requested a cash refund via my travel agent and there appears to have been no movement from the airline.  I have received time dated copies from my travel agent getting in contact with Singapore Airlines in early April and they have received no communication from the airline has been received thus far despite me being told by an advisor at the airline confirming that they had been in touch with the travel agent to issue the refund, this was around a month ago.

Funny story the airline website indicate the plane were full where you can't select another economy seats, and pushes you choose at the end of the tail close to lavatory. Even when you're boarded the plane when clearly no people, they weren't let you sit on the same economy coach that were empty. I have to asked 3 times to asked them to move my seat (where less than 50 people on that flight) in such a big plane, which eventually they did it.

Since it wasn't a cancelled flight/ route, I decided to carry on. The flight for DPS-SIN were rather full and I enjoyed their Boeing 787. It was a short flight and dinner were served during the flight was delightful. We had a quick layover in Singapore for my connecting flight to Tokyo with A380. I sat on lower deck and the plane was merely full. They gave us light meal before turndown service, however a mistake was made by the cabin crew as they gave me a wrong food that am allergic too (I've never requested). I got sick during the flight. They kept apologise to me and one of the senior crew came to approach. They offered me a doctor service upon arrival in Narita which I refused. I got slightly better, but it shouldn't be happen. Despite of the allergic reaction due to their service, overall I was still able to enjoy the trip. It was just hindering me to give them a perfect score."

After booking the flight we received an email saying the flight was cancelled with no explanation other than to ring one of there offices in Penang or KL this was at 18.15 there offices close at 17.30. I feel that Singapore Airlines are taking advantage of passengers trying to return home how can they justify charging customers for wanting to return home early. My opinion is 2700RM was an exorbitant price to have pay for a change to flights tickets also the both flights had spare seats when we boarded the flights. We will be returning to Penang when this crises is over but as frequent flyers on Singapore Airlines we will be looking at other airlines."

No refund was granted, only to keep the ticket open for one year. They informed me that if I re-booked to a later flight, a fare difference might appear and I would have to pay on top. This is unbelievable. First they deny any refund, which all other airlines grant, now I also have to pay on top if I re-book to another date. As a frequent traveler and Gold Card Member of Star Alliance, I never expected such behavior from SQ. I strongly suggest not to tolerate such a customer unfriendly style. For me and my company, SQ is not anymore in the traveling list. We will prefer LH/TG going to Europe, and to the US. I am very sorry to write these lines, but other fellow travelers should be aware. By the way the way to get an answer from SQ might take 15-20 days."

Firstly the boarding in Melbourne was good, the ground and cabin crew were friendly and efficient. Plenty of legroom and nice comfortable seats. Noise-cancelling headphones were supplied although my wife had to ask for them as they weren't at her seat. The back of the seat in front was a bit grubby and I used an antiseptic wipe to clean it, there were some other grubby bits around the armrest and tray table. Champagne was offered and gratefully accepted. The meal service was prompt although it was just an economy meal. I was hoping for something a little better as I paid double the economy ticket price. Wine was offered however only one red and one white, I don't like Sauvignon Blanc and that was the only white. I did ask the flight attendant for a Chardonnay and she was very obliging and managed to find a glass for me. Big Plus! The flight was comfortable and the crew were outstanding. It makes a difference when the crew are customer-focused. Overall a good experience. Two things, ditch the Sauvignon Blanc and provide an upgraded Premium Economy meal."

The Singapore lounge was very spacious with a good variety of food and drink choices. Onboard both flights the seats were very comfortable and the service was impeccable. My Chinese-style vegetarian meal on the first leg was very tasty, but the Indian-style vegetarian meal on the second leg was not as impressive, with little curry and a lot of bread.

The overall in-cabin experience was fine, however, the check-in experience at the Ahmedabad airport was horrible. The staff gave me a hard time with baggage. It took 2 hours and standing in the check-in line three times to get my boarding passes. They weighed the personal bag and made fuss about the weight being 0.2 kgs over in one bag while it was 0.3 kgs under in another bag. I was told that the personal bag, which happened to be my laptop bag, cannot have anything else but the laptop and laptop accessories. I asked them if there was a scale I can use to distribute/adjust the weight across all my luggage pieces and they did not know or were not bothered to find out. Each time I had to go through bag screening and stand in long lines to find out that I still need to balance out 0.1 or 0.2 kgs of weight between my bags.  While I was going through this ordeal, the staff is trying to sell me upgrade to business class in spite of telling him no once. I do have to mention that I flew Singapore airlines from SFO to Ahmedabad on Jan 27th 2020 and did not have a similar experience with luggage at the San Francisco airport. Given the coronavirus outbreak, I wish the in-cabin staff had some masks on hand to distribute to passengers requesting it. All of them were wearing it and when I asked for one, they said they do not have any."

A few weeks in advance they changed several of my upcoming itineraries out of the blue with no offer of refund or compensation. One of the changed itineraries is a big change and really messed up my travel plans. First of all, I paid for a specific itinerary and they just decide to change it to an inferior itinerary. Secondly, I have a non-refundable domestic flight (not SIA) that I can no longer use with the new itinerary so I have to buy a new USD 100 ticket. So, I am USD 100 out of pocket. Customer service is non-existing with SIA. 3 weeks ago my domestic flight (not SIA) got re-scheduled and I arrived very early at MNL so I went to the SIA counter and asked if they could put me on the 2 hour earlier flight to Changi. My flight from Changi to Europe would be the same. So, I would have a 5 hour lay-over in Changi instead of 3 hours. SIA replied that they could do that but asked me to pay a change fee. I declined and took my original flight. I might think it is poor customer service but I acknowledge that they were in their full right to want to charge a change fee although it is in both our interest to increase my buffer time to reduce the risk of missing my connection. However, now that they changed my next itineraries I don't hear them talking about them paying a change fee to me. It is not OK to change and provide an inferior itinerary for the same price for any customer. "

Check in and boarding was, as is usual quick and efficient, with a friendly welcome from the crew. There are no pre-flight drinks offered in premium economy. Drinks are offered after take off, including French Champagne, but in tiny plastic tumblers. We had utilized “book the cook”, which had a large range of options, but these are served in an economy format, which nullifies any special qualities. There are no dedicated crew in premium economy, with the result that is approximately an hour before trays are removed and drink refills are available. The flight was good, the entertainment system excellent. The crew came round often with water and fruit juice, and a second meal was served before arrival. Overall this was a good flight with excellent hard product, excellent economy class service, but not up to the standard expected for premium economy. Why do Singapore Airlines not commit to a proper Premium Economy service?"

Left on Jan 27 2020 from LAX and returned Feb 21 2020. At their website we were told one can pre-book meals called 'book the cook' which was a joke, no none of the cabin crew knew anything about it. We were given a very generic meal which was nothing to rave about. I complained to the crew and they promised I would have my choice on the return flight - that did not happen either. Their website also bragged about free wifi at cruising altitude, I was able to connect for 10 mins ,after which there was no way to connect for free. Same thing happened when I logged -in under my wife's name - the cabin crew was helpless and could not help. I was told to pay to get wifi , which of-course I did not. The cabin crew were fantastic and did their best to make us feel happy but there was only so much they could do. I travelled frequently on Singapore airline about 10 yrs ago and then I switched to another airline through Hong Kong , regrettably I could not book with them due to the Corona scare in China. My seat on the A350 could not be reclined 180 degrees and my feet hit the front seat and I had to curve my body to fit the space. There was a bed of course -the flight attendant had to lower the vertical back section and fold it down to make a bed, but the hardness and the need to curve the spine made it hard to sleep on this 18 hrs from LAX and 15hrs to LAX. Sorry Singapore airlines you are no longer the top 'dog' in the business. I will think twice before going with you again."

We chose Singapore as we had heard lots of wonderful things about the airline. Our experience was worse than any bucket-shop airlines and we thought Singapore was a world standard airline. On the Siem Reap to Singapore Route my seat had a broken table which I was informed only on the way to the boarding the flight when I was suddenly being pressurised by their ground staff. Although I was waiting at the airport near the gate for over an hour none of your ground staff bothered to discuss this matter with me.  Furthermore the table was only secured with sticky tape which kept falling on my lap and on a couple of occasions fell on my watch! We then received further shoddy service from ground staff at Singapore on the Kolkata flight. Having paid USD 700+ for our one-way ticket from REP to CCU I was shocked to be downgraded to an airline with filthy seats, no TV, no leg space and in general badly in need of an uplift. To cap it all the cabin staff offered me gifts worth SGD 75 on the plane. This offer got progressively downgraded to a few miles on their airline. "

The usual Singapore airlines efficient boarding process using boarding groups on both flights. The seats on the 777 are more comfortable than those on the (refitted) A380. A pity because seat comfort is a priority on a thirteen and a half hour flight. To be honest, the old A380 seats were more comfortable than the new but the new look better. Wonderful attentive service from the FAs on both flights. The food served was good on both flights, in fact the ""supper"" (chicken thigh, mashed potato and steamed veg with gravy) on the A380 was exceptionally good for economy class. Sadly the breakfasts remain poor. They continue to serve these awful chicken sausages instead of a decent pork sausage (the ONLY thing BA does better than SQ) and the eggs are failures; either a rubbery omelette or scrambled egg that is sloppy and lacks flavour. I did notice some cost saving measures that I had not previously seen on SQ. No amenity kits, which I did not miss but no longer serving sachets of salt and pepper with the meals is a mistake. Airline meals generally lack flavour so I did miss the black pepper. There was also a smaller selection of snacks in the galley. In my view, they still beat the competition, mainly down to their superior customer service so I will continue to use them. The transit experience at Changi is also a big positive."

Very friendly and efficient ground service. Cabin crew is the among the nicest. Always up for your request. Food quality has gone down as compared to the past. However, drink game is up from offering cocktails and liquor for economy class. I thought I would enjoy the A350-900 more but turned out I like the Boeing 787-10 better. Too bad that the flight with 787-10 was too short. Overall, Singapore Airlines will still remain my top choice if I have to book a flight."

I had looked forward to where I could go with the new Airbus 350 and Singapore Airlines with their excellent quality reputation. However, the entertainment consisted of very few new movies. A menu card was handed out, I ordered chicken with Thai curry. The meat was full of cartilage and the rice was dried up. This was accompanied by a cold soft sugar tasting roll.  Singapore Airline offer maybe the cheapest red wine I have tasted. Fortunately they offered Tiger beer. Although the crew carried sparkling wine on the wagon, you had not right to this since ""it was not in the menu card"" I was told. Very strange.  On the return flight to Copenhagen the entertainment was slightly better but the food and beverage was far below the standard you get elsewhere like Qatar Airlines. The experience with Singapore Airlines was the biggest disappointment I have had since very long. "

The inflight entertainment system was old school, but the channel and contents were up to date. The crew were very nice. The meal was okay, i had this fried noodle with beef served with bun and some fruits. There were always lot of different beverage options on Singapore Airlines which is actually great. It was a short route to Singapore and i did really enjoy the flight. Singapore to Seoul Boeing 787-10. B787-10 legroom was a bit shorter but still enough for 180 cm man like me. But the arm rest gap was a bit narrow. The configuration was 3x3x3 and i sat on the middle and two other passengers sat on my right and left side. It was quite okay at the first place, then the meal time came up. I struggled not to spill other's passengers meal with my elbow because it was narrow. The entertainment system was really new. It had a lot of different options there and it was up to date. It was 5 hours 25 minutes flight. We just had one time meal and one snack time. It was okay tho. There were 2 options such as Korean or Western menus. I opted Korean one with the menu of Bibimbap. It was just okay since bibimbap was only vegetable and beef mixed with Korean condiments and. The cabin was clean and the most interesting of this aircraft that the window shades was electric by dimming the windows colour. It was nice! This was my first time flying with Boeing 787-10 and i still like A380 or A330 better compared to this aircraft."

We departed our flight from Ho Chi Minh City and were on our way to catch our next flight to Los Angeles, when we realized that we had left our Iphone 11 on the plane. The phone was left in the compartment facing the seat. We immediately went to Lost and Found and explained that situation and also informed our agent at the the gate. There was more than enough time for them to have searched the plane before our departure. Unfortunately, we never received any word from the airline. We also filled out paperwork in Los Angeles and we tried contacting Singapore Airlines on many occasions and did not receive one reply. Such a disappointment, the airlines doesn't have the decency to correspond. For an airlines that has such great reviews they definitely lack in common courtesy."

First of all, the service has dramatically improved since my last trip with SIA. Cabin crews are super friendly, cheerful and serves customer with a big smile. However, the most disappointing part is the attitude of the ground staff in Busan. One of the ground staff was very impatient and does things insincerely. She delays the precious time of my travelmate by asking unnecessary documents as other ground staff does not require it. Another shocking part is the cleanliness situation of the cabin which was quite dirty and not up to SIA's standard. There were coffee stains on the tray table and the cupholder of the seat. However, the cabin crew was responsive and quickly cleaned the stain for lunch. Food was OK and when I did not finish my food, the cabin crew did asked for feedback and offered me other options which is something I appreciate. Despite the disappointment of the cleanliness and attitude of the ground staff, the cabin crew's attitude actually made my day."

Okay food but they ran out of certain dishes during the first service run. Service on this flight was understandably rushed due to its 2-hours duration. But it was also terrible. I ordered post-meal drink and notes were taken but they forgot about me. I requested the drink again, but was told too late the bar is closed. We pay premium for business class partly to enjoy the amenities including F&B. Running out of certain dishes and forgetting to serve a drink renders this as a wasted expense and for that we currently do not recommend this airline. "

Singapore Airlines staff are  warm, helpful and very hospitable.

Check in at Denpasar was very friendly, the staff happily gave me a window seat and once on board, I was amazed, the plane was new and was extremely comfortable. I can't wait to fly with them again in future."

Cannot say that I was looking forward to spending 17-19 hours on an aircraft, however the time passed very quickly indeed and would recommend Singapore Airlines and this route if wanting to access the US east coast. Service was good, and premium economy seats were comfortable. Used the book the cook option and the food was okay - there is also lots of snack available in the galley when you want. The IFE is one of the better ones on the market, with a decent touchscreen and good selection of movies and TV shows. I booked one of the seats at the rear of the cabin which is by itself and this is certainly worth while doing. Overall, it was recommended and would take this option again to NYC from Singapore.

We were checked in 2 hours prior to the flight time but were never paged us or looked for us. Just took the luggage out of the flight. They advised us that the next flight is full also and we will need to wait till the next day for another flight as well as having to pay penalty.

I recently received a status match I am QF platinum and received kris gold. At the airport I proceeded to first class check in (allowed with qf platinum) but did not realise that Kris gold doesn’t provide the same benefit. I was told by the check on supervisor that I was being unfair to other passengers as if I had come to the wrong desk on purpose.

There were no more menu cards in Premium Economy, something I’ve got even in Y class on the same flight a year ago. Food was ok .. but nothing to shout about. The most disappointing part was the robotic, not overly friendly service. I think the days of the famous “Singapore Girl” are gone. Carrier like Qatar Airways are miles ahead here."

Then I asked for Chinese tea (instead of what they were taking around) - and was told ‘we don’t have any’. At SFO check-in counter, I stood at the head of the Premium Economy line for 15min as passengers who had come after me were attended to before me. After 3 such times, when I expressed surprise, a lady said I was in the wrong queue for bag drop. I pointed out to her I was not standing for bag drop but check in, after which I was attended to. This was the first time ever that my SQ experience left a bad taste in my mouth, especially given how wonderful it always is, and how warmly I recommend it to everyone specifically for its customer service.

Yet another excellent flight on Singapore Airlines despite flying on the older product. The older A380 was operating this 14-hour flight from Singapore to London but I still enjoyed the seat. My cabin was nearly empty and we could choose whatever seat we wanted. The seat was huge - it had a lot of legroom, width and was very comfortable. Unfortunately, the IFE was not touchscreen and it was not very responsive, which would be expected for a 13-year-old system. There were still a large variety of movies and TV shows in the entertainment system. The crew were friendly, helpful and provided excellent service, they really made the flight enjoyable. The food was absolutely delicious. I could hardly tell the difference between this airline food and food on the ground. We arrived in London on time."

When your paying this much money it’s not acceptable. Amazing staff and food, especially book the cook. We had very turbulent flights and as a nervous flyer they couldn’t have been more caring. Absolutely not a bad thing to say about them apart from the fact that we weren’t on a A380 but 777 which is a horrible plane to fly. "

We loved the lie flat beds, although a very warm cabin prevented getting a lot of sleep. F&B service excellent and professionally served by the SQ crew. Love the ""Book the Cook"" service where you can order fine dining meals in advance. Great choice of wines and plenty of champagne refills! My wife can only eat gluten free meals and a small criticism is the lack of gluten free options, WiFi allowance of only 100 Mb in Business Class is rather limited as well. Very smooth transfer in Singapore and Kris Lounge not too crowded. The Turkish Airlines lounge used by SQ at Istanbul Airport is massive and offers an excellent choice of hot Turkish food. All in all, a great flight with SQ and look forward to flying Business Class again with them soon."

When we are about to land, a passenger went into toilet, the Male Flight attendant asked him before he went in “can you hold ?” The passenger shook his head &’went in, subsequently the flight attendant talk to us (all the passengers), this kind of people caused landing to delay. After a while the flight attendant went on to knock on the toilet door & shouted to ask the passenger to come out quickly. Moscow - Singapore 2 Jan 2020. The  question is that does SIA inform their passengers how much alcohol they can consume ? I heard a female flight attendant said “he has drank a lot” in Mandarin to another flight attendant. Later the customers in front of me request for drinks & I heard the flight attendant said “this is a plane not a bar”, this is very rude to a customer even you mean well to control consumption of alcohol. SIA has to make a decision, either no alcohol, limited alcohol (informed passengers before booking of tickets) or free flow, find a way to handle it instead of being rude to  passengers. "

There was a family of five that was too overbearing and inconsiderate (non stop talking from SIN to EWR) during the entire flight. This made it very difficult to sleep even on premium economy. Paying extra $120 each for these seats was a waste of money. The food (including ""Book the Cook"") was not extraordinary. The entertainment selection (movies, music, TV series) was inadequate. I understand that the flight crew needed rest during this long journey. However, not cleaning the toilet bin was unacceptable. I've flown other competitors on Premium Economy (ANA, EVA) and I can attest that the toilets for Premium Economy were kept immaculate during the long legs to either Japan or Taipei. There is something to be said about the passenger treatment when they are not flying Business Class. On a separate flight from MNL to SIN, my wife and I flew SQ on business. The customer service was met. Unfortunately, Premium Economy customers are not treated the same way."

Decided to try premium economy due to extra legroom and slightly wider seats although the additional recline is negligible. These two options were provided but the seat itself was uncomfortable and the much vaunted leg and foot rests are not fit for purpose if you are of average or above average height. I used the facility of “Book the Cook” for two of the four meals provided (return flight) but sadly the meals were unappetising, bland and why is the airline no longer providing salt and pepper? There was only one round of drinks offered so although premium economy is quite a bit more expensive than economy the benefits are small except for the leg space. Also had to use economy toilets which would have been fine except that they were not particularly well maintained but I do admit that both flights were full up so staff would have been kept busy. As usual the flight attendants were beautifully groomed and always polite Very surprised at the lack of variety on the entertainment system"

Boarding was slightly delayed but well managed with priority given to those traveling with children. New A350 which on the regional is still 3x3x3 but a little less space between the seats and no premium economy, actually prefer the cabin colours to the long haul version. Staff were very friendly with the service being first rate and a good selection of meals options. Very pleasant 4.5 hour flight. Flight arrived on-time but due to a medical emergency everyone had to remain seated until the person could be deplaned. This took about 30 min which then meant that due to 2 other flights having landed immigration was chaos,(not SQ fault). Having flown A350 and 787 I can now say that the Airbus is the better plane."

Drinks were brought out every hour to ensure that people stayed hydrated. Plane was clean and so were the bathrooms at least when I used them. As usual a wide selection of entertainment was available. The A350 is a great plane to travel on and SQ has made sure there is plenty of legroom, the storage pockets are great for holding phones instead of having just one big pocket. Once again a really good flight."

The seats were comfortable in business, although they could be less comfortable for a tall person. With the 787s, the space between the seat and the TV monitor is quite narrow and when the table is out, one must sit quite upright. It is not as comfortable as the Airbus or Qatar’s q-suites but definitely way better than 99% of other airlines. I had the lobster thermidor and was happy that this is much better now - tender yet creamy sauce. There are Asian drinks on board, such as umeshu, which is brilliant. Free WiFi was available on board and lasted through my 5 hour flight even with Facebook surfing."

Mid-night flight fmainly to see how the 787 compares with the A350. Check-in was smooth save for the issue with them not allowing us to take the travel stroller, which folds into something the size of a briefcase on board as it wasn't in a carry bag? Random thing is 2 previous legs and several other flights with SQ this wasn't an issue but we were told it was a new rule. Odd thing cabin crew never heard of it and 3 days later from SIN-MUC there were no issues with it being taken as hand luggage. Flight boarded late due to a late arrival but some of the time was made up with a near on time arrival. The 787 has a tighter configuration than the A350 regional configuration. This means less seat width and what I perceived as a little less leg room. Plane was spotless. Given the choice I would take the A350 over the 787 as it has it beat in all areas. Crew were more or less going through the motions and a bit robotic. Entertainment options still top, not even with 4 legs flow in the same month did you run out of things to watch. Breakfast served was good with all options available. Of the 4 legs this was probably the most disappointing from SQ, but still an enjoyable flight."

Until now I have been very happy with SQ and have always preferred it above Cathay Pacific (hence the extra 4 hours in taking these flights instead of the direct flights) The flight was great and nothing to complain .. as a cardholder I had access to the lounge and SQ has been always great in accepting my kids (younger then 12yrs) with me in their lounges. Upon arrival in Hong Kong I discovered that one of my suitcases was damaged (zipper was damaged and could not be used anymore)/I went straight to their handling agent and was offered 3 options: 1) they could provide me with a report for my travel insurance, 2) They could try to fix it or 3) I was offered 500 HKD (50 Euro) as compensation. I argued with them that they destroyed the luggage so why should my insurance pay for their damaged caused, also the 500HKD would never cover a new suitcase (bought a year ago) so I asked to see somebody from Singapore airlines .. a girl appeared and immediately the same offer was made but the amount got up to 800HKD .. I argued that the money wouldn't even cover a new one. So she agreed to have my luggage picked up from my place in Hkg and tried to have it repaired. Nothing happened for 3 days and I was forced to contact the airline direct. Anyway suitcase was picked up on Thursday and was told on Saturday afternoon that they couldn't fix it and would offer me 1080HKD (no idea how they came to that amount) and it was a take it or leave it deal. What actually made it worse that up till today I have not received any apologies or even an acknowledgement of damage caused by them."

Secondly, they don't give you a choice of meal. Not to mention the food was barely edible. And they only give a bottle of water. I had to pay for beer or soft drink etc. Given I paid SIA prices which is for full service, you'd think I'd get more service than that."

I have no complaints about the great cabin crew on the flights. They were hard working and very polite. Our main issues with the delays with boarding, departure and arrivals. We have almost missed connecting flights on 2 occasions. The second one was the trip from Sydney to Singapore. We had a very stressful time changing terminals and walking several hundred metres to the gate when the boarding of the second flight was scheduled to start while we were still on board the 1st flight. I had had recent surgery and literally ran to the gate with my hand luggage. Ground staff are less than helpful as well - boarding using boarding groups is ridiculous- so much confusion and people trying to pass people putting luggage away. Why not call boarding by last few rows at a time rather than a huge boarding group. Staff on the ground disorganised - twice Singapore airlines has lost our luggage and we were left on holidays for a couple of days with no clothes, till we have managed to get our luggage - food was tasteless, surely no one likes the cheese and mushroom mini pies on the Colombo-Singapore leg."

Singapore Airlines has disappointed us in the last three trips. The price they charge is so expensive but from Singapore to our destination we get to travel in budget airlines which is Scoot or silk air. It doesn’t make sense at all. When we ask for help they say it’s a different management so we can’t help you further. Moreover there is no special assistance in those low cost airlines. Also the Singapore airport was so warm and the air conditioner was not controlled well across.
Not Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Johannesburg to Singapore,December 2019,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,5.0,4,yes,8,"  Johannesburg to Singapore in premium economy on the late flight. The incoming flight was delayed as the preceding flight was late departing the gate, and only arrived at the time boarding was supposed to start. However following a very quick turnaround and very efficiently organised boarding, the flight departed on time. There was the usual warm welcome from the crew, who were very active helping passengers stow belongings and settle in. Singapore Airlines do not offer pre-departure drinks, unlike most airlines in premium economy. The seat is comfortable, with good legroom and recline. The calf rest serves little purpose, and is difficult to retract when deployed, which is usually by accident. It was noted that very few passengers used the calf rest. The cabin overall is very pleasant. Service commenced promptly after take off. There was no separate drinks run, which is understandable with a late departure. The meal can best be described as typical airline food, the best part being the ice cream. Service and food is strictly economy class, no crockery nor tablecloth, and from Johannesburg no opportunity to book the cook. Drinks are served in plastic tumblers, with a somewhat meagre offering. A good champagne is offered in premium economy, but in a plastic faux stemmed glass that is even smaller than the standard tumbler. No refills are offered until the trays are cleared somewhat later. Both my wife and I were able to sleep for several hours, and it seemed quite strange to be woken up from a deep sleep to be offered lunch. This was about two hours before landing, which was ahead of schedule. De-planing was quick, and immigration and luggage collection super efficient, as is the norm at Changi. Overall this was a good flight, with excellent service measured against the standard of economy. Unfortunately it is economy class service, and through no fault of the crew lacks the extras expected in premium economy. The lack of crew dedicated to premium economy is an issue."

I am not saying my previous SQ flight was bad or awful, it was great but I did feel like they could have improved more. But, my recent flight with SQ was near flawless! It seemed like they had listened to customer’s feedback and made the overall experience better. The most obvious improvement was the IFE system. They employed the newest technology regarding the IFE system, the screen was wide and really responsive to touch. The colors were bright, there were some of the newest released movies available and the available media content (music, video, movies) were more than enough to accompany your whole journey. I didn’t even open my ipad throughout my trip. The seats were redesigned, I felt more comfortable and the leg space was spacious. The food and beverage was even more tastier and ever. At the moment, for me, it is the best airline! It’s not perfect though, I want SQ to outdo themselves and become better overtime. If I could give one suggestion, I would like them to provide wireless connection for the headphones because their in house earphones don’t cut it and most of todays head/earphones are wireless."

Leg from Sydney to Singapore the plane left on time, but what a disappointment the boarding process is, compared to Changi. The Boarding by Group No is a neat idea and works well at Changi, but Sydney is just the usual fare of Economy passengers standing in a massive queue trying to get on as quickly as possible and staff announcing the boarding by group, but not enforcing it. And the overhead screens showed Group 4 non-stop whilst they boarded other groups, whatever. Service on board was warm and welcoming, food was good but, surprisingly, even though it was announced, no immigration cards were handed out. When I asked, I was told they didn’t have any. I think they just ran out of time. Love flying on the A380, spacious, calm and quiet, it’s a great experience. Got into Changi a few minutes early. Next day afternoon take off for FRA on 777. Food was sparse and mediocre but not bad. Just not quite the same standard and amounts as last year. The entertainment system has a big screen but the amount on offer is nowhere near Emirates standard and it is harder to find things/operate and the touchscreen is sometimes not as responsive as one would have liked. Crew again, very good and friendly. Lots of snacks available incl very fresh apples during meal times, the wines from Chile were excellent and the crew was always walking around with drink trays. A disappointing cost cutting measure on both flights was that they don’t hand out amenity kits anymore, unless you ask cabin crew for them. But otherwise ok."

The business class seats lie flat but is rather cramped once the table is out. In terms of comfort, it is ok - not as good as the Airbus used for long haul flights. The compartment for legs is rather narrow, so could be uncomfortable for someone taller who needs to bend his/her knees. The food is good, which maintains the Singapore Airlines standard of food. Service is good. The number of drink services is not as frequent as other flights. Overall, I am still happy with SQ and will fly again."
Not Verified ,A380-800,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,New York JFK to Singapore via Frankfurt,November 2019,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,8,"  Flew JFK-FRA-SIN vv on SQ25/26 on Premium Economy. Great value overall with airfare at $1000 RT. JFK facilities are subpar in T4 for premium airline - boarding was chaotic with roughly six separate lines outside main gate to handle the double decker flight. Prem Economy cabin was nice and clean, nice orange/grey color scheme. Blanket and pillow on seat, along with with noise cancelling headphones. Amenity kit upon request containing socks, dental kit. Eyemask upon request. Nice pitch, calf support and generous recline for Economy. Meals were on the smaller side, only difference with the back I believe is an extra choice and champagne on plastic cups. Was able to prebook meal using Book the Cook which is a nice feature for Premium Economy. JFK-FRA cabin crew much friendlier than FRA-SIN, but still the trademark SQ service throughout. Krisworld has a great selection of movies and TV- the add playlist is pretty nifty and easy to use. Transfer at FRA was 90min, no fuss, no security. Arrival in SQ was easy and quick. Check in on return flight was great, T3 of Changi is very nice. Return flight was non-eventful. Excellent service particularly on FRA-JFK sector (less full) whereas out of SIN was packed. Great experience overall. Would definitely recommend the PremEcon if you keep the fare to less than $1200. Not sure if the value is there if you pay for much more."

Shanghai is currently among a few airports that receive SQ updated A380 service. The new suites, only 6 in total that occupy the whole forward section of the upper deck, are spectacular. For comparison, in the same area, Etihad fits 9 spacious Apartments, while Emirates manages to squeeze in 14 First Class Suites. The armchair was very comfortable with thick padding, and the bed was easily the most comfortable I have experienced on a plane. The suite itself was so spacious that I thought I was sleeping in a small hotel room. Meal service was great with a lot of attention to details, though I did not find the food as tasty as on other top first class services, including SQ own old Suites. I probably chose the wrong menu item then (book-the-cook was not available for Shanghai). On the ground, I got access to Air China First Class Lounge, which offered both buffet and a-la-carte dinning, though I did not try those as I was full from a big lunch in Shanghai."

Furthermore, the IFE was responsive and there was a very large variety of movies available. A lunch menu was given to all passengers, which is a great touch to an already good service. Lunch was served on my flight and it was a delicious pork and chicken combination. The crew provided excellent service and promptly provided me with drinks whenever I requested for them."

A mechanical problem with the plane after shifting our gate to a half hour walk away from the original. They go into total chaos, total ineptness. No other plane available. They do not shift passengers onto their other flight, another plane, or other airlines. Four hours later, they send a new plane from Singapore. So six hours delay. The hand writing up of food vouchers for the layover was also quite humorous for 200 passengers. Very poor communication at all times, not even answering direct simple questions.  With the checkin process, more than 12 hours living in the airport. "

BLR-SIN was a short haul flight which was even more tightly packed, SIN-MEL was marginally better. MEL-SIN was an older B777, which was far better than the new gen 350s in terms of economy class seats. I had booked SFML, but in every flight ended up getting a piece of tasteless, overcooked fish just dabbed with some tomato sauce - a big difference from my previous experience with seafood meal a few years ago. I do not think I will go for this option any more on Singapore Airlines. The flights were on time, the crew helpful, but overall my experience was far from being positive."

Service is quick, friendly and precise and they may be the only airline I’ve flown with that offers hot towels to economy passengers (though it’s pretty standard for premium economy). The premium economy seats are well equipped with large seatback displays, large windows, and comfy leather seats, and the food is decent. Nice of them to have a legrest and footrest on the seats and I’m pleased to say most flights were quite punctual. Check in was quick and easy, and planing/deplaning was efficient. Cabin crew exercised caution when assisting guests with stowing luggage in the overhead bins, and they periodically passed by with refreshments"

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bengaluru to Brisbane via Singapore,October 2019,4.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3,yes,6," Bengaluru to Brisbane via Singapore. I have been travelling with Singapore Airlines for several years now. I have never had a bad experience ever. The last time we flew, however, was quite disappointing. I observed 2 things - 1) we always order Indian meals and have been satisfied always, but and the quality of the meals this time was quite bad. The first meal was a tasteless serve and the second one was of 3 Quiches (since when are quiches Indian meals?). And they were bad anyway. Furthermore, on the return trip, my wife received 3 oily and smelly Samosas. Who serves 3 samosas in one sitting? What is the chef thinking? 2) the staff while polite was not involved as they usually are. In my experience, Singapore Airlines makes a very conscious attempt to connect with travellers. They aim to make you as comfortable as possible, however, this time there was a non-commital attitude which was very unlike them. I had to ask for water more times then I can remember. Earlier it was always served in intervals because they were prompt. No feedback form was shared too. My child always receives some small talk with the staff and a little gift. This time there was no attention and no gift either."
Not Verified ,A380 out and 777 return,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Singapore,November 2019,2.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,,5.0,4,no,6,"  I have to admit to a huge disappointment on flying economy class with this airline. The outward trip on the A380 was extremely comfortable, flight attendants good but food was awful, something I wasn’t expecting having read about the excellent quality of their meals. My main grumble was the return flight on a 777, I have to say that the seat pitches couldn’t possibly have been the 32” advertised on Skytrax. I am 6ft tall and my knees were touching the seat in front and reclining made little difference as the person in front was fully reclined. I can fully understand how a sardine must feel! The food on this flight was awful, totally lacking in taste. Now I know that some people reading this review will say that if I want more room then fly premium economy or business class, something I would love to do if it was affordable! All in all, flight attendants were wonderful, food was awful and the 777 was diabolical. Sorry Singapore Airlines I won’t be flying with you again other than on a A380."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Dubai,November 2019,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,4.0,3,no,1,  Singapore to Dubai. I was disappointed with the option of foods during flights. We were asked by the FA to choose between chicken sandwich and Hamus with flat bread so I chose the chicken sandwich since I am not a fan of Hamus but it wasn’t available anymore so the FA insisted if I could have the Hamus instead. I just had a cup of coffee. And also I have also asked for water twice during that flight but nothing was given to me. It made me think that they gave only minimal attention to economy passengers.

A pillow and blanket were available on the seat when we boarded. The cabin was clean and despite the flight being nearly full, it was still a very good experience. Furthermore, the legroom of the seat was excellent and the seat was very comfortable. The tray table was wide and sturdy, and there was sufficient storage with a nice pocket for my phone and nice pouches for me to put things in. There was a wide selection of movies available as well. The cabin crew were as usual, excellent and provided great service. A meal service was provided for this red-eye flight, and my Chicken meal was good. Despite being delayed on departure, we arrived in Shanghai on time. SIA’s newest product on the 787 is indeed very well designed and the flight was very good overall."

I booked this flight under SIA and was not expecting they would code share a full service fare ticket with low cost carrier Scoot on SIN -TRV sector. SIA is charging the same amount in fare as compared to previous years while they code shared with Silk Air which is a full service airline. There was no option for basic seat selection and was served instant fried rice topped with meat and peas. They served a bottle of water and no option for tea/coffee or soft drinks. Silk Air served beer and spirits . I understand why SIA is resorting to this sort of behaviour at the expense of passenger comfort, profits and making use of the monopoly they enjoy on this route. Shameful for an airline which advertises itself as ""Great Way to Fly"". SIA should make amends to passengers who were made to fly on Scoot SIA - TRV route."

I've been intending to try Singapore Airlines for some time and was keen to know if the reality matched the star rating. The quality of the product, seat and service onboard and on the ground met my expectations fully. The only slight quibble, and it is very slight, is that no amenity kit or pyjamas are offered in business class. The usual amenity kit contents are available as individual items, however in the bathrooms. The seat was excellent, food met expectations and was better than many others. The IFE offering was a little disappointing however and they ought to make a bigger effort here."

I thought I loved Singapore airlines and it seemed okay (not great) when I flew from Sydney to Colombo. But then I had the rudest experience when I travelled back to Australia. The air hostess in my cabin were pretty rude. It's like they just want to get their job done and they don't care about the people. I've travelled a lot on different airlines and Ive never been treated so rudely.  They barely offer water to people.  I wanted the chicken as i do not eat beef and they wanted me to have the beef and when i said i can't. They took a long time (everyone else had finished eating) to find me some fish meal that wasn't on the menu.  I was grateful. However, that nice gesture didn't last for long. I literally opened my food to eat and the air hostess just dumps an ice cream (magnum) on my tray. Everyone else was happy to get theirs, but I had only begun (not even) eating! I had to gobble my food and eat the melting ice cream!  And on this very flight the air hostess serving me just took the cup in which there was apple juice remaining and poured me water. I also asked them for water when leaving the aircraft and they hesitated and made me stay the whole time until everyone left to get me the water (which was also a very small cup).  On a good note, I must say the flight is comfortable and good. And the food is acceptably good. I'd ask everyone who loves staying hydrated on flights to make sure they fill up their own water bottles."

The seats are comfortable and the sky bed opens flat for a good night’s sleep. The timing of this flight is great because it leaves at midnight and by the time dinner is served, it is between 2 to 3 am. This gives some adjustment to jet lag and arrives in Amsterdam in the morning. I started sneezing due to sinuses and the air stewardess promptly gave me a large pack of tissues, which came in handy. The entertainment selection was good - although I think Qatar is more current in terms of movie selection. Book the cook never fails. My bak chor mee came with vinegar on the side. For breakfast, I had the healthy red rice fish porridge, which doesn’t sound great but is really amazing. I started off to a busy work day well thanks to Singapore Airlines."

A380 configuration offers privacy even in economy class by dividing the cabin into sections. I would recommend the upper deck because of seat density and less engine noise. The legspace is okay but then I am a tall person. The cabin crew were excellent and the food served was of good quality though I believe they should make the main course portions larger, as EK does. Nothing was too much trouble for cabin staff and they made flight a pleasant experience by looking well after us. This flight reiterated my belief that SIA is the best!"

London to Singapore great service, enjoyable trip.  I cannot say the same about Singapore to Christchurch. I had a 12 hour stopover in Singapore, loved the  Silver Kris Lounge. Had a long walk to gate D10 but was good to shake off a little fatigue, but I was more than ready to sleep. I was most impressed with the 19K cubicle but saw no bedding. After takeoff I asked a hostess where do I get a blanket?"" she reach up and seemed to grasp one from somewhere. I had a fitful night and Journey with just a blanket and the cushion that was on the seat and could not settle. When the lights came on for breakfast I saw the guy across from me, fold up his bedding and seat! I asked the hostess why she had not showed me how to operate the bed, she replied ""its on the Video""! I told her as I could not operate the TV system how would I know that? I told her I would lay a complaint, I also talked to the man I assumed was in charge, he admitted he had seen me trying to rest/sleep, and assumed I slept like that! I have flown other airlines in Premium economy that took care of the elderly so much better, but as I decided this would be the last visit to the UK to see my sister before she forgets me, she has dementia, I decided it treat myself to business class return home, I had heard good things previously. I have to say, this was a very disappointing end,to a sad journey for me. I certainly would not recommend this airline."

Checking-in and boarding was quick and efficient, with a warm welcome on-board, as is the norm with Singapore Airlines. There is generous locker space in premium economy, sufficient to allow blankets, pillows etc not immediately required to be stowed. Drinks and nuts were served shortly after take off, with champagne offered, but unfortunately served in a tiny plastic faux champagne glass. We had ordered lunch from book the cook. The quality was good, but would be so much better if served on proper plates and not in foil dishes. It is unfortunate that Singapore provide only economy service in premium economy. Drinks were offered with the meal, but again served in small plastic tumblers. Wine was simply red or white, and of mediocre quality. No refills were offered, and when trays were collected some time later a requested refill never materialised. With a good choice of entertainment and a comfortable seat the 11 hour flight seemed to pass quite quickly. The crew came round on a number of occasions with water and fruit, and a second hot meal was provided 2 hours before landing. Overall it was a very pleasant flight. The small premium economy cabin is very pleasant, and the A350 is a very nice aircraft. However it is unfortunate that the enhanced level of service expected in premium economy is not provided."

Check in area was chaotic to say the least and I had to label my own baggage prior to drop off. The Kris Lounge is a shared lounge and it was bursting at the seems, basically no seating, therefore had to go to local coffee shop. The service onboard was not what I expected from a 5 Star airline like Singapore Airlines. I would put the service down to being pretty poor and with an old aircraft to match. The only really good thing I can say was that the Wi-Fi was good. I expected much more from Singapore Airlines considering they are 5 Star and have recently won the coveted Skytrax Award for best airline."

It was my first time taking SIA, and was not a memorable one. The inflight service is nothing to shout out about. Seating comfort is average. Cabin crews were not that warm, they are just doing their job. The in-flight entertainment is so-so. Non-english movies come without English subtitle. My biggest frustration is the quality of food. I am Muslim and pre-ordered the Muslim special meal. On SIN-HND route, as we flew at night and it was mid-long haul, we were given snack around 2 hours after departure. I was just served a piece of cake while the others got a sandwich. However, the crew was kind enough to offer me a vege sandwich. While flight en route HND-SIN, was more surprising. I got on board around 9.15am, and we had lunch served around 4.5 hour after departure, without being served snack. They offered us peanuts and juice 2 hours after departure. All in all, I do not find SIA is accommodating enough but they  offer good price for the ticket."

This is my 2nd flight in a week that is delayed by an hour (my last was late by 90 minutes). SQ used to be reliable and comfortable. In today’s delay of 55 minutes, nobody bothered to walk around to give anyone water or juice. After take off, pre-dinner drinks service no longer comes with the trolley. Passengers have a choice of water, juice or beer from the tray. When did SQ downgrade it’s drink service to European standards? Cabin service overall was good. Food is average. However, the cost cutting measures of SQ is highly visible. I still have a few more business class flights booked till the end of the year but with such bad reliability in schedule, I am switching after this year."

Flight was due to depart late, but the delay was further compounded at the airport due to cargo unloading. In the end, we departed over 90 minutes after the original time. For some reason, safety video was loud in the economy cabin and then turned up even louder. We had to cover our ears. Service was inconsistent - most cabin staff were good, one was particularly curt. We arrived in Singapore with only 30 minutes to the time our connecting flight departed. The ground staff tried really hard to get us into the connecting flight - but the Malaysia Airlines counter was closed and we missed our flight because we could not get our boarding passes. We were rebooked onto a SilkAir flight the next morning with hotel vouchers to stay at the Crowne Plaza, plus dinner and breakfast included. SQ also contacted the hotel to extend their buffet opening hours to 11pm to accommodate us. Despite the frustration of missing a flight, Singapore Airlines delay management team has done very well to make things smooth. We still felt looked after having missed a flight. The delay management staff who helped us out was very impressive."

I have flown SQ business class many times before but this is the first time I have experienced such terrible service. Was particularly disappointed with the food and beverage service, and availability of cabin crew. I had requested Thai chicken curry and rice for supper, but changed my mind and requested the FA to wake me up for breakfast. I woke up just as they were serving breakfast and I requested breakfast. About 20 min later, one of the FA's served my the Thai chicken curry and rice. I was a bit shocked and told her that I requested breakfast, not supper, to which she replied they can serve only one meal to pax, and since I hadn't eaten this for supper, they brought it to me for breakfast. What? Only one meal in business class on a 13h 30m flight? And they say normal breakfast (you know toast, cereals and orange juice) is not available? Absolutely ridiculous. Not acceptable, especially in business class. Also, once they served supper (or breakfast), they went into the galley/crew rest area and never came out, and during the entire 13h 30m journey they did not even offer water to any of the pax. Again, this is not acceptable, not anywhere, let alone business class. Extremely disappointed with SQ, really did not expect them to be so lax. Will be flying the competition from now on, they just lost a customer."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Singapore to Los Angeles,September 2019,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,2.0,3,no,2,"  I don't understand why people say SQ is the best airline in the world. The service has really gone downhill in the past 5 years. I was traveling with my 10 month old daughter and husband on the non-stop from Singapore to LA (round trip). The flight attendants don't pay attention to details. They say they will wash baby bottles, but they hand back the bottle with milk still in it. So I had to request to wash the bottles myself (thankfully they allowed this). We ordered the ""Book the Cook"" meals, but the flight attendant didn't look up our info so they tried to serve us regular meals. When I told them we ordered ""Book the Cook"" meals they asked us what we ordered. I couldn't remember. Between the two of us that's 8 meals on 2 different flights that I booked in advance. If I knew I had to bring confirmation of the meal request, I would have done that.  They heated up my daughter's meal without asking so it had to be thrown away because it needs to be consumed within one hour and she was sleeping because the flight was a night flight. The seats are uncomfortable for a 16 hour flight. I feel that economy plus seats for a long-haul flight should recline more. Also, the seats were really difficult for me to recline. When we boarded the plane, there was no bottled water in the water holders. Overall, it was just underwhelming. The price wasn't too bad considering it was Economy Plus and a non-stop flight to LA. I think the airline has good ideas, they just are executed properly by their staff."

The windows are new - no screens, but simply dim according to 1 of 6 settings. Even in economy, we have a USB charging port, which is a plus. Food was average. We had a choice between a western and an Asian dish. The servings were generous, and we ate from a tray with metal utensils - which is a big plus considering the number of airlines that feed us out of cupboard. Entertainment was relatively good - although not as good as Qatar Airways selection. Service still lives up to its name. Given the price of economy class, this was a decent enough ride for 4.5 hours."

Brisbane to Singapore on the late night flight. Boarding was on time and proceeded smoothly, with the usual warm welcome from the cabin crew. The seating and space is good, as expected in premium economy, with ample locker space. The seats include a leg support which is ineffective, and the footrest is not very good. There are no pre-flight drinks, unlike other airlines premium economy, and the water bottles had not been put out into the holders. This seems to be a hit and miss affair, sometimes the bottles in place on boarding, and other times only handed out later. Having water available immediately at least compensates to some degree for the lack of pre-take off drinks. Drinks were served with the meal shortly after take off, and again the Singapore attitude to premium economy is apparent. Food is the same as economy served on plastic trays, with no linen or crockery. Drinks are served in plastic tumblers. SQ advertise champagne available throughout the flight, and serve a good quality champagne, but in a tiny plastic tumbler. Service starts in premium economy, but the same crew carry on through economy, and trays remain until service is complete, and no drink refills are offered in the meantime. Water bottles were eventually handed out after meal service. Singapore economy class service is probably the best in the world, and on this flight the crew were superb. Unfortunately they do not seem to be committed to premium economy, and the enhancements which are provided by their competitors are absent. The primary justification for the “premium” price is space and comfort, which is provided, but having paid a not insignificant premium on the fare the expectation of an improved service level does not seem unreasonable. Overall the flight was good, with a superb crew, and it is unfortunate that SQ do not match other airlines with their premium economy service."

I was quite excited about flying the Singapore Airlines A350 in Premium Economy class. I chose the bulkhead (an additional $130 USD over the regular Premium Economy fare) as my seat.  I was disappointed with the seat. It was barely wider than an Economy Class seat, the leg rest might as well be non existent (it only extends about 3 inches), and there’s no dedicated lavatory for Premium Economy. Not to mention, the meals and cabin service are the same as Economy. Their so called Noise Canceling headphones aren’t noise canceling at all. I will pay extra for Premium Economy on EVA or Air Canada, but never again on Singapore Airlines."

I missed getting an amenities kit as I had gone to use the lavatory. After mentioning this to a FA he went to get one however they had run out. So he tracked down every individual item, even going to business class for it to make sure I’d get a kit. The services are excellent; you get two hot towels, a blanket and a pillow, snacks and more. The seats are reasonably comfortable for economy and the in flight entertainment is expansive. The toilets are cleaned and stocked with dental kits. While more foot room and further reclining seats are always desirable, that’s never going to change in economy class.  I will fly Singapore Airlines again."

I have taken SQ many times and each time is a little worse than the flight before. This flight was on time and passengers were boarded according to section. I was lucky that there was a spare seat between myself and the guy with the aisle seat. Once we took off, the passenger in front reclined (day flight) and it sure makes economy feel so squeezy. Unlike their promise on the website that you won’t be packed like sardines, you are. I can’t eat fish but I guess SQ decided to save money by incorporating all allergies. My breakfast was gluten free (revolting hard dry roll), no dairy and no sugar. I was appalled by it compared to the normal breakfast. I am glad I brought snacks like chocolate and cookies. The selection of entertainment was fine and the toilets are kept clean. However paying so much more to go with SQ I expected the standards to be maintained not reduced. I think I will only base future travel on price as this so called great airline is not so great."

✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Business,Economy Class,Singapore to Adelaide,October 2019,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1,no,5,"  Singapore to Adelaide. I dont know what happened to Singapore Airlines but just had my worst Economy flight ever. I am on the tall side with over 1.90cm but have had no issues on this flight over the decades on A310/A340/777/A330 in Eco and the occasional Biz class. My 1st time on their new A350-900 with their new economy seating and will be my last. The legroom is non existent.  My knees were in constant contact with the seat infront. If the person infront of you decides to recline then you get to enjoy the screen about 20cm from your face. The seats are an absolute nightmare. Not only is the pitch terrible but also the width which is a complete joke. If you are travelling with a family member then fine otherwise you get to enjoy constant shoulder rubbing with your neighbour. The seat padding is the hardest i have come across. Having flown Thai's A350-900 the weekend before to Bangkok in standard eco seat as well and having no issues, I was looking forward to the SQ experience. What an incredible let down that was. The Thai product is so much better which is something i would have thought I would never say when comparing to SQ. Even Emirates a few months before in Economy was an absolute joy in comparison. The inbound flight was a 23:10 departure and our dinner consisted of a beverage and a packet of peanuts before lights were turned off. 4 hours later breakfast was served which consisted of yoghurt, a bit of fruit, bread roll and flavourless noodles or omelette. Not being able to sleep, you had to play catch the crew walking past if you wanted water. Not being heavyset, the tray actually pushed into my stomach when folded out which was also a new experience. On the return leg I managed to get the extra legroom seat in row 55 which was fine legroom wise but it was even more narrow then the standard seat as the tray folds out of the armrest taking up width. Compared to the standard economy seat this one is bearable for the 7 hours but again, not for anything longer. Whilst boarding and scanning the ticket the ground staff in ADL remarked"" oh, I am glad you got that seat as you are tall"". Whilst on board and having settled into the seat, the steward's pre-empted my seat neighbour's and my comment with ""yeah i know, they are very narrow"" so I can imagine the number of complaints about their seats. My neighbour and I, whilst trying to avoid shoulder contact had a lengthy discussion about how terrible these SQ seats have become. I will be exploring other carriers and connections in future as the premium paid for Singapore Airlines is simply not there anymore. Reading the number of gripes on the web about their Biz seats as well, I will be sure to choose other carriers in the future which saddens me as have been flying Singapore Airlines my entire life and had them in the highest regard until now but wont be enduring this torture ever again. I have absolutely no idea how they were voted best airline again."

After having the experienced the most arrogant crew ever on an SQ Business Class I have chosen Star Alliance Alternatives such as Asiana and ANA for my recent flights and I have not been disappointed at all, but for my flight to India, there was not viable option, so I went back to SQ and was disappointed again. They are dropping standards. The 2 passengers besides me had to suffer dropping water from the overhead cabinets without any solution, my food was lousy, I found the legroom below the standard of above mentioned airlines. The booking procedure is like a low cost where they are charging up to 10% of the total ticket price for a front row seat.

One thing that must be corrected is the attitude of their ground staff at Hong Kong Airport (HKG), which is a little less friendly to serve passengers, even though there is only one staff like that but the adverse effects can be comprehensive. But I still thank Singapore Airlines for giving me new tickets for free even though the late arrival to the airport was purely my own fault. All cabin crew on this flight were very friendly.

This is probably the best thing about SingAir. Boarding is also a quick process. Most of the planes are a bit aged. Thus the screen or the audio jack may not work. The newer planes have better legroom. Although I always sneeze whenever I ride their planes, therefore the seats may not be disinfected regularly. They try to have a variety of dishes, but if you ride SingAir frequently, you will notice that the names of the dishes may change but the taste is just the same. I always like their salads. The crew do their job like clockwork, and that's about it just like an automatic clock. No personalised service, no understanding the needs of the passengers. I've been to a lot of flights with SingAir and you may have 1 or 2 passengers who can be a bit demanding and needy, but the rest are understanding. Frequent flyers know that they have a hundred and million things to do, but being an attendant is like a profession just like being a doctor who commits himself/herself to every patient under their care. That is the demand of the job. Lastly, it is very rare that SingAir flights are delayed, but in the rare occasions that they are, SingAir does not offer provisions for passengers who are inconvenienced by it. We don't need fancy hotels but maybe a space where we can relax other than the airport chairs or offer a massage or offer a meal or drink. Other airlines do that, why can't SingAir? Overall, SingAir is still a good airline if you are not very particular about things like the attendants being sensitive and aware that passengers are people that they should be taking care of or that the food tastes the same even though the names are different or hey don't offer anything to passengers who are inconvenienced with the delays."

Toilet just a pair of toilet at back and front toilet though free reserved for business class seats, they didn't let me use it as economy class passenger. There was no TV on return flight and used mobile app to view their movies, limited food option and lack of consistency in service makes me not go on this airline unless to a route that has Singapore as destination for good service and flights are generally scheduled for it Air Asia though less options has better food choices or at least 1-2 very good choices to buy.

The cabin service was fine, the flight was uneventful. I went to a great deal of time and trouble with Singapore Airline Officials in setting us up 6 months in advance with a seat choice that would accommodate my elderly mother being close to the lavatory. More than one phone call was made in a bid to secure a satisfactory response for this return and the outgoing flight on June 5. We ended up so far from where we wanted to be that the contempt I have for Airline Officials is significant. How on earth does an elderly infirm woman make her way to the back row when the walking device she uses is not allowed to come with her. I repeated many times that we would need an Aisle Chair, yet this was noticeably absent each time we boarded. Only after holding up the boarding, did an Aisle chair become available. I was so incensed after the first flight that I contacted SIA and told them what I really thought and their reaction for the return flight confirmed my long-held belief that this airline is only after my money and once that was in their possession - anything goes. Well I am not going to forget the battles I have had and the ignorance and contempt their administration has demonstrated on every occasion. They have lost me. The in-flight Service cannot override my sentiments. Do not bother if you are anything but a passenger who is happy to hand over your money and accept great service when your basic requests are treated so poorly. The Admin team is inept and say ""Yes"" to every request yet failed to deliver. The cabin crew could not believe the admin ignored me until I showed them the emails. But it is no good to say sorry as the apology is inflammatory given the disadvantage that my mother was placed in, and not to mention the inconvenience to others which I dutifully tried to avoid. The damage is already done."

I spent time establishing parameters for which my elderly mother could get a seat close to the lavatory and after many calls direct to Singapore I had confirmation that the range of seats we would get was limited but acceptable. I got this in an email. At boarding, it became clear the layout for our flight was vastly different to that which had been shown previously. She was as far from the lavatory as she could be. Other passengers could not pass us in the aisle and the journey to the lavatory took 10 minutes with the turbulence we encountered. No aisle seats was available in Business class despite a prior agreement that one would be aboard. I may as well have not bothered dealing with the airline. That SIA failed to deliver on this flight and the ensuing return later, shows the customer what the airline think of even their Business Class passengers - absolutely nothing. There is little their superb in-flight service did to improve the bitter resentment on my part. I expected much better after the initial discussions, I got contempt."

Blown away by how amazing Singapore airlines is. Food was great for airline food, and the staff were amazing. Even though there were some annoying people on second leg being really rude and unreasonable (demanding coffee when water was being served, insisting they get to move seats because they were cold and yelling when staff told them they couldn’t) - the staff were courteous even though the customers were being so rude. Also the online service via email is fast and super helpful. They are simply the best airline I’ve flown."

Once entering aircraft was greeted by friendly cabin crew who showed me to my seat, came around and gave me headphones and eye shades. With my status, I was given a whole row to myself and the crew gave me business-class quality hot towel and headphones. The aircraft, being 15 days old at the time of flying, had a fast touchscreen monitor. The toilets were stocked with free amenities, including toothbrush and toothpaste. Crew took my order first, food choices sweet and sour pork or steamed fish. I chose the pork, was so delicious.  Delicious Turkish pide, couscous salad, and bread roll. I was also given an activity pack (although really not for my age still a nice touch), which featured a deck of cards and some crayons. KrisWorld lounge was a bit crowded even at midnight, with a stream of people waiting to connect.  The seat was plush and featured adjustable headrest, footrest and much more. Probably my favourite are the little storage pockets you will find under the seat - one is shaped perfectly for your passport and phone, and the other for your boarding pass and immigration cards. However the WiFi is very overpriced, cannot believe that they are charging $20 for some 100MB of data- Scoot is cheaper at $18. Would also have liked to see some more new and blockbuster movies on the iFE, was a bit disappointed."

The seat was very comfortable, and had a generous 8 inches of recline. There was also a nice reading light next to the seat. The TV screen was huge and itwas really responsive. There was also a nice footrest. If you choose a window seat from rows 40-44, you get a huge compartment for storage. This was SQ33 and had only business and premium economy seats. An hour after take off the first meal was served, and I chose the Korean beef short rib. This was really good. I used the online Book the Cook to choose the meal, which was a great service. The menu also included an amenity kit with some really soft eye mask, a toothbrush, a comb, and some socks on request. In the back at the galley there was a self serve snack bar. Also there are 2 free checked bags with SQ premium economy. They served some snacks in the middle of the flight for those who were still awake, and I got an apple. They also handed out water bottles in the beginning of the flight, which was very generous. Then in the morning I got breakfast, some noodles and pork, and that was really good. The selection for the TV was really nice too, and it included a ton of Marvel including endgame."

Senator lounge service was extremely poor. We did not feel welcome neither at arrival, neither inside. Wines (of low quality) are not in self-service, quantity served in glasses are severely controlled and personnel (when present) showed agressivity to all customers. Food was inedible (overcooked minced pork), with no other choice. Wi-Fi did not work well. Bad service could also be testified at boarding where LH personnel showed bad mood and did not respect the usual SQ procedures with obvious privileges for their Miles &More passengers. On the other hand we were pleased by the new seats on A350. Plane is fabulous, service was top-notch. We did not want to leave that plane. It is shocking to see that both airlines are quoted 5 stars. LH has a long long way to go to get there."

Not Verified ,A380,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Zurich via Singapore,August 2019,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,1.0,1,no,1,  We have flown multiple times via Singapore airlines and on each occasion we have had an issue of some kind usually related to seats and Singapore ground staff. Despite complaints directly to the airline I always feel I am wasting my time so I might as well go public with a review. The cabin is nearly always nice and the service is generally good although I have previously been left unable to eat as the only food left has been noodles with prawns and I have an allergy to prawns. On this occasion however we booked our tickets in business class and now that we attempt to select seats we are told we are unable to select the seat. The options are single seats spread around the cabin with no option to sit close to each other over a 12+ hour flight - that said we are still unable to book. We booked the tickets 10 months ago and I refuse to accept we were the last people to book this flight. We have contacted customer services to receive the answer seats are subject to availability. While I can accept that there are limitations on seating we are in advance of online check-in and were just checking available seats of which there are half a dozen dotted around the cabin. To be effectively told tough luck for a $5000 seat is just not acceptable. Unless you are flying alone I would not recommend Singapore airlines. They are totally inflexible in everything they do and do not have any understanding of passenger needs.

Boarding was efficient and strictly adhered too which was great especially when some passengers tried to barge in. Economy is quite tight especially when the person in front reclines immediately for the whole flight. You have to recline yourself then otherwise your screen is right in your face. Was surprised not to get hot towels before take off and before landing. I guess cost cutting? No big deal but it used to be a nice touch. The toilets were kept clean with toothbrushes/paste sets in there, lotions ... that’s always nice. The flight attendants were run off their feet on this full flight but were still charming and sweet. The food probably was not as nice as my previous flights with them, the snack was awful. Again, its economy and expectations are never high. My advice is to bring your own snacks. Entertainment options were very good and we arrived in Singapore early too. I love SQs efficiency and reliability, friendly FAs and cleanliness."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Auckland,August 2019,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,4.0,4,yes,6," We travelled from Singapore to Auckland in seats 41A and 41B with extra legroom. The seats were bulkhead and were okay. However, I have a complaint about passengers bringing on too much luggage as they call these seats last when you get on the plane. All the overhead lockers are full of other passengers bags - we had to put our luggage at least 6 compartments down from where we were sitting. A worry when I had all our passports etc in one of the bags as on take-off we could not have a bag near us and no seats to put it under. My major complaint is that as we were the first row after the Premium compartment and when meals etc were served they were served from the other end of the plane - we were last to be served. No offer of pre-dinner drinks (I had to get up and ask the crew after our meals were served). We had no choice in dinner we had what was left! Chicken! At breakfast the same happened all there was left was noodles and beef. I said to the crew I would like the scrambled egg please and he said it had all gone. I said I did not want noodles for breakfast so off he went and minutes later he brought scrambled egg dish. They forgot my husband and after 10 minutes they came with a breakfast meal. Why on earth do they give you a flash menu if they can't serve you what you want? All in all a disappointing flight I always put Singapore Airlines in high regards but not this time. Such a pity - maybe the crew were just overworked. I would recommend if there was no alternative."

It was my first time on Singapore Airlines and I had pretty high hopes for the airline, and they were mostly fulfilled. The crew were very nice and clear about situations going on inflight. Considering I was flying economy, I would give them a good pass. Before boarding, the staff at the gate were pretty excited to welcome passengers. The seats were comfortable though my headrest was rather broken as its height was not adjustable. I enjoyed the seat pockets (you can organise your stuff pretty well) and everything felt good in quality. I also enjoyed the inflight entertainment. The screen was massive and clear and everything was responsive. The selection of movies was also really good with many rather recent movies. They provided an earphone adapter so you could use your own earphones easily when using the inflight entertainment. They distributed a menu before take-off. The food was quite good though my seat neighbours did not like it as much as I did. They provided drinks throughout the 12-hour flight. What I was surprised about, though, is that you can use your roaming data on the flight! In this case, you wouldn't need to purchase to the expensive onboard WiFi but instead, just subscribe for internet through your own data service provider. The A350 itself was also really enjoyable to fly with. Comfortable, spacious, large windows and rather quiet."

Early morning flight to Jakarta, on the A350-900, with a 3-class configuration. The overall ambience of the cabin is bright and airy, and the newest version of the in-flight entertainment is a big bonus for this short hop flight. Seating is comfortable for this duration of flight (way better than the experience in an A320 or B737). We left on time, and the crew were then rushing to serve breakfast. Food was reasonably good (omelette or nasi lemak), and we landed on time also. Crew were a little rushed and courteous rather than friendly, but good enough. I appreciated that the crew were meticulous about asking passengers to raise their seats to the upright position for the meal service, small things like this help in economy."

This was our return journey on SQ406 (SIN-DEL) after we arrived in singapore 10 days before with them on SQ401 (which was definitely very good) Things took a U-turn here. The crew onboard was RUDE to the core. No courtsey, Zero on management. We were assigned seats at the end of the plane for 5 people. At the time of serving food, they served the entire plane before us, rows ahead of us and rows behind us, but did not offer us any food. after 2 hours of takeoff, with the entire plane almost dozed off after their meals, they came to us only to inform, they have no food available. Only 1 tray, that too with Fish. We were with a kid, hungry. Had we have known this, we would have had our own meal at the airport. On confronting them, they could only apologize. But somehow managed to get a veg tray from somewhere and we fed the little one. The entire journey we got nothing to eat! We travelled without meals.   6 hours journey. They had no remorse. Called them to serve water, they did not bother to serve it.  It was a nightmare of a flight. 4 of us were hungry throughout and were waiting for this nightmare to end as soon as possible. We could have done online checkin and booked our meals beforehand, but with the child, this is not possible to do so online and we had to do a manual checkin. Was this our fault? I don't think so."

I had to play with my kids, draw and color using my phone flashlight, my wife feeding my 8mths old with her phone flashlight. This was Premium Economy seats that do not cost few dollars??  I complained and their response was, ""you received a voucher for the inconvenience and you rejected the two available seats.""  I understand some issues are out of their control such as the system not operating but a $110 for the inconvenience, also, on the way back, our system works, but other passengers experience the same. Completely disappointed with Singapore Airlines Customer Relations. Will not travel with them again."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Johannesburg to Singapore,August 2019,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,5.0,4,yes,7," Johannesburg to Singapore in premium economy on the recently introduced second flight. Priority boarding after business class allows time to settle in, with ample space in the overhead lockers. Just three rows in the cabin, with good legroom and comfortable seats, which have a decent recline. There is a footrest on the seat in front, and a calf rest attached to the seat, which seems to serve no purpose other than create problems for the crew in trying to them stowed for landing. Good sized TV screen which is easy to operate. Overall the hard product is good. However there is nothing premium about the service, which is strictly economy. There are no pre take-off drinks, and there was no bar service after take-off prior to the meal. This may have been due to the late hours departure and a wish to serve the meal as quickly as possible, but one would have thought that with a maximum of 24 in premium economy this would not have been a big issue. Amenity kits are no longer handed out, but the menu indicated they were available on request. Meals were tasty, but the same as economy, served on plastic trays. No sign of table cloths and proper crockery as shown on the website. Drinks are served in plastic as opposed to glasses, and in small quantities. Wine was a basic white or red in a small plastic tumbler half filled. Fruit juice slightly larger serving, but still meagre. No offers of refills until the trays were eventually removed. There are no dedicated crew in premium economy. Service starts with premium, but then proceeds through economy, with clearing starting at the back of economy, so that premium economy is the last to be cleared. With the time difference the second meal was lunch. This time I ordered champagne, served in a plastic stemmed “glass” amounting to half a normal glass, again no refills offered until trays cleared, at which time the champagne had disappeared from the trolly. The main reason for choosing premium economy is space and comfort, on which there are no complaints. However notwithstanding the fact that Singapore economy is amongst the best, it is not a premium economy service. Having chosen to pay a significant premium over economy, it is disappointing that the enhancements provided by other airlines are not provided."

I have flown many times with economy airlines such as Jetstar and AirAsia. But my first ever flights with Singapore Airlines which I had high hopes for were a washout. The economy seats are much smaller than AirAsia and all you are getting for your extra dollars is a menu and entertainment options. Also I have an injury and asked for help getting on and off the plane before the crush. They made me get a medical certificate to prove the injury but let me on with every one else. And with a broken foot those small seats were even worse. I will return to AirAsia for future flights.

However, among all of it, it has always been the late departure over and over is the one that I think is the biggest pain."

The seats, toilets, catering was ok but the crew seemed to be quite inattentive and the economy class on that A380 was old and shabby.  Other than that, food seems to be great but my flight had a 30min delay due to a drone flying around at Changi Airport 2nd runway so there was a single runway operation. Other than that it was great so thanks Singapore Airlines."

BKK to SIN on a newish B789 with a great new Business Class seat; comfortable and great IFE with a large HD touchscreen screen. Lounge in Singapore a rather mediocre experience, overcrowded with average food offerings. SQ lounge in BKK was much better. The big disappointment of this trip was the ancient B772 on the SG to IST sector. It was the very old business class seat which is very very uncomfortable. IFE was poor due to the small non touch screen. As usual, no amenity kit, the fresh flowers in the washrooms have been replaced by tacky plastic flowers. It is very hard to understand why the airlines provides a really good hardware product on a 2h flight, but is not able to do the same on a 11h overnight flight. Service and food on both flights was just average. SQ does not even come close to the business class product of Qatar Airways which I usually fly long haul."

Overall great experience and Singapore definitely have satisfied us. Upon boarding a hot towel was served. The seat was quite soft, reasonably wide and the legroom was above average. Two full meals were provided on the Melbourne to Singapore sector which was some of the highest quality airline food I have experienced in Economy Class, complemented by the usage of metal cutlery and the ice cream dessert. The only drawback from the flight would be the rather inconvenient Wi-Fi service with pretty much unacceptable pricing for the average user, although on-board SMS and calls were provided, given your carrier supports it on their side. Overall a great experience and does seem to be worth paying a little bit extra for."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787 / A330,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Bangkok,July 2019,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4.0,4,yes,7,"  Singapore to Bangkok return. In the past 10 year or so, we can clearly see many once premium airlines in the world have to resort to cost cutting, due to keen competition from low cost carriers and many other factors. Haven't not been on economy class of Singapore for quite some time, I decided to try it for it's a short haul flight plus it's price factor was very good this time. The usual high standard of SIA is there with the immaculately groomed kebaya-clad crew, and the good condition of the plane and its amenities etc. Hot towel service is still provided in economy class which is a nice touch. Menu is not given since it's a short sector. Hot drinks, cold beverages and meals are all served in one go, which cuts time and makes good sense. However, one can clearly see some cost cutting with the portion of the meal smaller, and the taste was rather bland and mediocre. Boeing 787 on the way to BKK was a fine plane, except the seat pitch and the aisle are all very narrow. Sat at the aisle, I was constantly bumped by the crew and passengers, there's almost nowhere foe me to hide as I wild be spilling onto my neighbour's space. It's quite frustrating really. Also the tray table is so close to my stomach, it's uncomfortable to say the least. Touch screen AVOD was very good, and pre-ordered duty free was dully delivered without delay. On return, SIA has a good lounge on concourse D of BKK airport, which is very close to the boarding gate, D6 or 7. A330, despite being an older plane, actually offered more seat pitch and slightly more space. No touch screen this time. The catering from BKK was better than from SIN. Overall, SIA still manage to being one of the top airlines in the world despite some cost cutting. Take advantage of their promotions, which can sometimes beat the budget airlines by the hands down."

Good food. But cannot understand how this, one of the best airline in the world, has ignored the plight of thousands of travellers who order special meal for so long. The problem is neither with the food nor the service standard of the crew. It is to do with the processes of serving the special meals. Special meals are first served. But no drinks are offered or served on demand. Either one should wait until the remaining passengers are served food with drinks and get a drink and let the nice food sit on the tray and let it get cold. Or eat the food without any drinks, not even water. Singapore Airline should change its processes so thst the crew should bring the same trolley containing the selection of drinks while serving the special meal and offer the same selection of drinks to passengers being served special meal."
Not Verified ,A350-900,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Athens via Singapore,July 2019,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,2,no,2,"  Such terrible service from the outset! After making the booking which included a code share arrangement for 2 adults with an infant, everything started well with a bassinet being requested. From that point I had to call at least four times with apparent issues with the names on itinerary even though they were correct from the outset. This issue arises again upon attempting online check in which wasn’t at all possible because one adults name was somehow written in twice, once as a Mr and one as a Mrs. called and requested a business class upgrade. Was told due to code share it wasn’t possible (hello I’m trying to give you my money)! Thereafter we arrived at the airport to a very rude staff member once again telling me the names were incorrect in the system, even though the night before I had the itinerary emailed to me from Singapore airlines customer call centre showing correct details, after the initial attempt to check in failed, which confirmed names were correct, I showed this document as proof, lady appeared uninterested. codeshare 2nd leg of journey had tickets produced at Melbourne airport by Singapore staff and after being flustered by this to and fro at check in I didn’t bother to check the seat allocation for the 2nd leg which didn’t have bassinet allocation. To our horror we discovered the Singapore Airlines check in lady had allocated us seats in different rows on opposite sides of the plane with a one year old! How can they be so unprofessional? The worst part, when transiting through SIN I approached the transfer counter of the codeshare airline, which is Singapore’s budget carrier Scoot and this helpful assistant was able to pair us together, making the MEL - SIN Singapore employees actions even worse. To top it off the flight wasn’t full, but also we cannot purchase additional baggage online due to once again the codeshare arrangement and furthermore we arrive at our final destination and discovered both our suitcases were broken with the wheels coming off before we exited the airport. Having flown many major international airlines overseas, I will never fly with Singapore again. It’s an indictment on Singapore Airlines that the service and experience on the 2nd leg operated by Scoot overall in SIN airport and on board was far superior to the Singapore airlines journey to SIN. If going Australia to Europe, I highly recommend you consider a Middle East airline that shows accountability and pride in their responsibility to fare paying passengers. My wife and I are absolutely appalled by the service we received from Singapore Airlines. We have made this same journey to Europe 7 times as leisure travellers in the last 8 years and this was by far the worst experience."

Singapore Airlines really delivers a best-in-class experience – seat, food, and entertainment were all fantastic.

Premium Economy really delivers a competitive product: notably more space and comfort than Economy without the expense or extra frills of Business (I'm 6'0"" and couldn't touch the bulkhead with my feet even when I stretched out and tried). Most comfortable Premium Economy seat I've tried."

The crew was polite but seemed disorganized. The quality of the food was reasonable. We ordered via book the cook but the main meal was served lukewarm and the meat was very dry and hard.

I travelled with my wife and 2 Daughters (2 and 4 years old) and we were assigned seats 19F and 20D and F. As the seats are very closed, we would have preferred to sit all in one row, so we asked at Check In to be seated in one row, either 19 or 20. They told us it was fully Business Class, but they will leave a note and we can check at the Gate. We did, but the passengers on the window seats did not want to move, which was OK to us as they have been faster than us, so it is OK. Upon closing of the doors, we saw that Seat 20K was free, so I asked the flight attendant if my wife can move then from 19F, so we can sit in one row. She said this is a cockpit seat and she needs to check with the pilot. Upon departure she came back and told us that the pilot does not want to change the seat to 19F or 21K. Really? A pilot who used this seat for 30 minutes does not want to move one row back to let a family with 2 Kids sit in one row? Maybe SQ needs to inform pilots who is paying their high salary."

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-10,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Singapore ,July 2019,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4,yes,7,"  Bangkok to Singapore . I was looking forward to flying Singapore Airlines and their new B787-10. I had set my expectations at the same level as Qatar Airways, seeing the fact that they are both 5-star airlines. With this in mind, I would firstly like to say that I was not impressed with Singapore Airlines, as they were quite inconsistent across the categories. The website is user-friendly, but I did encounter some glitches. Online check in is slightly confusing but I was able to manage. We arrived at Bangkok Airport 3.15 hours before our flight, and the check in counters opened 2.45 hours before the flight. It was extremely confusing which line is for which passenger, as they separate Business and Gold into different lines. In the end we were very quickly checked in at the gold counter. Luckily at that time of day security and immigration moved quickly. The Silverkris lounge in Bangkok is in a word, exquisite. The decor is very fancy and there is a manned bar with a barista making craft drinks and all sorts of coffee. Seats were plenty, clean and even the toilets are cleaned after every use! The breakfast buffet was slightly disappointing, but I have come to expect that with all airlines. Boarding was extremely confusing, they asked gold members to queue up with business class but the sign asks them to queue up at the economy door. Not only that, they board business class passengers first then gold members, which makes a mess! Other Star Alliance carriers just board gold and business at the same time. Hassle free! I received a warm welcome at the door, and found my seat. The flight attendant was even kind enough to help my mum lift her suitcase into the overhead compartment! I would never expect a flight attendant to do it out of the blue! The seat was, in a word, horrible. It was so narrow! Qatar Airways also has 3-3-3 seating on their 787s, but it wasn't this narrow. I'm slightly large, but even my rather small mum sat shoulder-to-shoulder with the other passenger in the window seat! Legroom was fine. What I don't get is that these aircraft with small seats are being deployed on flights as far as Brisbane, an 8 hour hop. However, the bad seat was overshadowed by the service. On my outbound flight from Bangkok, I chose a seafood meal and got the same thing I get all the time flying Star Alliance out of Bangkok, mixed grilled seafood served with tomatoes, peas and duchess potatoes. The catering was provided by Thai Airways, and even had the Thai Airways logo on it. Needless to say, it was very nice. On my return flight, when coming around for drinks, the lovely flight attendant noticed me checking the white wine bottle to see what it was, and I love the way she asked if I wanted the Sauvignon Blanc rather than""white wine.  The crew on Singapore Airlines are fantastic, and very hardworking. Entertainment was adequate, I wouldn't be bored even on the longest flight. On the return flight, we checked in 7 hours before departure time as we wanted to explore Jewel. Absolutely recommended. The gold lounge in Terminal 2 was an absolute disappointment! Even the Thai Airways lounge in T1 is better! Other than that, this flight was almost identical, except for some very strong turbulence. Overall, Singapore Airlines is a good choice. If they can improve their seat and value their star gold more, I would be a returning customer."

Probably the worst crew I ever had, very inattentive. It was very hard to get any attention at all (the attendant button at your seat was completely useless, no reaction by the crew whatsoever) I had 2 drinks in a 12 hour flight. I wasn't asked for a drink with our meals and the meals unfortunately didn't save the day either. Most of the time we had to queue at the lavatory (the layout of the plane for PE is horrible), because the 2 lavatories were used by Economy as well. The lavatory situation in Economy was much better, nobody surely had to queue there (11 lavatories according to the seat map!). It didn't help that a family with two toddlers and a crying baby was sitting in the same row. On the positive side were the headphones (even if they had to replace my headphones straightaway) and the entertainment system. Avoid booking Premium Economy with Singapore Air, you have a better deal in Economy (or Business of course). Another weird point was that Economy class was disembarking before Premium Economy, another novelty for me. There are much better Premium Economy products out there."

On a seven-hour flight, only one meal served. For a premium full-service airline to do these things in disappointing. Competition on this route provides better catering options.

I foolishly left my video gaming device on the seat next to mine and only found out after I reached my hotel. I panicked and called up the ground handler for Singapore Airlines and never got through via the phone number provided on the website even after 22 times. However I called up the Singapore Airlines Krisflyer hotline and the sweetest lady reassured me and told me they would log a request to check the aircraft for the item, her kind tone and understanding nature really helped soothe my nerves and gave me some peace of mind. Half way through my trip I got the news that my item was found and I could collect it before leaving Sydney. As much as I will strive to be less careless, I am so glad that I could count on the customer-oriented culture and all-round excellence and efficiency that the SQ team has displayed in the times where I slip up. A big thank you for everyone from the customer service team to the ground handler for reuniting me with my lost item!"

Flight attendants were really helpful throughout the whole flight. Although it was a full flight, the flight attendants paid a lot of attention to detail to serve the passengers. One of the flight attendants helped find ways to keep a hand carry item for a passenger somewhere as the flight was packed and had no available space for her item. They kept her updated on how the item was as the item was ""fragile"". My mom told me that she felt that SIA kept their standards as the last time she flown with SIA was 16 years ago. Overall, I had a very pleasant and enjoyable flight."

Food was delicious I had Indian vegetarian meal and great improvement to last time. The old A380’s are the best, so comfortable, the new ones have uncomfortable cramped seats that I cannot sleep on not as wide as the old ones. Also not sure what the problem is with the cabin air but every time I’m in the new planes there’s a smell from the toilets. Arrived feeling as though I hadn’t flown some 10000 miles."

The cushion was depressed so you are left sitting on a hard bench. Entertainment system rarely works and the crew don't care about anything.

As a Singaporean, I am utterly disappointed and disgraced by the service standards of the SQ Crew. After take off, the first meal was served. The stewardess briskly shoved us our meal trays and asked if I want any beverages with my meal. I replied with my choice of beverage (coffee). She simply walked away after acknowledging my request without saying anything at all. I thought maybe she didn't have coffee on her tray so she went to get some. But she never returned. I was appalled by this. Next was snack time. A different stewardess came with the snack tray ask if we would like any snacks. As my sister was hungry and we saw on the menu that sandwiches and wraps was available in the snack menu, I requested for a sandwich/wrap. The stewardess reply was a brusque ""I don't have any, I'll check"" and she too walked away without coming back. What ever happened to our friendly SQ crew? I was shocked by their attitude and more shocked that it seems SQ crew have short term memory loss. Twice they did not come back to me and left me hanging. "

The Melbourne to Wellington flight is an early morning flight, arriving in Wellington in the afternoon just in time for most hotel check-ins. The short-haul international flight serves one round of meals with 4 options for mains available. I went for the cheese omelette and it was great. Cabin service was exceptional as usual. However, the aircraft itself is very dated, especially the seats. The seats are in a 2-2-2 configuration, and it's not the best Singapore Airlines Business Class seats. It's okay for the short-haul flight, as they turn into flat-angled beds. There's lots of leg space and decent width. In-flight entertainment technology was dated, but the content is good in terms of library and variety. All in all, it's definitely the best Melbourne-Wellington offering (when compared to narrow-bodied aircrafts of Qantas, Virgin Australia and Air New Zealand), but it's not the best SQ offering."

I am not sure I can rave about the service on this flight relative to the other Singapore Airlines flights I have taken. The stewardess just got on the side step of my seat to shut the overhead lockers without warning. Yes - I may be in economy, but just let me know. Seat is average - because no one was next to me, I found the flight fairly comfortable and was able to get a few hours of sleep. Food was also quite good but again, the stewardess forgot to give me a bread roll but only the butter and I had to remind them. Despite the small hiccups with service, the flight is good for economy class standards. I will fly Singapore Airlines again."

We had really been looking forward to the new A359 taking over from the old 777 on the Christchurch to Singapore route with the choice of premium economy. Unfortunately, the bean counters seem to have designed the cabin! The configuration is 2x4x2 — just one seat less than economy — compared with 2x3x2 for Lufthansa in premium economy in the same type of aircraft, which we enjoyed for the next leg of our trip to Europe. The lavatories are the size of a small cupboard and there is no space to get up and stretch your legs in the cabin, unlike earlier aircraft. Going over was OK in the two seats by the window, but as others have pointed out, the central armrest and padded seatbelt (it contains an airbag) intrude on space. Inflight food and service was fine, if not memorable. Coming back overnight stuck in the middle seats was a lot worse. Space feels very tight. Not all menu choices were available, and we got beef mince, which was not very good at all. We asked for eggs for breakfast but got yam cake. A gentleman two seats along turned on his overhead lamp at about 3:00 am (he should have used the reading lamp). No eyeshades or earplugs provided. We asked for some but still got no sleep. Screens didn't work for two of the passengers in front of us. This flight ended up being diverted because of fog, adding six hours to the nine hour flight (of course, not SIA’s fault) but the whole experience was very tiring. One other thing: Electronic check-in at Changi was confusing and everyone had to ask what step to do next. It should be much clearer. We have flown with SIA for 35 years and feel they are trading on their past good reputation and really need to lift their game. Premium economy on SIA really isn’t worth the extra cost. It doesn’t feel special at all. We’d probably look at Air NZ or another airline next time."

Very happy with the shopping selection for Jun to Aug - the Sulwhasoo selection onboard has expanded again!

First flight with Singapore Airlines in Premium Economy and what a disappointment. It had little to differentiate it other than a little more space. I ordered via book the cook which was a nice feature although my meal was delivered first and in asking for a drink, I was told to wait a while. I asked how long that would be and was told 2 mins and then it was suggested I drink the plastic cup of water given. Very cheap and nasty especially considering there was no drink on boarding or pre-dinner. 15 mins or so later the drinks arrived by which time my meal was cold but on my request they reheated it (another wait). The red wine was awful. Throughout the flight the curtains to Economy remained open so that didn't make you feel the extra expensive brought any benefit. The seat was not comfortable and the IFE was so poor I watched content from my PC. FA's were polite but not really interested. The 380 interiors felt old and indeed first impressions were of a budget airline. All in all poor value."

Crew are a mixed bag - some attendants were friendly and helpful like the purser and supervisor and one attendant who went out of her way and offered to move me from my seat next to a crying baby and family to an empty cluster of 3 seats, 10 rows back before takeoff which was very kind of her. However, some attendants are grumpy and have zero manners. The seat feels exactly the same as a 10 in a row 777-300 on Cathay. Fairly acceptable for someone my height at 5’2 but could be uncomfortable for anyone bigger and on a longer flight. Food was terrible - fish was overcooked and the dessert was rubbery. Should have brought my own dinner instead. Only consolation was the Singapore sling and Bailey's I consumed that was not diluted with ice cubes. Hot towel before takeoff is a rarity in economy for any other airlines. In flight entertainment is excellent as always with lots of music and movies which distracted me from the lousy food. However, for the price I paid, I’d rather go with Thai Airways which has way better food and more consistent service. Check in staff were rude and asked me to pay 200$ to take the earlier flight to Singapore when I arrived at the check-in desk 3 hours beforehand with a 4-hour layover coming from a domestic flight."

The cabin crew seemed to be going through the platitudes of service but forgetting to actually deliver. In my case, I asked for a bottle of water instead of breakfast. Stewardess disappeared, meals were served, and expecting that someone would drop off the water after meal service, I declined the little cup that was offered to me during the meal service. That was a mistake and I just gave up so 3 hours later, I couldn't wait to get off the flight to get a bottle of water. I'm a fairly low maintenance passenger, so I'm not someone that will keep badgering the cabin crew for service. But to me this was just such a basic. Like how difficult is it to drop off a bottle of water to someone! I have a return flight booked with Singapore and to be honest Id have switched Jetstar but the flight time to work. Next time I won't pay double the price for a flight with Singapore expecting service. I might as well just use Jetstar!"

This time, unfortunately, I found the service levels to have dropped - young stewards and stewardesses dashing past repeatedly in a darkened aisle brushing people and waking them up, followed by a minor glance backwards but no apology. Apart from that, I sensed a general decline in standards - not as many smiles and rushing, the work seems more like a chore than the past when there was a sense of ""its our pleasure to help you"". Still better than many airlines but not at the level they used to be. I would add that the food (I keep a kosher diet) they served from Sydney (Lewis Continental Kitchen) was poor."

Upon checking in, we went to the lounge, very underwhelmed ; for an airline that has 4 flights per day, the food selection at 5pm was very limited and not even champagne offered. Upon boarding the aircraft seemed very tired and dated. The menu was ok because we had pre ordered Book the Cook. But if we had not we would have been very disappointed as the menu selection was very average, more like economy offerings. The seat was the widest seat I have ever been in so no complaints here. However the inflight entertainment left a lot to be desired, very old technology and not easy to use. The mattress provided was not even fitting the bed which was not lie flat and no amenity kits provided. But the service from the crew was outstanding. I feel that SQ is trading on its premium reputation from the past but needs to improve quite a bit to compete with the likes of the Middle Eastern carriers who have a much better all round product. Would not fly them again in a hurry."

They are the worst seats ever. Yes, you get lots of legroom but you lose window, there are no windows at these seats, which is not told when you go onto the site to book, sleep, the lights never fully go out because you are right by the bathroom, plus you have the bathroom light shining in your face because no one ever closes the door, and you have to listen to the nonstop clicking of the bathroom door, your legroom, because people use your space to stand and stretch their legs and this is not monitored by the flight attendants. You are in the section with the crying babies, there is an actual section for babies. There is no storage space so you have to put all of your stuff in the overhead bin, and  you have to stow your tv during takeoff and landing so there is a good hour of just sitting there while everyone else is watching tv. I can’t believe we paid $500 for these terrible seats. If I had known I would have kept the cattle seats and stretched my legs on my way to the bathroom. Personally I think you should get a discount for sitting in these seats."

The beef rendang choice I had was delicious and the wine and champagne served was truly in-flight dining at its best. The in-flight entertainment had quite a selection of current movies, so we had plenty of options to keep ourselves entertained. We were staying overnight at the Aerotel and the purser gave us some water and slippers for us to have on our journey. Although the cabin was pretty full, the cabin crew made us feel like we were on our own private jet. I'd highly recommend Singapore Airlines, based on this experience."

Air stewardesses were patient and provided great service even though I had a request nearly every hour for the first half of the 13 hour flight. I paid for an extra legroom seat and was disappointed to find that the charging points were located below the seat next to me. This is the seat that is 2nd from the exit row and next to the window. Better to sit right at the front.
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Perth,March 2019,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,2.0,1,no,1,"  I cannot believe that this flight was the exact opposite of my last flight on SIA, when I went to the Philippines to see my daughter. Absolutely dreadful. This was a typical 'red eye' flight, and I'm at least 90% sure that SIA had reduced the leg pitch on this aircraft. Granted, I am 194cms tall, and that does not help the situation at all, but still, there were a number of things that were wrong on this flight. There was a gent in front of me who decided that he wanted to recline his seat back into me to the full extent, during taxi - it was ignored by the cabin crew. And it stayed like this for the remainder of the flight to Perth. I was served a meal by cabin crew with my tray table firmly poking into my chest. Not a single word was said to this gentleman in front of me by staff. Thank God we landed in Perth on time, I felt like I had to unravel my body to get off the plane. The passenger in question was only asked to move his seat upright about ten minutes prior to landing at Perth airport. In fairness, prior to writing this, I had written an email of my concerns to the airline. I was met with a 'we don't care' kind of convoluted reply, probably from somebody who knows nothing about aircraft. I will be returning to Cebu to see my daughter at least two more times this year, but I will definitely not be flying SIA. I will revoke my KrisFlyer membership as well. I have flown budget airlines that are better than this. Buyer, beware! I would not recommend."

Upon boarding, we were informed that there was an aircraft change to a very old A330 plane without lie-flat seats. Seat was very uncomfortable, not worth a business class ticket. Plane was probably a decade old or more. Inflight entertainment is likewise outdated, not even a touchscreen. Lobster thermidor was salty, rice and asparagus were overcooked. Do not book Singapore Airlines business class, not worth it."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300ER,Family Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Shanghai,April 2019,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,2,yes,5,"  My son and I flew Business class Singapore to Shanghai in April. The Business lounge in Changi is OK, but nothing to write home about. We ordered ' book the cook' option, one chicken Brest and one Steak dish. Upon boarding we were greeted by a very cheerful crew, the flight manager already knew my name without looking at any list. The seat was incredibly wide,but quite hard in my opinion. My tail bone tells me immediately, as I was injured in a ski accident, and I can't sit in a regular economy seat more than 2 hours. I was a bit disappointed, as Aeroflot  Business seat from Moscow to Shanghai was much softer and pampering. After take off I went to the bathroom, and upon my return I found the satay dish awaiting me. I only enjoyed the chicken stick. Then no service for almost 45 min, without one cabin staff in sight .Slowly the magic and excitement were wearing off. Eventually one  showed up and asked me if I didn't like it. I said I only liked the chicken and she offered me some more, nice gesture, but I declined. There were maybe 15 passengers in Business class,that I believe can fit 50-60 passengers. Not a tough flight for the crew. Then came a green salad, very average,and then my book the cook meal showed up, which was good. As I like to drink with my main meal, and my glass was almost empty, as it Lasted me through the salad and the Satay, it was time to refresh my glass,but not such offer. I buzzed the cabin crew,and asked for another glass of drink. I kept enjoying my meal awaiting my drink that never showed up. I buzzed the crew again,and this time the flight manager showed up, I asked to have my drink if possible with my meal not with the dessert. The Coke showed up in 5 seconds. Then came the dessert, a dish with Ice cream, no choices, and a Fruit basket, the most basic desert cart I ever saw. At that point I was already regretting the huge amount of money invested in trying to experience the top notch Business class.  Then I wanted to rest,but the crew must turn your seat upside down, very weird idea,and even with the thin mattress ,it was far from a pampering bed.IF you feel like sitting down again,you have to call the F/A to flip it over to a seat..Personaly I prefer control of my lying situation, rather than calling the FA. No amenity kit distributed, but I heard that they pass by with a choice of amenities that you may find necessary for your trip -  no such basket was offered. My 14 yo son told me after the meal that he still felt hungry. I called his flight attendant  who seemed amused by my statement and said she will 'take care of him' - she brought him a small pack of nuts. So much for generosity. At Aeroflot, upon hearing that my son was still hungry (growing boy,) brought him a pasta casserole from Business class. Free WiFi to Business class was a great idea. We arrived in Shanghai wondering was that Singapore Airlines we heard so much about? We really felt disappointment. Nothing really bad, just a very very ordinary trip."

Singapore Airlines is usually my family's airline choice because of the great service, seats and special assistance (I travel with a wheelchair with a Yamaha motor and battery). Checking in going to Hong Kong and leaving took a while due to the staff being unfamiliar with the chair. The check in staff going did not not pass information to the gate agent was asked the same questions again. When we landed in Hong Kong, the wheelchair had a bit of damage but was settled by the ground staff. Upon return, we were told to wait somewhere for the wheelchair but it turned out to be at baggage reclaim. Both flights were very good despite the issues on the ground which I wouldn't blame Singapore airlines for. The cabin pressure on the A350 was minimal compared to other aircraft. If you need special assistance traveling I would recommend flying on Singapore airlines."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Perth via Singapore,January 2019,3.0,1.0,,,,1.0,3,no,1," London to Perth via Singapore. Having flown with Singapore before I was sure that they would be helpful and accomodating as we flew with our 5 month old to visit family at Christmas. We checked in the pram and car seat after paying to have them wrapped at the airport and had arranged to have a bassinet seat for the flight. This was all arranged with no problems. However, around an hour into the flight I was very aware that my baby needed to be changed. I went to queue for the toilets and there was 6 people ahead of me in the queue. My baby began to scream, I’m sure to the discomfort of the other passengers. I was very aware of this and decided to try and find another bathroom with a smaller queue. The only one with no queue and a change table was in business class. As I approached, one of the cabin staff asked where I was going. I said “sorry, my baby is screaming I just need to change her” she said “you can’t use these toilets you have to go back” I explained the queue situation but she wouldn’t budge so I had to go and queue with my child screaming and all the other passengers glaring at me. When we arrived at Perth airport we were annoyed to find that out pram was broken. Despite having it wrapped, it had been broken through the wrapping and the footrest was hanging off despite the fact we had only had it for 5 months. I checked the airline policies which stated we were covered up to a certain amount so I emailed them within 48 hours with the relevant forms, photos of damage, boarding passes and purchase receipts. They responded after a few days with a very unprofessional email basically requesting the same information I had already sent. I sent it again. Twice. They sent another badly worded email asking me to drop it off somewhere for assessment. By this point we had been back with our taped up pram for about two weeks. I responded explaining that it’s the only pram we have and we couldn’t drop it off. We had done everything they had asked. I never heard anything back. We were very disappointed and annoyed with the way we were treated both on the flight and the way our complaint was dealt with. I would never fly with Singapore airlines again which is a shame because I had flown with them twice previously (without an infant) and had a very positive experience."

It has to be said that the service provided in all four of the legs with Singapore Airlines was exceptional, from beginning to end (both on the ground and airborne); all staff where extremely professional, yet fun, friendly and accommodating to all passenger's needs. This cabin crew in particular who looked after us on the long, SQ37 flight from LAX to SIN on 14/03/2019, provided beyond exceptional service. They were actively and consistently attending passenger's requests, as well as checking that we were happy and well looked after, for what appeared to be the whole duration of the flight, or about 17+ hours. It was so satisfying and reassuring to see the dedication that this particular team had for their duties, as well as a clear love of the job. Great ambassadors for such well regarded airline such as SQ. We just simply couldn't had hoped for a more enjoyable journey.

Not Verified ,A380-800,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to London Heathrow,March 2019,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,2.0,2,yes,5,"  Singapore to London Heathrow. For my holiday to New Zealand in February / March this year I decided to upgrade my flights for all four legs of the journey to business class. Three parts of my journey were enjoyable, the service and food was good, even though I didn't receive the book the cook meals Id ordered. Sadly on the last leg from Singapore to London flight SQ322 I found myself on the A380-800. I found the business class section to be cramped, with a lack of storage space, not very well designed and for a new plane starting to show signs of wear and tear. The first problem was the width of the seat, it was a lot narrower than other seats in business class. I heard a lady behind me complaining to a stewardess about the hard seat. She replied that BMW had designed it. My thought was what is comfortable in a sports car is not so good on a 13-15 hour flight where you are sitting / lying down for nearly all the time. However with cushions it can be made more comfortable. Nothing can be done to make the seat wider and the high and very wide plastic infill between my seat and the window made me feel more cramped. I could see no useful purpose for it. The lack of storage space was a problem. I didn't want to put my carry on bag in the overhead lockers as it could be difficult / noisy to access it on a night flight. Unlike some other planes there was no small recess area where I could put my bag on the floor, but within my seating area, so the aisle was still clear. A stewardess put it on the floor but when the bed was out I couldn't access it without grovelling about on the floor. I made my bed up and tried to sleep. I placed my handbag on top of the large but fairly useless plastic infill, during the flight I think as a result of turbulence the bag fell on my head. I wasn't impressed at the time but later on I did see the funny side of it. As the seat / bed was narrow when I turned over I kept hitting my head. It was also quite difficult to get up from. I've had no such difficulties on other business class flights . The design, space and attractiveness is so much better on other Singapore Airlines business class cabins. I know the other passengers in my group flying in business on this flight were unhappy too. While I was queuing to leave the plane at the end of the flight a man of average height and regular weight said That thing is a waste of space refering to the plastic infill between the seat and the window. I had to agree. A senior stewardess told me the airline is planning to convert more of their planes to this design. Thanks for the warning. When I fly to Australia next year I will have to look for a new provider. I cant take the risk of paying for a business class fare and being placed on the A 380-800 again."

I liked the food however overheard another passenger who doesn't like spicy food said that she wished she was told that it was spicy. Had some interesting encounters with cabin crew. First, a cabin crew used his index finger to give instructions to me instead of open palm/hand. Another cabin crew, during beverage serving, gave me the remaining orange juice as if i have no choice to make. Although both were minor hiccups. One funny incident had me cheering silently for the cabin crew as one of the adult passenger (father of another young adult passenger) kept on answering from the opposite row on behalf of his son every time a cabin crew would ask his son thus making a bit of a minor noise/disturbance. Cabin crew reminded the adult passenger that his son is old enough to answer simple questions. Fierce, i liked it. That's why im raising my overall experience score to 8 because of that."

I have flown Singapore Airlines from the past 20 years regularly until now, I considered myself to be a loyal customers. They used to care about customers before; apparently, being named the best airline in the world has gone to their head and they think they no longer have to satisfy their customers. I flew Premium economy recently to Bangalore and paid for the extra legroom seat--the flight was ordinary. I was expecting an offer to upgrade to business class before my flight and I have more than 50,000 pts. No such offer came--I tried to offer a bid, the system didn't allow me to. When I saw the flight, there were plenty of seats empty in Business class. Not sure why they don't want to offer the premium economy passengers to upgrade to business. Warning to everyone travelling from SFO--some connections to India have a very short layover--less than an hour. SA doesn't have any consideration that if the landing is a few minutes late and the connecting flight is within 30 minutes, they shouldn't make the passenger run from one terminal to another even using Skytrain. I barely made it before the gate closed (with my bad knees). Remember, you have to go through security in Singapore when you have a connecting flight. I had to rush from Terminal B to C with no time even to rush to the restroom let alone freshen up.  While returning from Bangalore, I had ~4 kgs extra. Instead of asking me to pay using my Krisflyer (over 50,000) points, Singapore airlines charged me for a whole extra piece. So watch out, even if you are just 2-4 kgs over the limit in Premium economy, they will charge the cost of a suitcase. I even asked to pay for the upgrade in Bangalore, the said I can't do it in the last minute using points and I should check during my layover in Singapore (~ 2 hours). When I tried to upgrade for the longer flight SIN - SFO, they said that I don't have enough points. I offered to pay with points and cash--they said I can't do that. They just didn't want me in Business class even with points or cash! I wanted to avoid paying extra weight fees as I would have below the limit int Business class. If this is not an example of not caring for customers or accommodating its Krisflyer members, I don't know what is. Why can't they charge per Kg extra weight instead of an additional piece of luggage like other airlines?   Flight and food was ordinary (food quality has declined from SF to Singapore), and the bathroom cleanliness both ways was not up to par like it used to be. Changi airport is exceptional of course. I am not sure I will  be flying this airline again while there are so many carriers who offer upgrades for a reasonable price and cheaper tickets. Not sure what to do with the balance points (more than 50,000 points) though. Sorry Singapore airlines, you lost a loyal flyer who has flow the long route for more than 20 years.."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Tokyo,January 2019,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,10,"  Singapore to Tokyo. The flight was fully packed, but we still manage to fly on time and reach there slightly earlier than scheduled. I flew with friends and took a row of seat. We  accidentally spilled a drink, and the stewardess was  smiling as they help us clean the mess, they also keep coming back to us to check if our seats are dry, giving us extra napkins and later, extra blankets telling us to sit on it. What a pleasant experience. In flight entertainment was great, plenty of choices, and movies from all over the world. One thing though, we found the leg space to be slightly smaller than usual, not sure if it was all the winter clothing we had with us, or the seat space shrunk. We chose different meals, and tried each others', they taste great. "

During meal service SQ flight BKK- SIN and SIN-DUS I requested hot tea with lemon and coke. Flight attendant did not pay attention then gave me a salad sauce instead of coke and tea lemon. I was hocked and repeated my request for hot tea with lemon and coke. Flight attendant politely smiled and skipped my request. Dinner meal was without any dessert on international flight SIN-DUS. I was surprised there is no dessert. I asked crew  and they said no dessert and no fruits. During snack service they offered only mini potato chips and mini ice cream. There is poor meal quality on international flights and Singapore Airlines crew members were not attentive just poor attention and performed poor sloppy service.  Poor WIFI connection. Awful! Bad experience. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Los Angeles to Singapore,December 2018,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1,no,1,"  Los Angeles to Singapore. We booked a flight to SIN on Singapore Airlines in economy class from LAX for 11/2018. A few days before we departed, we received an email from them encouraging us to bid on an upgrade to economy plus. Even indicated what was a “low” bid with less chance of getting the upgrade, so we paid a higher bid that gave us a “fair” chance. Shortly before our flight we received an email that we were approved and could book our seats. We immediately went to the seat selections and found only 4 seats available, none together or even close. We called Singapore Airlines but they said there was nothing available and our prior seats in economy were now taken. We again asked at the counter when we checked in but same answer - no seats available. We are in our 70’s and had to sit rows apart on different sides of the aircraft for this very long flight. One of the seats was in the last row of economy plus and was so cramped it was very difficult to get in and out to use the restroom. We suffered. When we returned home, we found out Singapore Airlines would not even give miles for the flight since it was initially booked in economy. We requested our money back as we felt taken and deceived with the charge, lack of disclosure, and the unacceptable and poor quality service provided. They said “no”, terms and conditions protect them. Beware of Singapore Airlines offers as they may not be what you expect, especially for an airline that touts their reputation. We were extremely disappointed in their offer, service, and response! First and last time we will fly with them."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-10,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Nagoya,December 2018,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,4,yes,9,"  Flew Singapore Airlines on their Boeing 787-10 from Singapore to Nagoya. Check-in was efficient,  and at boarding the crew was very warm and friendly, greeting everyone with a smile. The aircraft was very comfortable, the seats were very well-designed and the cabin also felt very comfortable. IFE was SQ's newest product and I had no problems using it, it was very responsive and being a touchscreen, was also very convenient. The aircraft left on time and we were in the air very quickly. Cabin service was conducted very efficiently, and the crew was also very warm and sincere, typical of SQ's high standards, After the first cabin service(mostly drinks), the lights were dimmed so that the passengers could sleep(it was a red-eye flight) and the crew was very attentive to the passengers' requests, walking up and down the aisle every now and then to ensure we were comfortable. Around 2 hours before landing, breakfast was served - the only negative thing about this flight, as the food was not really good in my opinion. On landing, the crew bade goodbye to each passenger, smiling as they always did throughout the flight, Overall, it was an excellent flight, and I would definitely fly them again"
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo Haneda to Singapore,December 2018,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,4,yes,10,"  Flew Singapore Airlines on my trip back from Japan on their A350-900, and the experience was really positive. In Tokyo Haneda, check in was very efficient, despite it being a full flight (perhaps as many wanted to return home for Christmas), and boarding was very fast too, although the managing could have been better as I witnessed some passengers holding only an economy class ticket using the business class queue. Despite the inclement weather, the flight took off very quickly, and after we left Tokyo the flight was smooth throughout. Aircraft wise, the A350 had always been a comfortable aircraft, and this was no exception - the product offered was very comfortable, and the legroom was good even in economy class. The cabin crew was also very warm and friendly and attentive to every passenger. After meal service was concluded the lights were dimmed to allow the passengers to sleep, as it was a night flight. The IFE was touchscreen, just like my previous flight with SQ on their 787 and very responsive, no problems encountered. The only downside was that SQ did not implement a tail camera that can be broadcast on the IFE - a pity, considering that the A350 has the technology and other A350 users such as Cathay Pacific and Thai Airways are using them. Not an important feature, but it would have been really cool to see it. I picked the Japanese selection for my meal, and it was very good. We arrived in Singapore early and the crew was also very friendly throughout. During the flight, they even left me a personalized message on my passenger flight logbook, and it was a really touching gesture that showed how much they cared for their passengers. Overall, I would recommend SQ, although the prices might sometimes be a little higher, it is worth as you are paying for what you get, and SQ is definitely one of the best out there when it comes to cabin service, matching ANA, who are known for their exceptional cabin service."

Early morning departure from SIN at Chinese New Year, so it was a pretty full flight. Just after security check and with less than one hour to departure, we were told that there was a technical problem with the plane and we needed to switch plane (different gate). Amazingly, the entire flight was only delayed by 1 hour, which given the short notice, I feel is pretty amazing. Flight was on A330, which has the 2-4-2 configuration, and as usual, I opted for the (2) seat which I increasingly like. Seats were slightly narrower than the B777, but it just feels less cramped than the 3 seat options. Flight crew were slightly less charming than usual, but I guess the last minute change probably had something to do with this, and they still dealt very politely with some very demanding customers. Food was reasonably good (had Indonesian option), and IFE was as standard on the A330, if slightly dated. Only slight downside was the toilet, which although clean, had obviously seen better days with some wear and tear. So a good economy experience and I guess the additional cost for the flight (as opposed to the budget airline) pays off when something does wrong, as the recovery was really fast."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Family Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Amsterdam,February 2019,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4,yes,9," Service is unparalleled. Food is very good and served on proper plates with real cutlery. Wide selection of online shopping. Best thing about this flight was the sky bed. The chair unfolds into a flat bed, which gave my son and I some decent sleep. The plane leaves SG just before midnight and arrives in AMS around 6.15am - so even a 12 hour flight seems like no time is wasted. Wifi is available on board but requires payment. The complimentary allowance for business class members is only suited for text messages - runs out fast.  Overall, a very comfortable flight. Will definitely fly again."

The entertainment center/movies were superb, although some of the plug connections were older, so the voice is low.  One time, the flight was making a loud bothering noise, and we were concerned about it especially during take off. The next flight was delayed, they decided to replace the airplane. I appreciate it that they put safety before anything else. The food was satisfying. The attendants smile. They worked fast in getting what the customers need. They are always ready to answer calls. "

In flight shopping has a huge selection of quality products. Book the cook menu was impressive - lobster thermidor and my son's steak were cooked to perfection.

Nevertheless, seats are still comfortable for the short flight from Perth to Singapore."

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-10,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Denpasar,February 2019,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,4,yes,8,"  Singapore to Denpasar. Having experienced United's version of the B787, this was an opportunity to revisit the experience on SQ instead on a short 2.5 hour flight. The initial entrance into the economy cabin is certainly more welcoming than United's experience. Once seated, you notice the high-density, thin seat cushions, which give you more perceived legroom than the standard 32 in pitch would suggest. Because SQ stayed with the 3-3-3 configuration, the seat width is narrower than the comparable A330 or B777 experience, and I certainly felt this was the case, despite the very narrow armrests. Certainly the aisles are narrow, and in the aisle seat, I was constantly jostled by passengers and assorted bags during the boarding process. I also found it hard to get comfortable on the thinner seats, though this was less of an issue for a short-haul flight. The IFE was a class above United's, with a large vibrant touchscreen and the newest KrisWorld experience (minus the seat controller), so all interactions are via the screen. Meals were reasonably good if not outstanding, while service on the inbound flight to SG was warm and friendly.  I wish that cabin seat space for Economy passengers could be maintained, given that the vast majority of us travel this way."

As usual, they are famous of their top notch quality, service, and efficiency. Crews were very attentive and helpful. Upon boarding the aircraft, you could already feel their warmth hospitality. Food is good and IFE is fantastic. Cabin crew go around with drinks and snacks in the mid of flight very frequent (every 20 mins) which is hardly seen on the other major airlines. It's definitely worth it for the price I pay for. I will choose to fly with SIA again."

What can I say about this airline — always has been my favourite and always will be. Everything from check-in, boarding, IFE, meals, baggage – went smoothly. Cabin crew were as gracious as usual. Would definitely recommend. Only perk: this was somewhat an expensive ticket (but I would definitely pay the extra and fly SQ, than other airlines that fly the route), Singapore Airlines can definitely work on competitive pricing."

London to Bali via Singapore. I flew to Australia with Singapore Airlines 5 years ago and the service was out of this world, amazing. I flew last October with them to Bali and back and it seems that standards have slipped. It seems there are a lot more male stewards on board now and they seem to give worse service than the female stewardesses. Male stewards seemed disorganised, flustered and abrupt compared to the female stewardesses who were very organised and polite.  The airline needs to have standard procedures that staff follow. We had an issue with my partners meal being vegetarian nut free and Singapore Airlines were less than helpful. They served him nuts and or meat in a few of his meals, luckily he didn't eat them. When we told cabin crew that he was supposed to have been served a nut free vegetarian meal they said we never would have been promised such a thing because it didn't exist. When we showed proof of Singapore Airlines emails promising us a nut-free vegetarian meal the steward seemed disgruntled that we had proved we weren't lying about it all. A female stewardess found something my partner could eat. Pluses: Female members of staff = fab. Clean and comfy aircraft. Pretty decent snacks and entertainment. We didn't pay to be sat together and yet we still were on each leg of the journey. I'm giving it all a 7 because the journey was just about okay, it wasn't amazing like it was last time I flew with them"

Singapore to Zurich is operated by an A380. This particular A380 that I was on is 6 years old and had the old business class product. The seat is very wide - the widest Business Class seat for any airline - sufficient to squeeze 2 slim Asians into the seat. To convert to bed mode, passengers had to pull down the seat back and raise the footrest. Because the footwell is located to one side, passengers have to sleep in a diagonal fashion. I ordered the lobster thermidor from Book the Cook. It was delicious. Cabin crew were very friendly and polite and addressed passengers by family name. After supper, it was time to sleep. A flight attendant deployed the bed for me and I had an uninterrupted 7 hours of sleep before breakfast. For breakfast I chose the Nasi Briyani, an aromatic Indian dish. Even at cruising altitude, the flavours and aroma of the dish was well preserved. I highly recommend the SIA Business Class - best in its category."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Rome to Singapore,February 2019,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4,yes,10,"  Rome to Singapore. This was my first time on the A350. It was a rather empty flight from Rome to Singapore. The business class featured the new business class product where there were buttons to control the decline of the seat. However, to convert to bed mode, you will need a flight attendant to pull down the seat back from the upright position. This is the main bugbear of the Business Class seat. No amenity kit is provided on SQ business class but you can find toothbrush, shaving kit, comb, moisturiser and hand cream in the toilet. Only eye mask, socks and slippers are provided for long haul flights. On this route , I had the Milanese Osso Bucco for my lunch main course and it was delicious. Breakfast was served 90 minutes before arrival into Singapore and I had the Westerm option of sausage, mushrooms and omelette with corn flakes and fruits. As with other Singapore Airlines flights, the cabin crew were very polite, gracious and helpful and were able to anticipate passengers’ needs. Singapore Airlines Business Class is the best in the category. Wifi was available on this flight. For business class passengers, the first 30 MB is free and after that you can purchase additional MB depending on your needs up to 200MB for US$ 25. The connection speed was reasonably fast - sufficient to upload a few Facebook photos."

Service aboard the flight was excellent. On arrival in Auckland passengers had to disembark by way of mobile stairs. I have to say, while being advised to mind our step as we stepped onto the swaying stairway, due to wind gusts, I noticed there was only one staff member that was there to help with passengers, which I felt was a small let down due to the fact it was a full flight. However, the staff that was helping passengers was absolutely amazing. "

They mostly gave me Salmon for my seafood meals. They were also willing to answer to my curiosity about the laughter coming from the rear galley. Another problem encountered was the Wi-Fi because I had to pay for it. However, neither the Wi-Fi nor my Mileage Plus problems were as big as the problem encountered in 2014. I can say, quite a big improvement in service from 2016. All in all, the problems (Mileage Plus & Wi-Fi) were much smaller"

While the flight to Paris from Brisbane was relatively enjoyable, the return was not. The staff serving our aisle constantly forgot things. I was given half a meal (no diet restrictions) she just forgot to give the rest. When I realised because the woman across from me received her full meal (from the FA on the other aisle). I asked my FA for the rest. She said she would have to check if she had any left. She then proceeded to serve the rest of her side of the plane and then forgot entirely. When I pressed the service button, she came up and told me I had bumped it before even asking if I needed anything. I reminded her about the meal but she said they had all gone. I ended up with an economy meal then - no choice. My partner numerous times requested a drink and had to remind the woman 15 minutes later when nothing came. Then to top it off - For Christmas my partner purchased a new suitcase for me. So the return trip was its first time. It was a Samsonite Case and it arrived in Brisbane completely trashed. Plastic parts around the handle snapped off, dents so large it pierced the plastic the whole way through. My zip doesnt even zip up flush to the case any longer. I contacted the airline but they will not cover it. "

We boarded in sections efficiently and were warmly welcomed on board. The seats are smaller and the pitch tighter. We departed on time and as soon as airborne the teen in front of me reclined her seat the screen was a hands length away from my face. Shame that this more expensive airline has effectively negated the positives of flying with them. Yes you still get hot refresher towels and the entertainment choice was pretty good. The food was okay, nothing special but adequate if you like beef. We were seat 45, and the only option left was the beef. The toilets were kept clean and we arrived into Changi on time. However it is the tight seats at premium price I have an issue with. I am divided as to whether I’d recommend, it’s safe and reliable so I’d say yes. However do not expect anything special."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Stockholm via Moscow,February 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2,no,1,"  Singapore Airlines is a totally different airline when taking the route Singapore to Stockholm via Moscow. The air hostesses are usually very service minded in Singapore Airlines and thats why I used to like them. But the exception is this flight through Russia. The air hostesses are mainly Russian and do not meet expectations in my eyes of the usual level of service that defines this airline. Furthermore, when exiting the plane in Moscow, prepare yourself for a nightmare. 1 long line which consists of all the passengers on the A350-900, needs to line up for getting a red stamp in your boarding pass. Then you have to stand in a second long line to get a green stamp in your boarding pass. Then there was a third line to the x-ray of the hand luggage before you could stand (not enough seats to sit) by the gate without any restaurant, café or what so ever. And add to the misery that since i stupidly enough forgot my boarding pass to Moscow on the plane, I had to stand in a fourth line. Its very obvious this route is a failure. It is always way more cheap going through DME to and from Singapore than through LHR, FRA or CPH. Avoid Singapore Airlines flying to and from Stockholm through Moscow."

Online check-in process easy, I managed to call the hotline to change my seat to get an exit row with my parents which was done easily. SQ did even bother to send us an SMS to warn us about the French strikes blocking the roads and to go early to the airport subsequently. Very good point. I find the quality of service onboard below of that of few years ago, food standard and bland, staff with good hard-skills though (responsive, efficient and professional) but could be better - they talk very fast, robotic gestures and could be more smiling. On our inbound leg, they ran out of one food option which left us very disappointed. Seats on the Boeing 777-300ER larger and more comfortable compared with that of other premium airlines. For the outbound Jakarta-Singapore leg, they asked us if we wanted to take an earlier flight, so that we could have more buffer time transiting in Singapore for our next flight to Paris and not being too much in a hurry, which was a very good point. All in all, very good ground service, but experience onboard quite standard. I place this experience on par with 4-star airlines such as Emirates, but below the 5-Star Qatar Airways. Good value for money though."

On boarding the large number of passengers on this oversized aircraft was impressively quick and smooth. Flight attendants were elegantly efficient - the female flight attendants were strikingly lissome. Sitting configuration was 3-4-3. Seats were comfortable but given that most seats were occupied, the cabin felt crowded. Lots of film choices on the seatback personal entertainment system, they were easy to access. Ample overhead luggage space. Leg space a bit tight. Seat reclination juts the backseat TV screen rather close to your face and the tray table to your tummy. In fact, the flight attendants, while serving meals, ensured that the passengers returned the seats to a more straight up position. A dinner and a breakfast were served. A multi page menu book was provided to all. There were two entree choices for both meals - no vegetarian choice. That was a shocking surprise. I chose the fish dish. It was amply portioned and tasty. The breakfast cold sandwiches were dry and virtually inedible. Predinner drinks were served in plastic tumblers from a tray that flight attendants carried - juice, beer, white wine were on offer. Dinner and breakfast cutlery were metal, not plastic. Duty free catalog was thick but nothing distinctive products on offer. Cockpit crew kept us informed of the flight and take off delays. Singapore Airlines should consider their impact on the environment - on this relatively short overnight flight they can simplify the breakfast and dinner, dispense with the paper menu and the basic amenities bag and ensure a vegetarian option as standard. Bathrooms were clean throughout. A good option over Lufthansa or United. Arrived more or less on time after a somewhat bumpy flight."

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Singapore to London Heathrow,November 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,4,yes,9," Departing SIN-LHR on the redeye flight (departing 1 am), this means a group of grumpy and tired travellers. Took the front row bulkhead seat in PE on Boeing 777-300ER which gives quite a lot of legroom, the downside is the the inflight entertainment (IFE) system is tucked away on the floor, in a it's own separate housing. I eschewed the champagne and dinner for sleep, and here I still find the SQ PE seats very stiff and difficult to recline, it really takes quite a lot of effort to force the seat into a recline position. Nonetheless, there is a reasonable amount of elbow space, and the personal reading lights, noise-cancelling earphones and cubby holes give a sense of comfort. The IFE is the new touch-screen system with a separate seat controller handset. My IFE monitor refused to come out of it's housing, but the aircrew performed some magic with a knife and fork, and saved the day! Food (the breakfast that I tried) was reasonably good, and crew were proactive with drinks and snacks through the flight. The only downside of PE in the B777 series is that access to the shared toilets is at the rear with normal economy, and you have to manage the queues for access the best you can. Overall, a good experience especially now that PE pricing appears to be equivalent to the prices from competitors such as Lufthansa."

Our flight over to Vietnam was quite comfortable and good service, however, the return was quite different. My bag was severely damaged in transit from Danang to Singapore. I was given the run around at Changi by staff and have to hope that I can manage a damage claim via email. The Silk air flight (which was code shared on SQ ticket) was very average. Old plane, the meal looked awful. Service was very rushed and impersonal. Singapore to Adelaide flight overnight - no sleep due to extremely badly behaved child that screamed the whole time. Staff seemed oblivious and only intervened to talk to the parents when I requested them to do so. No food served until 5 hrs into the flight despite the fact everyone was awake due to screaming child. Drinks trolley never bought through. No snack service in galley like other flights do. Very disappointed. Food was average and service slow. I found it insulting that the IFE played a video showing all the features of the business class seat not once but twice, a lovely reminder to those in cattle class what they are missing. New A350 has poor leg room and when the person in front reclined i could not bend my legs and had to keep them straightened under the seat in front. IFE very average. Wouldn't go out of my way to fly Singapore again."
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Zurich to Singapore,November 2018,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1,no,4,"  My experience was less convincing. The reservation line was always busy and it takes ages to get through. The seat is large and comfortable to sit, but to sleep it is not comfortable at all: too hard, too narrow footrest and you sleep in a diagonal position which is awkward. I could not sleep at all during the whole flight. And the food was really bad: very tough meat, overcooked and bad taste. Worst food I had in a long time. Staff is friendly but not efficient, sometimes it takes ages to get some water or bread etc. Overall really disappointing experience. A pity as they used to be good some years ago. In any case I will not chose them again. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Zürich to Singapore,November 2018,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,1,no,4,"  I flew Singapore Airlines A380 business from Zürich to Singapore in November 2018, and it was really a disappointment. Prior to my flight, I pre-ordered cordon blue for my dinner. It was just bad. Although the business section was not full, the flight attendants kept forgetting to deliver my drinks. During dinner, they offered red or white wine, and when I asked for a diet coke, they got lost completely. When I ordered a coffee, they gave me the coffee long after I finished my dessert but never delivered the stirrer.  The business seat is extremely uncomfortable. The cushion is hard covered with a thin layer of leather cover. Even adding the bedsheet won't help. The armrests are a piece of small folding plastic, I couldn't rest my arms comfortably on them. When I reclined the seat, I was unable to stretch my legs due to design of the leg room. One has to curve his/her legs to fit the shape of the leg room and it is extremely uncomfortable to sleep like that. The quality of the image and sound of entertainment is below average. They offered limited movie selections. I am usually very easy going with airlines and I don't like to spend time to write reviews. However the newly designed business seats in Singapore airline are unacceptable.  Singapore airline should pay more attention to improve their seats, foods and services."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Copenhagen to Singapore,October 2018,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,10,"  Excellent service all the way from Stavanger, first with SAS to Copenhagen, then on to Singapore with Singapore Airlines. I choose Singapore Airlines for the entire trip from Stavanger - Singapore - Melbourne - Mildura- Melbourne - Perth then back to Stavanger via Singapore and London Heathrow mainly because they are part of the Star Alliance Group. All flights left on time and arrived earlier that scheduled. The service was excellent throughout. I particularly enjoyed the trip from Copenhagen to Singapore where I met a delightful young lady who was a member of the cabin crew. She took time to chat even though they were quite busy.  I have flown with Singapore Airlines several times before"
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-10,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Singapore,December 2018,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,3,no,5,"  Bangkok to Singapore. Among all the times I have flown with Singapore Airlines, this trip did not feel like Singapore Airlines at all. Firstly, there was a slight delay and the ground staff did not provide any information whatsoever. A bad start to the journey. After boarding the plane, I could feel that the cabin crew lacked warmth and hospitality. Shortly after takeoff, the cabin crew came round to serve the children first. They came to serve my 8 year old Sister the meal however they did not give her two choices to choose from. They just served my Sister chicken with rice. It turns out that the chicken with rice was too spicy. There were actually two choices (beef stew and chicken with rice) which left me wondering why they did not stop to ask my Sister what choice she wanted. They didn’t even tell her that the chicken with rice was spicy!  When the cabin crew came round to serve adults, they were very rushed and did not make themselves clear at all. They asked ‘stew or chicken rice?’. They didn’t bother to tell us what meat the stew was. And they also did not offer any drinks. You have to ask them yourselves. The service I experienced was far from the ‘superior quality’ Singapore Airlines used to offer. I understand the need to rush service a little as the flight was only a little over two hours. However that does not mean that they can treat passengers like that. Disappointed with Singapore Airlines this time round. The only good point of this trip was that we could fly in their new Boeing 787-10 with improved amenities. But other than that, this flight could not be recognised as from Singapore Airlines!"

Legroom was great and cabin crew were very polite as usual. The meal was delicious and it was nice of them to offer ice cream as a dessert. Inflight entertainment was also good but could have more options. Even though we were flying in one of the old A330s, this Singapore Airlines experience was amazing. Definitely would try them again."

The only problem that I had with them was my Mileage Plus, both the cabin crew on the outbound flight and the ground staff in Newark barely knew anything about it. I asked the outbound flight crew about my Mileage Plus, they told me to consult the ground crew who just said both airlines are members of Star Alliance. He wasn't even sure if Mileage Plus members flying on Singapore Airlines were able to access United lounges. However he did tell me that Mileage Plus users (me inclusive) had to upgrade to Gold before accessing a Kris Flyer lounge but that seemed to be the only thing he knew about Mileage Plus."

During the meal service, there was no one asking me to refill the drinks when crews saw my empty whisky glass, is it very expensive? Most of the crews without any anticipations for passengers. I can remember a female crew, when I asked for help to lay the bed back before landing, she asked me to carry her service tray for her, exchange? When she helped a lady seating behind me to lay the bed back, she put the blanket around the side of my seat, somehow the blanket slapped my head and I was shocked, when I was seeing her she just realized and said sorry! All the small details reflected that there is no attention for the customers, but some of the SQ flights I took before was so different! Honestly speaking, I was not comfortable this time and I feel there is no consistency for the cabin crew.  Really disappointed this time and not worth as a elite member anymore."

Upon arrival in Milan, a new group of cabin crew took over. This new team has been exceptionally outstanding in their service, beyond the normal that SQ is known for. When I asked for a cup of coffee, the steward served it with a small chocolate bar. In between meals, they served apple fruit; many minutes later, they served potato chips. These were additional foods than the normal snacks and drinks they served. The cabin crew were always visible throughout the flight, SQ377 on 28 Nov 2018. It’s like in economy class served like in business class."

I am  impressed by this amazing latest Business Class product on the super silent A380. The seat has an incredible amount of privacy, plenty of functionalities and storage options and it is wonderfully set-up. The selection of movies is extensive and it comes with a big HD touch-screen. Food was great and the service, as usual on Singapore Airlines, was phenomenal. They remain my favourite airline out there. Particularly on this route, they put their code-share partner SWISS to a big shame. Overall, an impeccable flight, from the ground to the air."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Surabaya to Singapore,December 2018,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Surabaya to Singapore. Worst airline in terms of punctuality. I am a frequent flier and i took this flight pretty often.  For a premium airline (which is like really premium because Singapore Airlines price themselves higher than other airlines flying the same route) they are offering below subpar performance. Well, taking note their “getting you there on-time” slogan. They obviously getting us there but not on-time. One of the worst airlines where it comes to reliability and accountability."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Singapore to Johannesburg,November 2018,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,,4.0,4,yes,7," Singapore to Johannesburg. Check in and formalities were super efficient as is normal at Changi. The flight is at the unsocial hour of 01.30, recently changed from 02.00. Unfortunately only the scheduled time has changed. We were 30 minutes late, and it seems that this is the norm for this flight, and an extra half hour of sitting around at the time in the morning is frustrating. Boarding when started was efficient. The premium economy cabin is relatively spacious with ample space for storage, and the seats are very comfortable. A pre-take off drink, as is the norm on other airlines premium economy would have been very welcome after the wait. After take off drinks were served. Champagne is offered, but in a tiny plastic faux wine glass, and other drinks are also served in plastic tumblers that seem to become progressively smaller. Due to the timing only a light snack is offered. Although this was quick there was a long wait for coffee or drinks top up to be offered, and tables cleared, as there are no dedicated premium economy crew. Service is the same as economy, and although Singapore Airlines economy is amongst the best it does not match the premium economy service of other airlines such as Qantas. Overall the comfort and space are excellent, but the service level is economy - on all 4 premium economy flights on this trip the curtains between the cabins were left open."
Not Verified ,A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Singapore,November 2018,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,4,yes,6,"  Sydney to Singapore. In Sydney, ground staff are particularly efficient. Aircraft was showing its age and perhaps an upgrade is required. I am unsure if it is the timing of the flight or the duration, however, the service lacked the upbeat and positive enthusiasm that SIA is known for, smiles were limited. I must commend the work of the senior flight steward who took excellent care of his passengers and came to check on them every few hours. The meals were average, not necessarily the best. They should allow passengers to know what is being served in the special meals category. Entertainment system didn’t respond either. However, the overall flight was okay, however, I have noted SIA for better service particularly on the SYD-SIN sector."

The aircraft was in a top notch condition and the food was by far the best food I have ever tasted on an airline. The cabin crew were extremely attentive and were very courteous. I should particularly mention how they look after toddlers very well on board. Load factor was full however this wasn’t a challenge for the team at all. The only drawback of an otherwise excellent flight was the fact that the entertainments system malfunctioned so much that I ultimately gave up and went to sleep.

The service that I received in Sydney Airport was so unprofessional. The ticket that I bought is student ticket, so I got 10KG more baggage allowance. However, the staff said that my baggage are overload (43kg in total). I  understand that baggages are overloaded, and I was happy to pay for the extra 3kg, so I asked the staff how much I have to pay for the extra KGs, she answer AUD270. So I chose to repack my baggage since I think it is more expensive than I expected. after I repacked (1kg extra), the staff asked if I can pay for the extra or not (I was surprised, since it is just 1kg more). Even though I understand that the ground staff are mostly outsourced, they are representing SQ, so I should expect professional service. The aircraft from SIN to HKG was very old that the screen is still is squared format. The meal tasted bad as well. I do not normally complain about the quality of the food as long as they are acceptable, however, I did not think that it is in an acceptable quality from world No. 1 airline. Thirdly, I am not sure if all airlines are like this or not, however, from the meal menu, they have 3 courses to choose, I was informed that they only have 2 courses though. The seat of A380 is alright, but not okay for the B777 since it is way too old. I did not think the staff of SQ is friendly too, you can tell that the staff of my aisle are tired of the job and did not want to serve. I had a really high expectation in SQ since it  ranked as the No1 airline, however, my experience tell me that it is not."

The plane is not very old (9 years) but had already old fashioned seats (no flat beds) and old entertainment. Both latter are the sole critical points in this experience that have been compensated by a fantastic crew with fantastic service. No airline can ever beat Singapore airlines when it comes to onborad service. A very attentive cabin crew with a very friendly and professional purser. Drinks were great and meal was fantastic that comes as usual with sate as appetizer.

Having flown long-haul with various airlines over the years, and with Singapore Airlines to Asia before, we opted to use them again as they offer good value and service. We booked direct with the airline, which was cheaper than any aggregator sites - we had intended to fly premium economy, but when booking managed to get a business class outbound journey for almost the same price. The experience was excellent - from the business class SilverKris Lounge at LHR to the onboard service. The plane we were on had the relatively new business class seats, which were superbly comfortable and afforded a truly relaxing journey, with a good range of entertainment, food and drink (we used the 'Book the Cook' to have our own choice from the extensive menu). The wifi was also reasonable even if a 30MB allowance is meagre for a near 12.5 hour flight! The overall service was attentive without being over-bearing and the staff were always smiling - our every request was met and reinforced our view that Singapore Airlines offer the best business class experience among the top airlines."

I found the food inedible, wine was a sauvignon which I don't like, I asked for Chardonnay just got a no. Toilets were dirty. We have a suit hanger when boarding to be hung and when we disembarked we saw it in the floor, when I asked why it was just dumped on the floor instead of hung up they had a no response attitude.

The seat was super wide and comfortable. Service was so attentive that sometimes I felt like I was being watched. Food was delicious and beautifully plated. One minor complain: I booked airport transfer through Singapore Airlines, and the car came early, but then the airline's check-in counter at HKG was not open until less than 2 hours before departure, leaving me wandering around the check-in area for over an hour. Despite this, I still think Singapore Airlines deserves to be the best in the world."

Water juice served constantly. Singapore set the bar for the best that economy anywhere can offer. Pity the app and website were not up to that standard. All in all 10 out of 10 for the flight.

This was my first time on Singapore Airlines and the service was outstanding and the cabin crew were superb.  The A350 is a wonderful airplane and nearly silent. That was wonderful. The food was delicious, especially given that it is airline food. The cabin was uncrowded and well laid out in business class. The lavatories were spacious, clean and well supplied. I was surprised by no amenity kits and no pajamas in business class on long flights, and the crew did not automatically offer to assist with turning the seat into a bed. The angle at which you could lay flat was on a slant  because of where your feet have to go.  The cabin music, when playing, is cloying, saccharin and unpleasant. There was free WiFi in business class but I could not get it to work on the SIN-BNE leg and no one on board could solve the problem."

Singapore Airlines is my best economy flight experiences so far. When I arrived at Hong Kong airport, I mentioned to the ground crew doing my check-in that I was concerned about any delay as I only had 3 hours of layover at London Heathrow when I had to clear customs and wait for my checked bag before I travel from terminal 2 to terminal 5 to catch the BA flight to Leeds. She called someone and then went to ask her superior when she couldn’t get answer on the phone to see if it’s possible to check my bag to Leeds. I knew they couldn’t do that when the two airlines belong to different airline partnerships (One World for BA and Star Alliance for SQ).  When I came back to Hong Kong a week later, I asked the ground crew at check-in if they might have any row of 3-seaters available,  ground crew looked to see if two rows that were blocked could be released. She then assigned the aisle seat, blocked the middle seat, and said she would do her best not to assign anyone to the window seat if possible.  I was able to lie down from London to Singapore. When they served the main meal, I told a flight attendant that I wanted Peppermint tea  and I brought my own as other airlines I have flown never had peppermint tea. He said they did. Not only did he bring me a cup, he also gave me a few bags of them for my layover at the Singapore airport. SQ has the most comfortable pillow for economy class in my experience. The blanket was twice the size and thicker than that of United. The economy passengers also got an amenitY kit (socks, toothbrush, toothpaste) . They have a foot-paddle to open the trash bin in the restrooms. When I got to Singapore, I asked at the gate if there might be a 3-seater available for the flight to Hong Kong. They assigned me to a 2-seater by the window. "

The ambiance inside the plane was spacious and great. The service was exceptional. The only things that bothered me on this particular flight was they lacked international food to serve that I was served Indian food which I’m not used to. Another hitch was the on-line check-in where I was not able to choose the seat that I wanted as it was automatically chosen so I was put in an exit row which was a hassle for me as the TV monitor and the tray table has to be set up after take off only. Thank you.

Flew from Jakarta to Singapore early in the morning. Despite some problems in overall journey, but I appreciate that they wanted to serve the best service that they can give. First, I could not use self-service check-in kios due to my single name, no gate agent was available at the moment might be because they have not started to work yet. But I didn't wait too long until they started to work. Secondly, limited choice of meal. I seated at the back of the plane therefore I became the last person to be served in the flight. Due to limited in-flight meal with chicken, left me fish which I less like it. One cabin crew apologized tried to persuade me to accept the meal, but I appreciate another cabin crew tried to find any meal options including business class."

✅ Trip Verified ,A330-343,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Hong Kong,October 2018,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Even on a smaller aircraft like this A330, seats were decently spaced out in economy and cabin crew service puts some airlines to shame.  Hainan chicken rice (one of the best tasting ones I've had) + Magnum ice cream. Even though IFE on their newer aircraft like the A350s are better, the older aircraft such as this A330 wasn't bad. Cabin crew helped to hang our jackets/garment bags, hot towels, snacks & drinks on top of the meals, metal crockery. I've had the chance to fly (economy) on their A380, B777-300ER & B777-200ER. The B772 is an older plane and it's IFE could use an upgrade, and the new retrofitted A380 tends to have slightly smaller legroom than the rest. The 773s and A350s are super comfortable. SQ is still a world class airline."

It was an amazing flight with a very charming service, with four flight attendants for us 20 people in the business class. They were always present, very friendly, every time with a smile on their face and fulfilled all wishes immediately. Everything was fine, from the champagne after entering the aircraft, to the excellent dinner with a lovely red wine until the Singapore Sling, which was served shortly before landing. Any time I would like to use this service again."

Used the airline quite a few times, they have never disappointed us. Booking was convenient as always.The ground service was good, they requested us whether we would like to voluntarily self check in, which took some time though.The seats were comfortable as usual. Entertainment was good. Food and beverages were excellent, I really like their cocktail, Singapore sling. Cabin staff were good."

Older plane but comfortable seats with decent recline and leg room, although probably assisted by my companion and I sharing 3 seats. My vegan meal was a nicely crumbed eggplant with tomato and string beans. My companion had a decent beef rendang meal. Both were tasty but too salty. Entertainment variety was good. KrisShop had a very good range of products too. Service was fantastic. This is my favorite airline."

Singapore to Frankfurt. I was a frequent flyer with Singapore Airlines. I was redeeming my miles and booked my ticket through SIA  directly. I received E-Ticket confirmation. But, when I reached airport with my family, they told me my child ticket (3 month) had not been issued. They didn't knew why. They ask me to pay a full price one way ticket at $800, instead of the $102 it was supposed to cost. I sent a letter after the trip and ask explanation and reimbursement. They replied after 1.5 month. They said they made a mistake with the code share partner and apologised, but they didn't reimburse the difference between what I was suppose to pay and what I paid without having any choice at the airport. In short they made a mistake but don't take responsibility. I have stopped using this airline. In addition we were not even together on the first row with bassinet despite there were available seats."

Going to Manila the plane was a let down. The tv was not working properly, I nearly lost my temper because I had to call the staff 3 times to fix it. In fairness, she had been very accommodating, just you have to wait a while. However, the airline going back to UK was very good. I noticed, and this is not just for Singapore Airlines, all flights that I had been in, going to Manila are the low quality/substandard/old planes, whereas, going back to the UK are the excellent ones."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Hong Kong,September 2018,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  Could not fault the airline until they cancelled a flight from Singapore to Hong Kong on 16th September 2018. This was due to a pending typhoon affecting Hong Kong. No refund is forthcoming. A small discount was offered on another flight at a future time. This is not possible for us. The pre booked hotel in Hong Kong is reimbursing us the full amount less a small administration fee. If they can do this why can't a large airline do the same.

Bearing in mind it was a 13 hour flight it never felt like that at all. The staff were great and the food and entertainment were really good. In between the meals the staff would come round with drinks and get you what ever snack you want. The inflight entertainment was amazing so much choice. Economy never felt so good.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Singapore,August 2018,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3,no,5,"  On a recent flight from Perth to Singapore, I was asked by the cabin staff whether I preferred beef rendang or western-style chicken for dinner. I asked for beef and was told that the beef sets on her trolley had run out, and I would have to wait. I was expecting her to get me the beef set from another trolley when, just seconds later, the stewardess abruptly placed a chicken set on my tray. She opened the foil to show me the contents and said that the chicken “looks good too”. Without further explanations, she went on to serve the others.  I was bewildered by her unprofessional and amateurish attitude. Not wanting to create a fuss and feeling tired, I just accepted what was given. This incident might seem trivial, but such small things do make an impression and affect my decision to fly with the national carrier again. The crew members just seemed to be rushing to get their jobs done, and the warmth of the Singapore Girl that is so widely advertised simply could not be felt. Apart from personal grooming and the technical aspects of their duties, I wonder if soft skills and proper service attitude are sufficiently emphasized during their training. "

Flight departed on time and we get good choice of food containing Fish and rice onboard with another drinks served, they are all delicious. However the entertainment was below the standard of Emirates. The staff we’re good onboard. Overall, still a great flight with Singapore Airlines."

We declined to take the change of flight and later we were informed there was delay for one hour to our flight. Why did SIA charge for additional fee knowing that there was a flight delay and make their customers to wait for 4 hours."

They rescheduled the connected flight in which made my second flight 1 day earlier than my first flight (both are Singapore Airlines). I asked for cancellation of the whole trip. They delayed the refund for almost a month even I called four times. With only refund of the flight, they still keep those I paid for the seats and said it's non-refundable. I understand if it's my personal reason to cancel the flight, I wouldn't have asked for the refund of the tickets, not to mention the seats. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A380-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to London,September 2018,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,4,yes,8,"  Midnight flight departing Singapore to London on A380 in economy class, not the favourite way to start a trip. Boarding was efficient and uncomplicated, although the sheer size of the A380 makes for a busy boarding process. We found ourselves on one of SQ's newest A380-800 aircraft, decked out in the new economy class setting with updated seating and AVOD. This configuration has economy and premium economy on the lower deck, and the very premium seats on the upper deck. We were in the 2nd most front row of economy, near to the galley. Seats were relatively comfortable (by Economy standards), with a new styled headrest. The AVOD was presented with a large touch screen, and is now line with the likes of Emirates. Food choices were pretty good (mostly edible), and service was pleasant, if not enthusiastic. We departed and arrived on time, and it was as tolerable as long-haul economy can be, I believe."
Not Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Johannesburg to Singapore,August 2018,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,5.0,3,yes,7,"  We have previously flown Singapore Airlines in economy, and have always been impressed with the service. This trip was our first experience of Singapore Airlines premium economy. Priority check-in and boarding was quick and easy, with a friendly welcome and offer of assistance from the crew. The premium economy cabin is just three rows in a 2-4-2 configuration, and there is plenty of locker space. The seats are comfortable with a good level of recline and good leg room. There is a calf support, but this serves little purpose, plus a leg rest from the seat in front. Their is a 13inch HD entertainment screen with excellent sound reducing earphones. Having experienced Singapore Airlines excellent economy class service levels, expectations of an even better premium experience are unfortunately not met. Service is economy level. There are no pre- take off drinks, and although champagne is offered when drinks are served after take off, it is in a tiny plastic faux wine glass. Wine is of mediocre quality served in a plastic tumbler. Top ups are a long time in coming as there are no dedicated premium economy crew, and the same staff serve the economy cabin. Meals were the same as economy with extras such as tablecloths absent. The main reason for traveling premium economy is space and comfort, and we had a very comfortable flight and slept well. However we were left with the feeling that Singapore Airlines somewhat belatedly introduced premium economy to keep up with their competitors, but have not totally embraced the concept."
Not Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Singapore to Brisbane,September 2018,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,,5.0,3,yes,6,"  Singapore to Brisbane. We have flown this route several times previously flying economy, before the introduction of the A350, so were looking forward to the daylight flight on premium economy. Check in and boarding could not be criticized, effortless and quick, with smiling welcoming staff. The premium economy cabin is very pleasant, with lots of locker space, and the seats are comfortable, with good recline and ample leg room. For a daylight flight the entertainment system is paramount, and this is top notch with a 13 inch hadscreen, superb noise cancelling headphones, and a vast selection of programmers. However when it comes to service, standards drop to economy level. No pre-take off drink, nor after take off drinks. A 1 hour wait until meal service, when drinks are served with the meal. Champagne is available, but wines are mediocre and served in plastic tumblers. The last time we flew this route in economy there was at least a proper glass on the tray, but now it is all plastic. Meals were brunch and then a hot snack later, with a choice of two dishes on each occasion, but out of both meals only the ice cream was good. During the flight the crew were very active, with frequent drink runs, and washrooms were well maintained. Overall a very comfortable flight, with an excellent crew, but a level of service not up to expectations for premium economy."

Always friendly, polite and smiling. Hot towels, frequent, drink runs, good food. Extra snacks and drinks available throughout the flight. I liked the drinks holder in seat backs. Seat comfortable. Blanket and pillow. The head support ""wings"" really help. Plenty of entertainment choices and reasonable screen size and quality. I didn't try the wifi. Toilets cleaned regularly during both flights. Baggage transit between flights went smoothly. Both flights were full and for the price, this is about as good as it is reasonable to expect an economy flight to be. I wouldn't hesitate to fly with Singapore Air again. And the bonus. If you are going to have some hours between flights, transiting in Changi is the best place to do it. Plenty to do, or easy to get a rest in the airport. Lots of quality food options at excellent prices."

New cabin I can t believe SQ spent so much in ""upgrading"" the business class seat which on 777-300 is way more elegant and comfortable. Still same awkward angle and I have never experienced such hard seats. Claustrophobic, narrow, hard and squeezing more seats. Will avoid as much as possible flying on the A380."

Service was great, they keep on feeding you, the food was awesome. Its was a 16hr flight but I never felt tired or stress, the seats are great.

The aircraft I flew from Shanghai - Singapore was an older A380. The seat was smaller than expected and I was uncomfortable. However the crew was very friendly and spoke many different languages. The food was not very good as compared to my Singapore to Shanghai leg, but it was definitely edible. IFE was ok, not the fastest IFE I've seen but it was sufficient. This flight was slightly below standard but it was fine. I would fly them again."

Auckland to London via Singapore. When boarding the SIA A380 in Singapore I was saddened to see how tired the aircraft was looking on the outside and the inside compared to the Air New Zealand 787 I arrived on. The seats have definitely seen better days and struggling to get comfortable half way through the flight. Sat at the front of economy you could see how much better and new the premium economy seats and screens was compared to the aged economy seat, like two different airlines on the same aircraft. Crew like always had a smile on and did plenty of laps around offering water and cleaning. Toilets was also nice and clean and stocked with basic essentials, tooth brush, combs, moisturiser along with having hot towels before each meal helped you feel a bit more refreshed. Meals was ok, drink portions are terrible. Two sips and the lots gone. Feels like cost cutting is taking place."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Business,Economy Class,Singapore to Seoul,August 2018,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,4.0,4,yes,9,"  Singapore to Seoul. Service seems to have improved since the last time I flew them on economy in December 2016. Hot towels and lots of drink refills even when flying over moderate turbulence. During the outbound flight, my inflight entertainment had no sound after an hour airborne and the crew initially wanted me to move to another seat at the rear of the plane but I rejected it as I had specifically chosen a seat on the wing for comfort. The leading crew and cabin manager eventually moved me to the first row of economy class on an aisle seat with extra legroom, insisting that I should enjoy my movie and sitcoms and also meant first to deplane! Service standards vary- local Singapore hires seem passionate and genuine but their overseas hires didn’t appear friendly. Inbound, the meal service did not start until 1.5 hours prior to landing as it was a redeye back to Singapore but the attendant serving my row was happy to heat up pot noodles for me. Chief steward was friendly and gave me a bag of free goodies having seen me carry two stuffed bears to ease my fear of it being extremely bumpy having read that the return flight would be going over a typhoon. Food option ran out but the crew let me have a vegetarian meal which tasted pretty good. Seat had issues reclining and two attendants pleasantly helped me make sure it worked despite taking 15 minutes or so. Both ways: inflight entertainment with plenty of movies and music to choose from. Would have flown them to LHR and back this winter if not for outrageously expensive winter fares exceeding 30 day stays!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dhaka to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore,December 2017,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10," Dhaka to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. I flew Singapore Airlines with my spouse from Dhaka to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. We had booked the tickets around 3 months ahead which allowed us to get them at unimaginably cheap price. So given the overall quality of service we received was great bang for buck. We loved the interior which had nice Christmas decorations. The legroom was sufficient for an economy seat. The food on the menu was better than what I have had on most flights. The cabin crew were extremely polite and helpful. Our takeoff was slightly delayed due to issues with airport and I was afraid we will miss the connecting flight from Singapore. However, we were allowed to board the flight at Singapore even though we were 5 minutes late and the last passengers in! So they were basically waiting for us. I was very satisfied with the experience and I would love to fly again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Taipei to Singapore,July 2018,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,4.0,2,no,3,"  Taipei to Singapore. Very unpleasant experience with boarding. They asked to check my boarding pass twice within one minute: the 1st time at the boarding gate, and then at the airplane entrance door. I understood that they did it that way due to their ""rigid security policy"", but did not train their staff to do it in a professional manner. "

I had not flown Singapore Airlines for a long, long time and was looking forward to this 13 hr experience. They did not disappoint and had improved over the years. Check-in and boarding were painless and in particular, boarding was well organised. Inside there were the usual charming hostesses in traditional dress. The aircraft was clean and neat. The leg room was fine considering the distance involved, In-flight entertainment was so so good that I chucked away my Sudoku puzzle book and watched what was on offer. Meals were very good and the staff made sure that we were hydrated. There were no real queues for the toilets. Before I realised it we were descending to Singapore. Great experience with the best airline in the world!"

Had ""book the cook"" US beef and it was really amazing, I could not agree more as it was the best beef I had before. Specially thanks to a lovely air stewardess, her service was really on top. Cabin was spacious. Its a perfect option so far."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Yangon to Singapore,August 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4,yes,9,"  Flying from Yangon to Singapore on mid morning flight, really showed that SilkAir struggles to match the SIA product. To be fair, we were accommodated on an Airbus A330-300, which has seatback IFE, wider seats and a generally more spacious ambience. Nonetheless, the in-flight meal for the 3 hour flight was just much better than the SilkAir product, and the IFE at least made the time pass faster. The A330 has a 2-4-2 configuration, which makes travelling as a couple or single slightly more enjoyable. The cabin crew were very engaged, going the extra mile for multiple drink servings."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Business,Economy Class,Jakarta to Singapore,August 2018,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Jakarta to Singapore. I now come back to fly with Singapore Airlines because they are named the “best airline” of 2018, but the service is the best for sure. The check in to boarding was great as usual. Onboard with a wonderful helping staff and crew.  The IFE itself was limited compared to Emirates because it’s an old airplane with no power plug and smaller screens. The food was beef and rice which was delicious. Overall, short flight with Singapore Airlines means the best one ever had. What can I say is to say Thank you to all Singapore Airlines team for this amazing short flight."

Singapore Airlines again demonstrated why it is the best airline. The flawless crew was always offering food and drinks during the whole flight, and always ready to do anything to make your flight great. The food is the best I've ever had on a flight, the IFE was just brilliant and the overall quality of the aircraft was perfect. Legroom and recline angle were exceptional. Simple details as the hot towel after takeoff and before landing make this airline special. Skytrax 5 stars well earned."

Check-In was acceptable at best, not very efficient. Although I ordered a wheel chair long ahead of time, i had to wait 20 min for it to arrive. LH has a special check-in area for handicapped people. I had pre-ordered a special meal, which was very good. It came as soon as lunch was served. Which is kind of interesting because, I like booking the SIA flight because they leave Frankfurt at 8:30 in the morning and arrive at JFK around 11, long before anybody else from Europe arrives, which is important in Terminal 4. So lunch was served at 10 am German Time. Why dont they give us a breakfast 9:15 and 2,5 hours before landing a lunch, which would make more sense. The flight was pretty packed, very classy not so many babies around. This A380-800 was built for Asians, but still it was comfortable enough because I am 6 feet 11. The IFE was pretty good, though the tv series were kind of old, movies were a year old but still acceptable. The Team was nice, but not as nice as i have seen them before. Leaving the plane I had to wait until everybody else was gone, but the wheelchair was waiting for me when left the plane. By the time i was through Immigration my luggage was already out."
✅ Trip Verified ,A380-800,Business,Economy Class,Singapore to Sydney,July 2018,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,,5.0,3,yes,6,"  The early evening flight was a new A380. Food wasn't anything exceptional though but I should mention that Singapore airlines does go through excessive lengths even in economy class, for instance providing menus. The biggest let down was the breakfast with a cold muffin and some fruits which isn't what I expected on a flagship route because I have eaten better meals on short haul flights with SQ. Crew were varying. The ones that greeted us at the entrance were extremely pleasant but the ones in the rear economy class section were very serious and I saw barely any smiling. Still got the job done though. Inflight entertainment is out of this world and is extremely sophisticated and can keep you entertained for the full 8 hours."

Three people family was forced to sit at three different seat including my minor child, Same meal was repeated.  We were given last seat in the return journey. There was no cabin space given for our seat and hence we had to put our stuff scattered in the plane. Meals were also mediocre quality with no fruits and veggies or salad."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Denpasar to Los Angeles via Singapore and Seoul,July 2018,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,5.0,2,no,3,"  My recent experience in business class was very subpar. First off, the seats were angled weird and made it difficult to sleep comfortably. The entertainment remote was also not very responsive. There were way too many announcements causing frequent interruptions in watching movies (and don't tell me they are necessary as I've never experienced so many announcements on any other airlines). I booked the cook for all my flight meals when it was available. On none of the flights were any of the flight attendants aware that I had pre-ordered my meals. They always asked me what I wanted to order and I had to remind them that I had booked the cook.  On my last leg back home (Seoul to LAX), same problem occurred, but this time they forgot to serve me breakfast (despite being awoken almost 4 hours before landing). They served me the preliminary stuff but then I sat for another hour with no meal served. I went up to one of the flight attendants, and she notified me that she accidentally gave my pre-ordered meal to someone else. However, 10 minutes later, she came out with my correct meal, which tells me she simply just forgot to serve me. The head flight attendant was apologetic and offered me a 100 Singapore Dollar voucher to use on in flight shopping. He told me it was good for one year, but I have no idea if I am going to take another Singapore Airlines flight within the next year, and especially not after this poor experience. This was such a disappointing experience. "

The flight was 20 minutes late but flying time made up for the delay and got us in early. Similarly, the 777 was very well maintained and the entertainment was remarkable. Dinner was not up to it's expected standard however the refreshment that was provided prior to landing was excellent and sufficient. The cabin staff did an excellent job and I particularly observed how they take very good care of toddlers."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Bali,June 2018,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,3,no,5," Singapore to Bali. Singapore Airlines was disappointing. What happened to the ""Singapore Girl""? Outdated IFE, still using the remote control, poor screen quality and sound. No menu given before the meals nor aperitif proposed. Straight to the food, which was bland. There is wine on the cart but it is not proposed to passengers, one needs to ask for it. A lot of useless announcements from the attendants made this flight totally forgettable. They should shorten their flight safety announcement which, I believe, is one of the longest among carriers."
✅ Trip Verified ,A380 / A330,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Hong Kong,June 2018,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,,3.0,5,yes,7," SQ856 From Singapore to Hong Kong on the A380 with a flight delay for an hour due to airspace. Flight attendant did not serve Singapore Sling during the delay as not in the air. First time I heard this explanation. When I asked for coffee, the attendant retorted at me as there is turbulence. Flight attendant very impatient. For the flight back via SQ871 on the A330 very friendly flight attendant and pilot who welcome the whole passenger and enjoy his job. I enjoy the A330 services on the way back."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to London,May 2018,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3,yes,8,  Very impressed with the overall journey with Singapore Airlines. The seating was very comfortable and easy to relax in. The cabin staff were very friendly and helpful. The service in the air was very good and professional. The menu (food and drinks) was good with a great selection for both. We were expecting a small travellers bag (toiletry) with tooth brush and other accessories for the long night trip (like other airlines do) but was not supplied. Only in the toilets we found some items. For the price of a business class ticket or any flight tickets they should have been supplied for the long trip.

I had an enjoyable experience with Silkair and later on with Singapore Airlines. The 1st leg of the flight was good. Boarding was on time as the departure was. After boarding newspapers were offered, but I refused to get one. After takeoff, the crew took a while to start with the service, but the meal was very tasty and the quantity was good. The legroom on the flight was superb due I was seated at the emergency exit. Unfortunately the IFE was only on overhead screens, so it was quite boring flight. After the layover in Singapore, the ground handling for the 2nd leg was very good and boarding commenced with only slight delay. The service on this flight began shortly after takeoff, but it was a bit rushed during late dinner was served, and I didn't get the dessert. But since it was an ample and tasty dinner, I didn't mind at all since it was already 2am as well. The selection on IFE was superb, but the flight information is a bit outdated, since it was a non-refurbished aircraft. After I called FA for a mid-term snack an ample snack was served. Shortly before arrival a very tasty breakfast was served less rushed than the dinner. Overall the FA's did a great job! The legroom on the 2nd leg was a lot more narrow, but still it was a good legroom. Landing in Zurich was on time. I had a very good experience with Silkair and Singapore airlines and I will recommend to fly with SIA!"

The aircraft was clean and the seats were noticeably narrower than the PE seat on the Singapore A380. Again I was disappointed by the minimal service by the cabin crew. I had looked forward to my flights on Singapore Airlines and found them to be lacking in attention to their passengers. I would fly Singapore again, but I would not go out of my way to do so as I did this time. I doubt that I would spend the extra money to move up to Premium Economy."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Premium Economy,Melbourne to Delhi via Singapore,October 2017,1.0,1.0,,,,2.0,1,no,1,"  Melbourne to Delhi via Singapore. Flying Premium Economy was disappointing, over rated seating and food was average and similar to Economy - apart from slight extra leg room, it was not premium at all. Service was below average. Transit in Singapore was also disappointing as agreed requests to ground staff were not actioned on aircraft. After a long time, am using my KrisFlyer points for my wife to travel Business Class from Melbourne to Rome via Singapore on in August 2018 whilst I am travelling on a Business Class ticket. My wife’s SIN-ROME booking using KrisFlyer points remains waitlisted on Business Saver Class despite 3 months of booking. Instead, Singapore Airlines wishes me to pay approx AUD$1,500 to upgrade my wife’s Business Saver Class to the next sub-class. This is unacceptable and disappointing.  Despite being a loyal customer for over 30 years, a fair significant of which is as a PPS member until recently, the airline is unable to assist. Based on poor treatment to-date in respect of item 3 above, it appears that Singapore Airlines is misleading with its KrisFlyer program in that passengers are encouraged to join up but the ability to redeem points is difficult/a very long wait.

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Perth,June 2018,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,5.0,3,yes,8,"  Singapore to Perth. This was the first time I used economy class after many years as I used business class for my business flights. I am a big fan of Singapore Airlines and a Solitaire PPS member with them, therefore it was an interesting experience to fly in economy again. Check in was fantastic as I was able to use the first class check in in Singapore which is a pleasant experience. Silver Kris first class lounge is in need of renovation as it is not in line with today’s standards of premium first class lounges. Boarding was on time and effortless, again as due to my status I was able to board first. Seating, the aircraft was an old 777-200 and the seating and equipment reflected this. Perhaps I was spoiled by flying business class but I found the seating very tight and cramped. The inflight entertainment was also very old and limited. I am aware that SIA is introducing the new B787 for the SIN to PER route, this change is well overdue. Another item is the the inflight duty free shipping, we have tried on 4 different flights to buy a certain perfume which is listed in their catalog but it was not available as well as other male colognes listed. There is no point of having a catalog on the plane when the items are not available. Cabin staff were doing a great job and well trained."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Singapore,May 2018,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Bangkok to Singapore return. Singapore Airlines is very dependable and the standards always high as is expected of a 5-star airline. The check-in counters are almost always free or have no more than one other guest in front of you. This is something I never take for granted and often a welcomed relief especially if I have travelled quite far to get to the airport. Knowing that check-ins can be done in under 5 mins from reaching the airport is an experience I've always looked forward to when flying with SQ, no matter which country I am in. The check-in staff are always pleasant and polite which sets the tone for the rest of the journey. The welcoming experience is often replicated at boarding when a senior cabin crew checks my boarding pass and welcomes me on board. SQ sets itself apart from the rest of the airlines by showcasing their best and possibly their most senior crew at the boarding area. The inflight entertainment offers an excellent selection of movies and shorter programmes. More importantly, Singapore Airlines allows passengers to use the inflight entertainment as soon as they are seated. The seat is slightly uncomfortable on the A330 in a full upright position but is fine once it can be reclined, even just slightly. They no longer places blankets in every seat for this route but they are available on request."

Early departure  from MEL and very efficient service. The A350 business class seat and fit-out is very modern and high quality. The A380 and B777 is a bit older but still good. Lie down bed takes a bit of getting used to for set-up and pack away, but once you've got the hang of it, it's great. Helps you to sleep much more than when sitting. Meals were very nice and enjoyed book the cook options. The flight attendants felt the need to wake me for meals, even when I had put the Do Not Disturb button on. Perhaps they could say at the start of the flight when meals are expected, or allow you to choose a time within a certain range? The IFE was excellent with a good choice of recent and older movies. I found the headsets pushed into my ears, which got a bit sore after a couple of hours. I wear glasses, so that might be the reason. Amenities were available in the bathroom, although I didn't realise this until the second leg. Perhaps they should announce it or tell you upon boarding, rather than leaving you to wait for a kit? Overall, very pleasant flights despite the length. On MEL-SIN-LHR, the flight arrived at Terminal 3 and departed Terminal 1, which was a bit disappointing for the national carrier's airport. I had gone to the lounge before realising my connecting flight was in a different terminal."

I was travelling with my father in law and he was travelling outside India for the first time. I had requested for wheel chair assistance, but was hesitant about the extent of assistance provided and feasible. I was so pleasantly surprised to see that all my worries  were reduced to nothing with the extent of co-operation, understanding and courteousness displayed by the staff. Hereon, I will be suggesting Singapore Airlines to everybody who asks me. A big thank you to the flight crew and ground staff for SQ 423 and SQ211 on 18th and 19th of May. Keep up the good work guys."

I am an United Gold customer. Before I booked my flight, I called Singapore Airlines to verify whether I can use the airport lounge due to my United Gold status. The staff gave me wrong info and as a result, I paid $100 more to book Singapore Airlines. However, at the airport, I was refused and was told that the staff gave me wrong info. They refused to correct their mistakes and give me refund.  This is ridiculous! The service was not any better than United and I don't even get the choice of meal that I want because they didn't prepare enough (only 25% of the meal is fish)."

My trip was quite disappointing, the 777 aircraft are so old! The TV screen resolution is horrible. Entertainment options not the newest. The flight was delayed by almost 2 hours because of push back issues.  Service and food was just okay; nothing memorable.  With the high prices they charge, I don't think it's worth it, but I still love the brand."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-10,Business,Business Class,Bangkok to Singapore,April 2018,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,9,"  Bangkok to Singapore. Wanted to try the regional business class available on the brand new Boeing 787-10. Feeling like a cocoon, it is very private, entertainment system is really great, enough space to store your book or headphones, seat is comfortable, without the Z on bed position which i think is a real improvement However, the only small negative point is that the seat is a bit narrow with small arms rest during take off and landing, you can push it down during the flight so not a real issue. Aircraft is great even if i was expected a more quiet environment, compared with the A350 for example. I didn't mention the service and the food which were amazing. Overall a great way to fly."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Perth,April 2018,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,9," Singapore to Perth. Departed from Changi airport Terminal 3. Check in was via self serve terminals - very easy. Followed by bag drop, due to a longish queue was redirected to another baggage drop area. Ground staff were eager to assist passengers. Check-in complete a quick process through security and immigration and into a shoppers paradise. Plenty to shop for and places to grab a coffee and a bite to eat. Boarding was orderly and quick again with lots of smiles and “welcome aboard”. Earphones were picked up as we boarded pillows and blankets already on the seats. Service commenced with a hot towel service followed by a bar service. I was drinking apple juice with ice. Shortly after the meal service commenced. The flight attendant noticed my empty glass an asked if I would like another apple juice with ice but she didn’t have ice on the meal trolley would I mind waiting a couple of minutes. I didn’t mind at all. And sure enough within a couple of minutes another flight attendant brought my drink - impressive and unexpected in economy class. The meal was hot and tasty and quite substantial. The seat, although not quite as comfortable as the A330 on the outbound flight, was fine and had good recline. After the meal trays were collected we were offered ice creams. On at least two more occasions my drink was replenished without asking even while I napped. Again a comfortable flight with excellent service. Singapore Airlines has always been the bench mark for service and they are working hard to maintain the high standard they have set."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Singapore,April 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,8," Perth to Singapore. It has been a long time since I last flew SQ, I am pleased to say nothing has changed they are still the same high standard they were. Check in at Perth was fast. Boarding was by zones and very orderly and efficient, lots of happy smiles and “welcome aboard” from the cabin crew stationed throughout the aircraft. The aircraft was showing its age but was very clean and the seats were very comfortable, ample leg room (I am 6ft) and good recline. Seats were already prepared with blankets, pillows and headphones. Safety checks carried out a number of times prior to and during taxi. Shortly after take-off service commenced with hot towels followed by a very good breakfast. During this 5 hour flight the crew passed through the cabin at least 4 times with trays of water and juice. Inflight entertainment was excellent with plenty to watch and listen to.The only criticism of this flight was the cabin temperature, freezing, the blanket proved essential. That said all in all a very comfortable flight with great service."
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Singapore,April 2018,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,1.0,2,yes,7,"  It's a nice experience to take Singapore Airline A380 from Hong Kong to Singapore.

Check-in at both Suvarnabhumi and Changi was organized and the staff were courteous and professional. Boarding was organized by row number, with clear announcements made for each boarding group. The highlight for both flights was the cabin itself. The seat in Economy, although in the 3-3-3 configuration on the 787, was very spacious, with generous leg room and seat storage. All seat amenities, including a charging port, light switch, and crew call sign, were available on the seat back. The IFE screen was crisp and the system itself had so much quality content, including the newest movies. The system did lag slightly when exiting the navigation map. Catering and cabin crew service was consistent with that of other Asia's legacy carrier's standards. Service could have been a bit more personal, but with 301 seats in Economy for a 1.40hrs flight, the crew did an amazing job. Overall, a very pleasant trip and I look forward to flying with them whenever I can!"

Very good flight but the seat got a little uncomfortable towards the end. Good legroom as I am a tall man and had around 3 inches to spare. Was able to have my legs straight when I wanted which makes a difference. I flew with Etihad from Auckland to Manchester and my knees rubbed the seat in front all the way. Singapore Airlines were great.

This route not too perfect like long haul flight that operated by SQ. It’s full of people, but it’s not affected to the service. I suggest SQ to change the new aircraft for this route, since so many traveler from BKK airport. Food for this flight is better than flight embarked from SIN."

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-200er,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Singapore,April 2018,2.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,4,yes,8,"  Bangkok to Singapore. Outgoing flight is quite ordinary. Head of the flight does not really possesses usual SQ pleasant personality. I was not addressed by name nor was shown to my seat. Menu was downgraded to one small thin piece of paper similar to economy class menu and wine/ cocktail choices are not listed. The retrofitted 777-200er business class seat is not comfortable at all. It give passenger good privacy, but for a short flight which does not require bed, I cannot find comfortable lounging position at all. Toilet are well stocked and very well taken care of. The return flight is better, same flimsy menu paper, same aircraft and same seat, but crews are pleasant and proactive. My lobster from “Book the cook” menu is very nice."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Taipei,April 2018,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4,yes,8,"  Flew return from Singapore to Taipei. Flights were a very reasonable hour; early morning departing and early afternoon returning. The flight out was probably only 65% occupied, which contributed to the overall sense of wellbeing. Flight was on the A330 series, with 2-4-2 configuration. If travelling as a couple or pair, taking the window/aisle seats definitely gives you a sense of your own space, so this was a big plus. Legroom was reasonable. Service was up to the usual standards, although the most senior crew were sometimes a bit unsmiling. Food was average to good, depending on your choice, and the AVOD although not spanking new, was sufficient to entertain most for this 4 hour flight. The airplane is probably beginning to show it's age - it was a bit creaky and rattly on takeoff and landing, but everything is well maintained and perfectly comfortable. Singapore Air may transition some flights to the Boeing 787, and many suggest the 3-3-3 economy seating is a nightmare for economy travellers."

A350 on the way there, 777-300ER on the way back to Singapore. Latest business class product on both segments. Seat is large and very good – plenty of privacy, storage options and reading lights. There is only one con: space for legs/feet is very limited when seat is fully down, which is kind of annoying. Mattress is also not the softest. Blanket and pillows provided are of very high quality. No amenity kit provided. Personal TV has a big high-resolution screen with a broad selection of movies and channels to keep you busy. Service was really good, proactive and with a smile – that’s where Singapore Airlines shines the most in my opinion. Room for improvement is the food. Meals selection is quite good (including the Book the Cook option) but the meal quality is inferior to other airlines in Business (see Turkish Airlines or Qatar). Good champagne and extensive selection of beverages available upon request. Note of merit for the chamomile served along with pastries & chocolates selection. First flight on-time. Return flight delayed of 40 minutes due to the delayed incoming aircraft on the Los Angeles – Tokyo Narita segment. Overall, would recommend the product and will fly again."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 773,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Phuket via Singapore,February 2018,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,2,no,2," As Bi-annual visitors to Thailand, by recommendation, we went with SQ for a change having heard great things about Changi airport. This time we took our adult daughter too - 'the shopper'. Unfortunately, all we saw of Changi was what we saw while running through the terminal, owing to our first connecting flight being delayed, then our second going tek and requiring us to change aircraft many hours later than our departure time. We were handed forms at the departure gate and an invitation to contact Singapore Airlines for future incentives. Infact, what we got in reply, months later, was in short: 'Safety first; we don't compensate for delays or connections - if missed' (all our flights were SQ). Tough luck. Therefore our experience of SQ is one we wouldn't recommend and as they state, they wash their hands of you if you miss a connection even in the event that connecting flights are both SQ. As a former employee of a British airline operating the very same aircraft I feel I have enough experience to say this is at best a poor outcome from SQ. On a positive note, they make it easy to decide who not to spend your time airborne with. Also, my wife is gluten free, although requested, she had to skip some meals because they didn't have the gf option for her."

Service remains 5-star, food, onboard service and entertainment, boarding. Have flown several times on this airline in the past in economy class. Boarding on both flights were swift and smooth with clear instructions from airline staff. Choice of food adequate with sandwiches/refreshment available outside of main meal distribution. On the return leg, the breakfast offering was adequate but not available due to short supply on board. I was forced to take noodles as breakfast while preference was for other dish. Boeing 777 seats are of good quality, only drawback is that seat cushion is quite short for a tall person with long legs and the screen is slightly far away from the seat. Movie offering is very extended with quite some recent movies in different languages. (A380 is more comfortable). Seats 41A & B are best, avoid 41C which passenger was hit all the time by transiting galleys As usual Changi airport is fabulous airport even with a transit time of 4 hours with next connection: gardens, swimming pool, butterfly and movie area is unique, European airports should learn and copy."

The seats in business class are awkward, to use the lie flat seat it is necessary to lie at an angle, and because of this it feels cramped. We left Sydney at 7.05 in the evening, and had the on board meal at approximately 8.00 pm, there was a choice and it was perfectly adequate. The flight to Singapore takes 7.15 hrs, there was a 1 hour change over of planes. After take off we were offered dinner again, which having already had an evening meal I passed. The flight to London from Singapore takes 14 hrs 35 mins. Breakfast is not available until 2 hrs before landing. It was served very late. I think the stewards should be aware of passengers who have been on the flights for 22-23 hrs, and be prepared to offer breakfast much earlier. We will not be travelling Singapore airlines again."

I have been flying Singapore Airlines for the past thirty years. I have noticed a visible degradation in the quality of service over the years.  Ever since the introduction of the Premium Economy class, the quality of the service in the economy class has declined. The flight attendants go about their tasks mechanically, with little or no interaction with passengers. The food is mostly inedible. During my most recent flight, I opted for the Dim Sum breakfast between Hong Kong and San Francisco. The soggy, mushy items had no resemblance to Dim Sum items I have had anywhere. While US airlines such as Delta and United have vastly improved service for economy travelers, Singapore appears to be goading their economy passengers to upgrade to the significantly more expensive Premium Economy class. However, it is very hard for me to justify spending an additional $1000 just to get two upgraded meals and a slightly larger TV screen."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Frankfurt to Singapore,March 2018,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,2,"  Frankfurt to Singapore. The flight attendants are some of the nit-pickiest I've ever seen. My crime was sleeping during the pre-flight video. The experience was no better than average. The food wasn't special, the premium economy seat was a premium economy seat. It got worse on the way back when we stopped at the Star Gold lounge to discover what is the worse Gold lounge I've ever been to. It felt more like a private waiting area than a lounge, it doesn't even have its own bathrooms. Singapore is doing the bare minimum to provide the benefits as part of Star Alliance.  Lufthansa gained a star - maybe Singapore needs to lose one."

As usual, excellent service onboard. Very professional service crew and very courteous and helpful. Saw many of them helping passengers with their requests such as blankets, baggage, newspapers. The food is also good and sufficient. The choice of movies were great though I wished the plane was equipped with the newer wider screens."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Singapore,February 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,4,yes,9," First time flying on the A350 and it makes the flight from Munich to Singapore considerably more comfortable than on the 777. As usual Singapore Airlines staff were friendly and professional, as we were traveling with a toddler, we were invited to board first and get ourselves settled. Stewardess came by to check if we needed anything for our daughter and if we would like our meals at different times. Seats were comfortable, row 41, which has the advantage of lots of leg room but has fixed armrests which hems you in a bit. There is an extensive selection of movies which will keep most people entertained for a flight longer than the 11 hours we had. SQ is saving money a bit with the food portions getting smaller but flavour and quality were still there. A350 is quiet and the lower cabin preasure is noticeable in that you arrived refreshed even after the long flight, I even managed a few hours sleep. Flight departed a bit late but arrived 30 min ahead of schedule. Once again Singapore Airlines is a great way to fly."

I always travel business class (though first time on SIA fleet) and conclude that Singapore Airlines is the best. The aircraft are up to date and so are the facilities. Neat, clean and comfortable. But, it is the staff that take the airline to the next level - courteous, friendly, helpful and efficient especially the cabin crew on flights SQ 479, JHB to Singapore, 10 Feb and SQ 478, Shanghai to Singapore, 28 Feb 2018."

Seat was hard and thin, food  of average quality. Cabin staff spoke quietly. Return flight was on a Boeing 777 with newer cabin. Seats were excellent, they fold down from the back so the bed is on the back of the seat. A bit of fussing around to set it up but super comfortable and very wide. But it needs to be wide as someone 181cm tall still needs to lie on an angle, as the foot cubby-hole is not in line with the seat centre-line. "

First time I have flown with Singapore Airlines and it was an eye opener. The staff are actually genuinely friendly and the service and products are excellent.

Check in was quick and smooth. The boarding was orderly and the crew greeted the passengers with a smile. Found a pillow and blanket on my seat. The seat and leg room was average. No footrests but liked the flexible adjustable headrests. Flight left only a few minutes late from the scheduled take off. Shortly after take off the crew came out with hot towels, snacks, drinks and food menu. There were enough alcoholic drinks to choose from. I got myself a Tiger beer but I had to ask for second beer, would have preferred if the crew had offered. Food was fresh and tasted great, didn't taste like airline food at all. There was salmon with coleslaw, crackers and cheese, bread roll and butter along with 2 choices of main course. My Asian beef curry was delicious. For dessert we had fresh fruit salad and gelato. The best meal I have had on a flight and this was all in economy class. The let down was the IFE. The screens were small and had poor resolution, no touchscreen either. The headphone jack was fiddly, I was using my personal headphones but occasionally I would lose sound in either left or right channel. I watched Dunkirk (2017), which was good. On arrival the luggage arrived quickly and without any damage. Overall a good flight but was disappointed with IFE. The ticket was also expensive compared with other airlines."

My wife and I were planning a vacation to SE Asia, so I bought round-trip tickets between San Francisco and Singapore on the Singapore Airlines web site. The next day I was looking for tickets to Siem Reap for a side trip to Angkor Wat when I discovered on Travelocity that Silk Air had the best flights, and that Silk Air was a part of Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines website did not make this clear at all. So I called Singapore Airlines to add these Silk Air flights to my booking. Imagine my surprise and disbelief when I was told I had to pay a $500 penalty because this ‘change’ came two hours after their 24 hour change deadline. I talked to two of their supervisors, but they also insisted on this penalty. It did not matter that Silk Air was hidden deep within Singapore Airlines website. It did not matter that I was adding Singapore Airline flights to my itinerary. It did not matter that I was only 2 hours past their 24 hour ‘deadline’ Since my Singapore Airlines flights were non-refundable I had no choice but to pay the $500 penalty. Just booking the Silk Air flights separately would have cost me an extra $690. In a situation that clearly called for a little flexibility and compromise Singapore Airlines showed none. For that reason they have earned my lowest rating."

✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Brisbane,February 2018,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Singapore to Brisbane. A great example of how business class should be done. Practically a brand new aircraft which features the latest Singapore business seats. The 1-2-1 configuration is perfect for privacy and easy aisle access. In my opinion, the hard product that Singapore offers, as well as the crew is what makes them stand out from the rest. The seat and entertainment system are great - and the seat converts to a reasonably comfortable bed. For a bit of extra room, I'd recommend the first row (Row 11) of business as there is a bit more leg space. Food was good and as I had ordered book the cook, my choice was already taken care of and served promptly after takeoff. Wine selection was good and my glass was never empty. The A350 features inflight wifi and Singapore now offers 30Mb for free to business class passengers which worked well for me and provided just enough to check emails a few times during the flight. The standout was the exceptional level of service provided by the crew. Business class was fairly empty (only 10 seats occupied on this flight), but as it was an overnight flight, it would have been very easy for the crew to disappear. However, the service was constant without being ""in your face."" A great experience with Singapore, and the A350 certainly makes travel very pleasant."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Coimbatore to Melbourne via Singapore,February 2018,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  Coimbatore to Melbourne via Singapore. I travelled with my 16 month old baby and SIA did not offer me a bassinet seat although I had requested for it before hand. They said that they have children younger than mine who needed it. I understand that but they should have offered me a spare seat or upgraded me to business class. I had to travel from Singapore to Melbourne with not enough leg room. On top of it the cabin crew didn't bother to provide any food for the baby. They didn't offer me an infant seat belt (I had to insist on one). Singapore airlines is not cheap and we pay the extra money for a comfortable travel. I have been flying Singapore airlines for the past 10 years and this has been the worst travel ever.

Disappointed firstly we were only given one glass of champagne, not duplicates as advertised. Secondly we chose meals via Book the Chef and we had finished our meals before we were offered wine and then only a small glass supplied. We were offered no snacks and the curtain was drawn very quickly and passengers were quickly sent to the rear of the aircraft if they entered the curtain wall. This was in complete contrast to the flight from London to Singapore which was superb. We were offered champagne top up and crew could not be more helpful. Hope it improves on the return!"

Dinner was acceptable , breakfast was a let down as a muffin can hardly pass as a continental breakfast as the menu suggested. The strong point of the airline remains with the cabin crew who were extremely attentive and efficient right throughout."

Aircraft is fully equipped with the right entertainment and facilities for a long haul flight. The strong point of the airline remains with the cabin crew who did an efficient and friendly job managing the cabin. The catering however, was a major let down as there was no International option and the breakfast was merely a muffin, which is a pathetic excuse for what is marketed as a ‘continental breakfast’. Ground staff at both ends were remarkable."

Push back on time but queuing on the taxiway for take off for another 25 mins before take off. The economy cabin was probably 60% full so we had 3 seats between the two of us. A few lucky travellers had 3 seats each so could get some reasonably comfortable sleep. The plane was clean. The set back TVs in excellent condition. The cabin temperature was just right too. Cabin crew very attentive and regularly came through the cabin with juices or water. The two meals were tasty as were the mid flight snacks of meat rolls, crisps and chocolate. As ecomony goes this has got to be one of the best offerings for long haul. However I would say that when the seat in front is reclined it is very intrusive into your personal space and makes watching your own TV screen uncomfortable. The only answers then for you too to recline your seat. If only everyone would just keep their seats upright! The outbound trip 3 weeks earlier was equally as comfortable. 5 stars all round!"

I dont know why Singapore Airlines chose a seat which needs a crew member to set it up before sleeping. If you want to recline the crew member again has to disable the sleep position. Sleeping at a angular position is not comfortable. Apart from this the crew were very attentive, caring and the quality of AVML was very good."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Jakarta,January 2018,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,3,yes,7," Singapore-Jakarta-Singapore in January. It's been 10 years since I flew Singapore Airlines and boy they've gone downhill since. Cabin service on both legs was really indifferent, especially on my evening flight back from Jakarta. Flown on many other airlines before but none except SQ offered me just ""coffee and tea"" during the meal service. Had to wait for another cabin attendant to pass by before I could get anything other than a hot drink. To a more discerning traveller it suggests cost cutting which is not cool. Inflight entertainment was mixed. Flight to Jakarta had one of the newest systems on the A350 but back home I was surprised to discover how far SQ is behind. No touch screen for the A330s in economy! Ground service was also a mixed bag - good in Singapore but underwhelming in Jakarta where my flight was delayed for almost an hour. No announcement and no apology until we we were all aboard. Can't fault their catering, which to my surprise was very good. Also, SQ android app is probably one of the best I've used and had no problem checking in for my flight on a phone. But my final verdict is that while SQ is not awful it's not that great or special either. Needs to improve a lot to catch up with airlines such as EVA and Turkish which I think are among the best these days."

Pleasant Crew, food OK. Nice menu and small amenity kit. The crew seemed very nice and polite but a little robotic. No personalities. The food was ok, seats great because it’s still 9 across in Economy. Many other airlines are 10 across. Impossible to sleep due to the fact that the seat belt sign was turned on and off every 20 minutes and the captain and crew made really loud PAs. Now I understand that it’s a safety issue. Almost all other airlines have a faster seat belt message come up on your screen. By the 4th OA at 4 am I was ready to lose my cool. Also like other rules I’ve never experienced before with competing carries. I was told that because I was at the bulkhead, if there was turbulence I’d have to restore my back. I thought that’s no going to happen. So all in all a nice airline but a lot of hype."

Some hostesses were very brusque and at odds to the image this company likes to portray. On the return trip in particular, the cabin was only 1/4 full and the service was very rushed. There should be no reason for this on a 8.5 hour flight with a full complement of staff. There were a few ambitious types who tried to look like they were in charge of the others but I guess you get that sort everywhere. No individual air vents."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Chennai to Los Angeles via Singapore,January 2018,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,2.0,3,no,5,  Chennai to Los Angeles via Singapore. I have been flying this route on Singapore Airlines for about 30 years. Although the overall level of service is good there has been a decline in passenger facilities and comfort. Their Business class lounge in Chennai is a joke with about 20 seats in a small enclosure resembling a neglected warehouse. The seats on the Singapore - Los Angeles segment are flat beds but they are difficult to operate. Most people needed assistance from the flight attendants to switch between the flat bed and regular seating positions. Meals are ok but nothing great. The in flight entertainment is below average. There is the annoying halt for just over an hour in Tokyo where all passengers have to disembark and go through security before re-boarding the aircraft. Overall Singapore Airlines will no longer be my first choice carrier unless they attend to these issues.

Singapore to Tokyo Narita.  Premium Economy Class Seats: Wider and well-cushioned. However, we were disappointed with quality. The buttons for recline and the foot rest was not working well. We actually had to force the foot rest out. This certainly isn't expected for Singapore Airlines (ANA on the contrary had everything in tip top condition). Entertainment: One of the airlines with the most decent entertainment. However, my headset was faulty. It was replaced but again, not expected. It should have been checked. Food: I used ""Book the Cook'. I expected the food to be better but found it so-so. Cabin crew took a really long time to clear the food. When I tried to return it, I was flatly rejected, the crew told me to wait. The entire process from start to end took 2 hours! It was crazy! SQ 633 was way much more efficient. Crew was pretty cheerful and the crew made the effort to confirm our meals with us before they took off. They surprised us with an anniversary cake as well. We like the customer engagement they provided. SQ 12 on the other hand appeared grouchy and unhappy to me - no confirmation on the food was made and they took so long to finish the meal service. Premium Economy has a cabin on its own. However, on both flights, the curtains were not drawn. We had passengers from Economy trying to sneak into the Premium Economy seats or use the toilets in Business Class. There were also kids (in Economy class) walking to and fro the Premium Economy cabins. This should have been controlled as my husband was trying to do some work on the plane and I was trying to rest but could not. While I try to be understanding on young children in the plane, it is definitely awful to have a child crying/screaming for 6 hours on a 7 hours flight. What made it worse was that seats with bassinets in the Economy class were directly behind the Premium Economy class. Overall, we were not very impressed with the quality of Premium Economy Class. Singapore Airlines have always been expected to be premium (along the lines with ANA/Qatar/Emirates). For the amount of money spent, I would very much go for ANA."
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Singapore,January 2018,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,2.0,2,no,3,"  Frankfurt to Singapore, Business Class. I got an email early morning on 9 January to notify me that the flight  was to be delayed by 2 hours. As I was connecting with Air New Zealand at Singapore onwards to Auckland with a short connection time, I thought the chance of catching the connecting flight to Auckland was going to be impossible. That proved correct. Prior to arriving at the airport, I rung both SQ and Air New Zealand. Both airlines claimed it was each other’s responsibility. In short, SQ was to blame for the disruption, so it was their responsibility to put things right. When we were due to board at Frankfurt, the A380 was not at the terminal, it was at a distant part of the airport so we were bussed to the plane which seemed to be miles away. When we finally arrived at the plane, we had to climb a set of steep stairs to enter the plane. Considering the delayed flight and the inconvenience we had been through, the greeting from the staff was very ho-hum. The crew seemed to be grumpy during this flight. The poor guy in front of me had a seat adjacent to the galley door way. He asked to be reseated somewhere else in the business section. The stewardess’s response was, sorry, we are fully booked. This wasn’t the case as there was a vacant seat behind me. The meals were very Asian, with a lot of seafood options, in some cases I chose to forego the course as there was just nothing I liked. I would recommend SQ’s “book the cook” option. There are far more options available using this than SQ offers on the flight. Come time to sleep, my bed was broken. It lay flat ok, its just that when I put my weight on the bed the feet end of the bed couldn’t sustain the weight and my feet would go right through to the floor. I slept, but it wasn’t great. I wasn’t the only one to complain of this problem. When the flight arrived in Singapore there were a team of SQ agents waiting for arriving passengers whose connecting flights were affected by the delay. In all fairness, SQ did handle this very well, they provided a 4 star airport hotel for 12 hours along with 3 meals. The journey on to New Zealand continued with SQ and I can basically say, I saw a repeat of the service issues I had on the Frankfurt/Singapore flight. I can’t recommend SQ and probably won’t chose to fly with them again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo to Los Angeles,January 2018,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,3,no,3,"  Tokyo to Los Angeles. Cabin was clean and with decent space for knee room for a 5'3 female. Complimentary 2 bag check in which was nice. Amenity kit provided complimentary containing tooth brush, paste, and socks. No slippers or eye mask as other airlines. Bathroom needed to be better maintained as waste bin was full by hour 4 out of 12 hour flight, soaps in disarray and bathroom prep tray (mouth wash etc). Special meal service was kind although a bit disappointing as you do not decide what meal you would like to eat but it is already prepared generic “western style” of whatever meal selection chosen. I would’ve loved to pick my meal with the changes applied, especially knowing tickets were booked ahead enough. Food was decent, but often the crew would overlook my seat and miss out several beverage//snack passes due to special needs. This was not at all an issue flying USA to Japan. But an issue on this flight. Main complaint is how crew could’ve done better to handle special requests with passengers. I booked and had a seat arranged, by surprise there were no shows in my row. Instead of privately making me aware of any request, an attendant publicly asked for my seating reassignment so that I may switch places with another passenger so that they my lie across the row with their bad knee. I’m partially deaf in one ear and spinal braced. Instead of privately requesting in writing, the crew member and requesting passenger makes a scene for me to move because I am unable to hear. So speaking louder while in flight should be better. There should be a better way for flight crew to handle those with special needs such as mute, deafness, and hidden disabilities instead of causing a scene or skipping passengers who cannot speak. Be like other airlines that have crew member buttons on the seat panels such where passengers can press for assistance or communicate needs."

Smooth check in at New Delhi airport where they do also weigh your hand carry; something I did not see at Changi. Boarding procedures were seamless. The dated seat on the 772 was quite comfortable although there was no USB port to charge smartphones. Beautiful celebratory wreaths decorated the cabin walls. Singapore Airlines give big, fluffy pillows and blankets in economy class. You can select newspapers and headphones while boarding. Hot towels and menus were served.  Singapore Airlines service standards are stellar. IFE on board differed on the 777 and A380. Screens unfortunately were not that clear or clean on both aircraft. The vegetarian oriental meals I ordered on both flights were super. Crew provide refreshments and the cabin presence on board was beyond any other airline in economy class I have flown. "

An old plane (compared to the ones advertised recently) huge seat. Very personalised service from check in to the plane. Pyjamas offered on board, even for this relatively short (around 6 hours flight). Book the cook service offered an amazing selection of food, however I chose the inflight menu with the Japanese selection. It was fantastic for a supper menu! The bed is made by collapsing the back of the seat and is quite comfortable. Inflight entertainment was a bit tough (the remote was quite old). There was inflight wifi however I didn't use it. The whole experience is definitely recommendable."

The airline had the old cabin product, and it really shows. The panel which supposed to cover the compartment to store smaller items near the screen was missing, and the steward explained that only the engineering people can fix this. The seat was wide, however the awkward shape of the leg area makes it very hard to be comfortable, as we had to sleep diagonally (the new cabin product as we see online removed this problem). First class seats did not have this issue. Sleeper service (our flight departed at 10.50 pm) means that supper was only two course (instead of the three courses with Satay) - which was main meal and a bowl of fruit. Inflight entertainment offered the latest movies, however the screen was quite old and we noticed some scratches on the screen. Service was exceptional trademark of Singapore Airlines. I would recommend this airline despite the old product still."

Their attentiveness to passengers were impressive especially the attendant looking after my area (seat # 50s). I sat on the aisle side of a middle row seats. The person sitting next to me, in the middle seat, inquired for an aisle seat and was informed of this availability just a few rows back. He probably didn't act fast enough, somehow he stayed put. I didn't feel like eating & kept the dessert (amazingly the attendant noticed, asked if the food didn't meet my standard and if she could offer me something else. Wow! What airline does this!). I decided to sleep through the long flight. Feeling cold, I tucked myself in with blankets. The middle seat person apparently had to exit his seat numerous times. Instead of exiting from his right, where a gentleman was seated,who was not sleeping, was not working, was not tucked in, nor was he sleeping, he decided to pass through my seat. Each time, I had to re-tucked myself in. At one point, he dropped my dessert and spilled my left over white wine over me. Again the crew came to action, even brought her personal parfum spritzer so as to alleviate the wine smell on me. Singapore Airlines, I know you have a great team but the one looking after my area outdid everyone else on flight SQ31 from Singapore to SFO. Thank you!"

This sector was the second sector of my flight back from Vienna, the VIE-BKK sector being on Austrian Airlines. As a short 2-hour regional flight, SQ still lives up to its reputation of being a premium airline. Shortly after take-off, dinner service commenced with a choice of 2 main courses. Being a short flight, menu cards were not distributed to passengers. Instead, flight attendants showed passengers a menu card with photos of the main courses and descriptions of the meal. I had the chicken casserole with penne pasta. Drinks and coffee or tea were served at the same time. As it was a short flight, I did not watch any movies on the IFE. One difference that I noticed was that earphones distributed were of the in-ear type instead of the over-ear type typically used by SQ. Perhaps in a move to save costs, headphones in economy are no longer of the over-ear type? I can’t confirm this as it has been some years since I have flown SQ economy."

✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Zürich via Singapore,December 2017,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Kuala Lumpur to Zürich via Singapore. This was our first trip with our baby girl (6 months old). Sadly, as we landed in Singapore from Kuala Lumpur for Transit to Zurich, our baby had high fever. After checking in the clinic at T3 of Changi Airport, it was clear we couldn't continue our route. Instead, our baby had to go to a Hospital in Singapore. Ground staff assistance was great, Both the employees of Changi Airport as well Singapore Airlines helped us in every aspect. They unloaded and stored our luggage, helped us with immigration and the transport to the hospital. Our baby was admitted in the Hospital. During those days, we had steady contact with SIA. They rebooked our flight 2 times (as the doctors couldn't say for sure when our baby will be discharged) with no extra charge and being very supportive. As i understood, our price saver tickets gave them no obligation to do this for free - but to our great relief they did. They really gave us help and support in this hard time for us, showing us that even in todays world there is place for compassion. That there are times when paragraphs and formal rules are less important than the care for people in need and worry. We like to thank all the involved people from SIA and Changi Airport - you helped us when we needed it the most. Once our baby was healthy again and could be discharged, SIA helped us with our luggage and checkin in, making sure it all goes smooth. We had our bassinet seat, the flight in the A380 was good as can be with a baby. Onboard staff was attentive and supportive, food was OK."

I arrived at Surabaya airport T2 a little bit early and luckily the check in counter was open, the check in experience was fast and smooth, and I was granted a window seat. We boarded the A330-300 on time and took off on time. Lunch service started and I was amazed how they serve a hot meal on a 2 hour flight. This time the options were lasagna or chicken with rice, I chose the chicken with rice and it was amazing. Most cabin crew could speak Bahasa. 6 days later I arrived at Singapore Changi T3 very early, the check was all automatic even the baggage drop. Singapore Changi is one of my favourite airports so waiting for 5 hours wasn't a problem, to kill some time we went to the butterfly garden and after that the cinema which was playing some pretty good movies. I got a window seat on this flight. We took off on time and dinner service was good. I started to watch the IFE, had a good sleep after that and woke up for breakfast. I highly recommend flying Singapore Airlines."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300er,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brisbane to London via Singapore,December 2017,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,5,yes,10," Brisbane to London via Singapore. The attentive crew made flying long haul by economy into a lovely experience. From Brisbane, the B777-200er plane was a bit dated, noisy and the seats were comparatively hard. Some seats have IFE boxes taking up some foot space, and the entertainment selection is more limited than the newer planes (e.g. No full box sets). However the crew service with hot towels, amenities packs and attention to detail more than made up for it. The first leg was late departing Brisbane, but without even having to ask, the staff on the ground assured us by announcement that we would make up time en route and sure enough, we did, even arriving early into Changi. This was a relief for me as I only had a 50 minute connection time. The plane change at Changi was easy and seamless. The second leg was on the B77-300er. I found this plane less quiet than the A380 alternative on this leg, but still very comfortable. The ambient lighting and temperature were pleasant. The crew kept the cabin spotless, regularly removing rubbish and cleaning the toilets. They also kept a close eye on the cabin at night, regularly offering drinks and snacks to those awake without having to be asked. The gracious crew go the extra mile to make a long journey special. Having flown this journey with most carriers, I will be a loyal Singapore Airlines customer."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Perth via Singapore,December 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1, Hong Kong to Perth via Singapore. Absolute disgrace. Randomly selected seats for my family all over the aircraft. Last flew with this airline a couple of years ago and it was brilliant. It seems poor now. Entertainment onboard was busted. I travel regularly and would seriously say that even a budget airline is better than Singapore Airlines. Do yourself a favour and give this airline a wide berth.

First time I've flown with this airline since 1991, and I couldn't fault the flights at all. I'm reasonably tall (5'8"") with long legs, but I had plenty of seat room. Service was exemplary, and I liked the extra touches of menus and the little convenience bag, containing socks, toothpaste and toothbrush, and an eyeshade. Food was pretty good, and the entertainment choices excellent. Despite a tight connection in Singapore (50 minutes) I still had plenty of time to catch my connecting flight. I wouldn't hesitate to fly Singapore Airlines again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Sydney,December 2017,2.0,,,,,1.0,2,yes,2,"  Delhi to Sydney via Singapore. The first leg from Delhi was with Jet Airways (to be followed by the Sydney leg with Qantas). The Jet Airways flight was half an hour late and it was obviously decided before we landed that we would not be allowed to board the ongoing leg, as we were collected and ushered to get new boarding passes for a much later flight. We were then offered a flight only 3.5 hours later with Singapore Airlines and the staff at Singapore Airport completed all the documentation, including the transferring of our bags. But all our bags have gone missing and did not turn up in Sydney. I realise that they are still in ""tracking"" mode, however we are desperate to get them back before Christmas. We have tried all day calling Singapore Airlines, but they do not answer."

However on this flight, service seems rushed. It felt that they were rushing to complete many tasks. Although it didn't affect me, their stress didn't give me a very relaxed feel. Knowing that this a short flight, I can understand why they were rushing to complete tasks. If they can mask that stress, that will be perfect.  This was an older aircraft so the entertainment system was a bit dated. It didn't bother me much as I had my own book to keep me occupied on the journey. Overall, it was a good flight."

Not just the reviews but the additional cost of premium. The first leg to Singapore was poor. The air crew are fully engaged with economy and consequently are not seen. The second leg was so much better due to the air crews attitude and attention. Ironically the second leg was economy. Certainly on the first leg premium on the 777-300 I do not feel the seat justifies the significant increase in cost. The majority of passengers around me had been upgraded from economy. The economy seat on the second leg near the exit was just as comfortable so unless you are flying business I would suggest econony seat near the exit. Maybe the A380 is better premium but not the 777-300

The food (IVML) served on my flight from Sydney to Singapore was horrible.  I complained to the cabin crew staff and was not offered a replacement so went without food. The food on Singapore to Delhi flight was also below average. I previously always had an above average experience with SIA but looks like they are cutting costs. I pay a premium to fly with SIA and expect services of acceptable standards. Will not fly with them in future.

The cabin crew in general was warm, and tended to our needs promptly throughout the flight. However the Boeing 777-200ER, is one of the more antiquated aircraft in SQ's fleet and it is in desperate need of a makeover - for one, the IFE looked like something that came from the 1990s or the early 2000s, and the IFE was not very responsive, and ended up jamming up 1hr before landing in Hong Kong. If that was not bad enough, my friend who was seated next to me(seat 45B) suffered from less legroom than other economy class passengers due to the IFE box that was under the seat in front of his. However, the service from the flight attendants was outstanding-no surprises as to why SQ can consistently rank as one of the top airlines. On the return flight, the equipment was the same; however, the aircraft came in late, and departure was delayed by 15 minutes! On top of that, after boarding we could not push back due to ""traffic congestion"" and ended up taking off 1 hour behind schedule! Hardware wise, still the same experience as the outbound flight; however, the cabin crew was just as warm, polite and made us feel welcomed on board and attended to our every need promptly-again, top marks for that. All in all, a pleasant flight experience with Singapore Airlines and given the price, would definitely choose them again"

A highly motivated crew made this short flight an unforgettable experience. They spoiled us from entering the cabin until we left the cabin. The pre-ordered over ""Book the Cook"" ""Grilled American beef fillet"" was a delight. The selection of drinks was very good. Each passenger received a small bag of useful travel items as a gift. "

We arrived at Melbourne Airport 1 hour early not expecting the check-in to be open, the check-in counter was open and had no line. I requested a window seat and was lucky to get one in the front cabin, we were also told our flight might be full. We boarded the A380 with nice welcoming smile. Our seat had a blanket, pillow, IFE, coat hook and USB, we took off on time and once we were in the air, we were handed out the amenities kit which included socks, eye-mask and toothbrush. Food service started and the options were Turkey or Chicken sandwich, the man next to me did not want to eat but the crew insisted, I chose the Turkey sandwich and, it was amazing, my drink choice was coke, then I fell asleep. I woke up just in time for breakfast and the options were rice vermicelli or omelette. I chose the rice vermicelli which was OK, I had orange juice for my drink. We had a smooth landing in Singapore Changi T2 and had 30 minutes before boarding the flight to Jakarta. We just made our flight and I was given a window seat, I asked for a glass of water because I had run across the terminal and staff happily said yes and gave it to me with an ice cube, great start. We took off on time and the lunch service started straight away, I chose Nasi Goreng instead of omelette, the fried rice was the best plane food I had ever eaten, I had apple juice as my drink. Excellent customer service."

First, the crew are professional, very kind and helpful. Secondly, the seating is very generous in terms of comfort and space. The business class on a Airbus 350 could compete with some first classes on other airlines or older airplanes. The entertainment on board is up to date and there is plenty of choice for those who can not sleep during long flights. Food is excellent, staff are nice. It's worth it."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Singapore to San Francisco via Hong Kong,November 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,2,no,1,"  Singapore to San Francisco via Hong Kong. Worst flight ever. I paid for an extra legroom seat 41c. This seat is supposedly bulkhead but it isn't. This is an isle seat which has the isle for the cabin directly in front of it. This means that the food trolley has to make a 45 degree turn into your cabin thereby making you move or be hit by the trolley every time. In fact they slammed the trolley into the arm of my chair every pass. You can only sleep if you encroach into the middle seat and cross your legs which we all know is a health hazard. The crew just grinned each time I was jarred awake. Only once did they say sorry. I complained and the airline said sorry it hasn't been an issue before. Most airline these days have a good movie selection, not this one. Food was awful. Glad we had our own water as they hardly bring any around. I know this is a long flight but the crew were terrible."

Being the first row, it has extra leg space. The PE seat is upholstered in leather and had a good recline. AC socket, USB port were available in each seat. For each of the two meals served on this route, there was a choice of 3 main courses on the menu. During the 10 hour flight, flight attendants came around often to offer drinks at regular intervals. In between meals, there was a snack service with a choice of fruits, sandwiches and chips. The selection of movies and music for inflight entertainment is extensive and probably one of the best if not the best. Noise cancelling headphones are provided for best acoustic effect. As always, Singapore Airlines maintains a high level of inflight service and this flight is no different."

Lower deck on the first flight with a spare seat next to me so very comfortable. The 777 was a full flight but a short one so not a problem. HKG to SIN upper deck 2 seats comfortable. SIN to LHR we were moved from downstairs to 2 seats at the very back. Upstairs is quieter but it was very cold requiring two blankets. The meals were mostly not to my taste as they were spicy but the wonderful cabin crew tried their best to find me an alternative. They even found me a dessert that was not ice-cream for which I was very grateful. Regular drinks rounds and snacks on offer. The toilets were kept clean. The soft furnishings are starting to look shabby and I don't see the point of the footrests but those are the only negatives. Four safe flights and luggage arrived too so a very positive experience."

In April, to my knowledge, SQ 346 is very often packed and seat reservation might be difficult if you are two but on a different booking. On this particular flight I took a so called P seat which is next to the exit. Actually there is a lot of legroom left on the other side of the metal, there's permanently cold air coming up from the door. As often for a early morning flight 01.20am people are some of harshly due to sleep shortness. The cabin crew is very patient even if some become aggressive sometimes. "

The flight SQ970 departing 07.15h is during weekdays always very busy as business people are traveling for a one day business trip to Bangkok. Obviously many are not able to book a business class seat due to limited availability.

✅ Verified Review ,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Canberra to Wellington,November 2017,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Customer service fail.  My wife and I had a booking for March 2018 to fly Canberra Australia to Wellington New Zealand, one way. This relates to customer service pre-flight, not comfort or service on a flight. Booking was no problem and great price. Our dates were not flexible due to other commitments. We received notification that our flight was cancelled (by the airline) and we had the option to accept an alternative (suggested flights nominated) or decline. Choosing decline gave a direction to call their help line. Called the number and despite stating our case several times that as there was no suitable alternative we would request refund we kept being offered alternative dates. Finally our request was understood (we were dealing with a human) and we were told that the operator did not have authority to action that request and our request would be forwarded to another area who would get back to us ""soon"". When asked for a timeframe we couldn't be given one. Now, I would expect that as this was the airline making the change, and, knowing that choosing decline would generate calls to the help line, a professional outfit would have provided that option for operators to action. But, no. It took a follow up email and then a second phone call to finally be advised that our request to cancel was actioned. When asked when we could expect a refund in our account we are told up to four weeks!! And, no advice of the amount to be actually refund, we have to wait for it to turn up before we can be sure full refund. Not good enough, and not what I would have expected from a full service airline that apparently prides itself on customer service. Thumbs down to Singapore Airlines."

The IFE selection was superb, very wide screen for economy class standard, plenty of choices on movies and TV shows and the quality of the headsets were decent. The flight attendants were very prompt and professional, I asked for several glasses of mineral water during coffee round, she took down the number of my seat and minutes later she returned with my request. Hot Breakfast was served before landing, I had some stir-fry noodles which looked unappetizing but tasted great. Unlike Qatar or Garuda, no basic amenities (eye shades, socks) were given. I would've given higher mark had they given us amenities pack."

It was such a great experience. At first I was a bit concerned because the layover was only an hour; I was afraid there would be any kind of delay that would potentially made me miss my connecting flight, but the flight was very punctual and we even arrived ahead of schedule. The cabin was clean with 3-3-3 arrangement, the legroom was spacious, the food was delicious, I really enjoyed having ice cream as dessert. The FAs were friendly and corteous. The only downside of the flight was the inflight entertainment system; the content was good enough with plenty of new movies but the hardware really fell behind. The screen was not a touchscreen, it was small, blurry and pixelated. I suggest other travelers to bring their own headphones like I did because the earphones were not comfortable. Over all it was a great flight and I would fly with them again"
✅ Verified Review ,Boeing 777-200 ER,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Christchurch,October 2017,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Singapore to Christchurch. Singapore Airlines business class is second to none. The moment you enter the aircraft, you are greeted by name and the flight attendant takes your drink and dinner orders. I chose the Lobster Thermidor from Book the Cook. It was delicious. Business class is a fine dining experience by itself. You feel that you are being pampered by the very friendly and polite flight attendants. The seat converts to a full flat bed where you can have a good sleep. Instead of pressing a button, you have to flip over the seat back to convert it to bed mode but the good thing is that the bed is wider than other business class seats which deploy using a button. You have to sleep diagonally with your body angled such that your legs fit into the cubby hole under the seat in front. Overall, it was a wonderful experience on this 9 hour 30 minutes flight. SQ is still top notch when it comes to service delivery on board."

This was a new A350 which was recently put in service. The seats were slightly narrower than the older business class seats; however in my opinion this does not decrease the comfort level. The seats were very comfortable and there were a lot of storage space for my belongings (to the point that we have to check every space before we leave the plane). The touch screen function is quite new from SQ and this made a lot of difference as older remotes can me quite tough to press as the plane ages. Service on the cabin was very good as usual; food was fantastic cabin crew were friendly and gracious. They were especially helpful towards by two parents, one with a wheelchair and the other less tech savvy with the entertainment system. Business class in SQ these days do not get much personal items given in the business class giveaway bag (compared to say LX and AY). However as this year was the 70th anniversary of SQ we were given a special leather bag."

Daytime flight thus the service quality becomes very important as there were not much sleeping time. A380 has been in service for a while thus the seats are quite worn and despite the best maintenance it still shows, the buttons are tough to press and the inflight entertainment remote is also quite tough to be responsive; having said this they  have promised to revamp the seats soon. The seats are quite wide and when converted to a bed the upper part of the seats are wide and comfortable but the lower part where the feet lays are a bit narrow. Food was fantastic as we applied for book the cook facility. The satay was amazing and the subsequent courses did not fail to please my family. Inflight entertainment was very good but I would have loved a wider collection of not-so-recent movies. The cabin service is fantastic; cabin crew makes an effort to recognize us and even some recognized us on other flights where they were on with us on a later date."

Compared to the competition for the same route, Singapore Airlines provides the biggest plane (AF used to serve the same route with their big plane but this ceased 2 years ago) with Garuda only providing 2 big planes for this route/ day. The big plane factor here matters, as the smaller planes tend to be parked away from the terminal and thus the passenger has to take a bus to the main terminal. Bigger planes almost always gets the aerobridge and thus the disembarkation process is way faster. For this 1.5 hour flight Singapore Airlines provides a meal (and also their full-service competition) and the speed of service for the food is amazing. The selection of food is pretty good however the selection for special diets have to be made online in advance. No connectivity on the flight. Leg space is pretty good compared to their competition; however the price for this route is pretty high, can be as high as a price from SIN to NRT on low season, for example."

Nevertheless, the cabin was well maintained, and the seats were comfortable and offered sufficient legroom. The food was very tasty. However, I was most impressed with the service of the cabin staff. I was wearing a suit, and the flight attendant asked me whether he could put the suit jacket on a hanger, which has never happened to me with any other airline."

I have to say the flight was in a very poor condition with Singapore Airlines. I was sitting on the upper level of the plan, and the interior is very dirty (marks  everywhere on the walls, handles, corners) and seat covers torn when I looked around. The entertainment system is a joke, I think may be back in at least 10 years you will see those airlines are using those system that you can't play the movie you chosen from the beginning and have to play them half way based on the entertainment system schedules. I was shocked to see any airline are still using those kind behind entertainment system, don't even mention it's Singapore Airlines, which will charge extra amount of money for nothing! The food was ok, typical airline foods. Service is good, but be honest I rarely see bad service in any airline, so I'd say it's standard. Overall, the aircraft in horribly poor condition as well as its entertainment system!"

It was a short haul flight which only lasted for 1 hr 45 mnt but really enjoyable. The food was decent for a short haul flight. It has 3-3-3 seat arrangement which is great and the legroom was spacious. I wish they could improve more on the flight entertainment system because even though the movie selection was great and had many new titles the touch screen was not responsive and the earphones were not comfortable enough"

Singapore Airlines provides a reliable and consistent service.  The flight attendants welcome passengers on board with smiles and are present to assist passengers to their seats and provide help with hand luggage, etc. There are 2 meal options and having flown this route over 5 times in the past 12 months, I have always managed to get the option of my choice. The entertainment options are wide and varied and the attendants present throughout the entire flight. The airline recently upgraded the earphones given out to passengers which passengers can bring home. Each earphone pack comes with 2 pairs of spare ear pieces of different sizes. This airline is definitely ahead of the curve and the challenge is to see how it maintains its lead during times where the industry is full of tough competitors without compromising on standards that its loyal customers have come to expect."

My husband and I chose Singapore Airlines for the first time to visit my brother who lives in Singapore. We thought it was one of the best company. Unfortunately, it has the worst customer service we’ve seen. Our return flight from Singapore to Paris was delayed by 3 hours so that we missed the connecting flight with Air France in Paris. All the flights to go home were full for the following 2 days. We had to buy by ourselves 2 train tickets (188 euros) to go back home. Our Air France tickets that we couldn’t use because of the delay were non-refundable. So we lost 246 euros because of SIA. After several mails to SIA (because they don’t reply to emails), the company doesn’t deign to pay 246 euros to compensate us. They only want to pay the difference between the train tickets end the Air France tickets (52 euros). Not logical. Plus, they don’t want to spend money to reply with postal mails. Only answers by email. Singapore Airlines don’t have consideration for their customers. They don’t take responsibility when their delayed flights have consequences on customers.  We will never fly again with Singapore Airlines."

AMS to SIN was in premium economy on an A350. The SIN to BNE sector was in standard economy on a Boeing 777. At this stage, Singapore Airlines doesn't offer premium economy to Brisbane. These two experiences were extremely different. In Premium, I paid a little extra to sit in the front row. I was able to extend my legs fully and adopt different seating positions. It was relatively comfortable. IFE was excellent. The large screen, extensive selection and quality headphones made the flight pleasant. Food was nice and the cabin crew were really professional. Changing in Singapore to standard economy - the seat was obviously narrower and my knees touched the seat in front. I could only adopt one sardine like position in my seat. All in all, it was quite uncomfortable for me. The food and service were efficient. The tiny screen was hard to see, having to often adjust the angle and on the 777, the selection was less than on the A350. In my opinion, there is a very distinct difference between standard and premium economy and I think the extra cost if well worth it."

✅ Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Sydney via Singapore,August 2017,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,4.0,1,no,3,"  Our holiday involved four Singapore Airline flights, Sydney to Frankfurt via Singapore and return. I bought and paid for four preferred seats. I have replacement knees and whilst they slightly limit my mobility, they do not adversely impact on my upper body strength or general fitness. The preferred seats would have given me more leg freedom. I purchased the preferred seats on-line and disclosed that I had a mobility problem. The tickets were sold with full disclosure by me. On the flights, we were refused the seats. It was then explained to me that it was the decision of the Cabin Crew ""on the day"" whether a person could occupy the preferred seats or not. We were moved further back down (both) aircraft and other people were seated in the preferred seats at no cost to themselves. It seems that the cabin crew make a decision whether the people in preferred seats are fit enough to assist other passengers in the event of an emergency. A total farce really, because they do allow women with babies to utilise these spaces. (So much for being fit enough to assist) On the last flight, the senior Cabin Crew person indicated she was submitting a report to assist me in having the money returned. I wrote to Singapore Airlines in late August. My email was acknowledged, then no further contact was received. I rang the Sydney office today and was told the money would not be refunded because the Airlines has a ""Not Negotiable/No Refund policy on preferred seat sales. My point is that those seats should not have been sold to anyone without a clear indication that it was a decision for the Cabin Crew ""on the day."" It was unpleasant sitting well back watching other people enjoying the seats I paid for. I will never fly Singapore Airlines again."

I haven't flown SIA for over 5 years, and was looking forward to renewing my experience. Overall a pleasant trip, but they seem to rather a shadow of their former self. I guess they are getting attacked by low cost airlines and Middle eastern airlines that have stolen many of their customers? Staff were efficient during the set times for service, but outside that this is a rather disappointing level of attention for business class. I had flown LAX to Tokyo one week earlier with ANA business class and have to say they are streets ahead of SIA from a service viewpoint. Seat on this A380 was comfortable, a little hard to sleep on, but quite private. Meals seemed quite small and dull compared to former standards. Used the inflight entertainment at beginning of flight and quite a nice choice. I probably wouldn't put them as first choice next time - they are a whole lot better than BA, but that is like comparing a low cost airline against SIA."

The staff was nice and helpful, on ground and in the plane, the flight was on time. I had a Boeing 777 on the way in and A380 on the way back, and, since that was my first travel with the A380, I'll focus on this one. First of all, this plane is awesome! It's so massive and  super silent. I paid for the extra space seat, which turns out to not be a super good idea. You paiy for more leg room but got an entertainment system in the armseat that is less pleasant than the normal, so, I'd say that's not worth it. But, anyway, service was good, but not extraordinary. Food was not so good to be honest, I was a bit disappointed and the service was nice but, I didn't find anything that stands out compare to any other big airline in my opinion. Seat was ok, I could sleep without too much discomfort, entertainment system was fine, no complaints about it. In the end, I had two nice flights, I really enjoy them but, I didn't find that the Premium Economy in a 5 stars airline was much different that a 4 star one. So, I'd recommend Singapore Airline, but, if you find the same seat category for less money in a less prestigious airline, I'd switch for the second one."

Fabulous service by the cabin crew on both trips. On the outbound flight the purser went through the cabin twice and asked everybody whether everything is ok. At the end of the flight he shook hands to a lot of passengers and thanked for flying SQ. Never seen before. I took the available ""Cook the book"" option for Premium Economy and had a vey tasty meal (Salmon noodles). Seat in the first row of Premium Economy to be recommended the other rows looked a little bit cramped. A lot of drink rounds on the day flight and also snacks available. Could use the Lufthansa Lounge as Silver Card member LH, but a little bit crowded at noon time, Silver Kris Lounge on the return flight a better options for meals and snacks, however (as some here have already mentioned) crowded between 10.00pm and midnight and the furniture need to be renewed urgently. Boarding in Singapore is smooth, flights on time, even ahead of schedule, good choice of entertainment. Just one neative point: Even there were quite a lot free seats in Business on the outbound flight, it was not possible to redeem my LH Miles on this flight despite several attempts during the last 6 weeks before departure"

Also lounge was very nice and spacious. Boarding process was well organized. On board the service is on really good level. Staff speaks good English and is kind. Meal service was really tasty. Our plane was quite old and it was visible in the entertaiment system. Screen in my seat had some problems with touch screen and it was lagging but with additional remote I was able to use it.

Both cabins were the new Business fit out and the seats (11K and 11A respectively) were of the new set up. The only issue is that I think there is a lack of storage space, and no drink tray (which is available on the A380) The A350 arrangement is newer of course and the individual cabin seems a bit smaller than those on the A380 and B777 (although the seat is the same width as on the B777). In reality the size seems to be on a good scale and uses the space well - it is very comfortable and all works well, and very roomy. Interestingly we were handed a small amenities kit on the Singapore to Barcelona flight - a first in my experience with SIA. The service on both flights was top notch and the attendants very friendly and attentive. The A350 flight seemed to be full, but the service was of a very high standard. We had a short stopover in Milan where we had to remain on the plane and there was a crew change. One of the flight attendants came up to say goodbye as she was leaving the plane. Very personal service. The A350 is a terrific plane - very quiet (much more so than the B777) and very smooth. I did feel better after this flight than other long haul flights so maybe the extra humidity and air pressure and better air conditioning worked. Meals and drinks were of a high standard and the toilet to passenger ratio seemed good. The only slightly negative thing was the Silver Kris lounge in Singapore - very crowded, and the showers are showing their age. However, I thoroughly recommend Singapore Air and the new A350."
✅ Verified Review ,,Business,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore,July 2017,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. My experience from HongKong to Kuala Lumpur was outstanding. I had booked the two flights on separate tickets as I had to add the trip to Kuala Lumpur on rather short notice. When booking the trip I took into account that the connection time in HKG was only 1 hour and 50 minutes between my SK flight and the Singapore flight. Being a frequent traveller with SAS I already asked to have my luggage checked through to Kuala Lumpur at Oslo airport, which was a very good choice as thus the SIngapore ground staff was prepared when the SK flight arrived in Hong Kong with a 80 minute delay. Despite I made it to the departure gate on my connection at last minute - exhausted after a long run through Hong Kong airport, the Singapore ground staff had already made a arrangement for me and my colleague to be booked on the next machine as the earlier flight had been anyway full. Both me and my colleague (who would not have made the connection as fast as me due to troubles at transfer security), we were both reassured, given new boarding passes and guided to the Singapore lounge for the next flight. All ground crew was very attentive and supportive and I appreciated this very foresighted arrangement, especially in the course that me and my colleague were actually booked on separate tickets. The flight itself was good, service was nice and attentive, but overall uneventful ."

Check in Rome was quick, efficient and friendly but from there it was all downhill. Singapore Airlines use a common use airline lounge in Rome not affiliated with any specific airline. Lounge is very dated and standing room only when full as it was on this day. Food offerings were a stale pound cake and a bowl of nuts. The bar area was covered in dirty used glasses.  I left the lounge and bought water from a vending machine. The aircraft was a refitted 777 that looked every bit it's 16 years old. The purser was very friendly and the rest of the crew in business class were also alright on the Rome to Singapore leg. The seat was large but very uncomfortable in seated and bed positions. The meal was not great and quality sub standard. The next flight out of Singapore to Melbourne while the aircraft was new was the biggest disappointment. The crew rushed both services and literally threw the table clothes and utensils down. Bread baskets thrust at passengers without offering bread. All done without uttering a single word to customers. From the noise coming out of the galley they were capable of talking and laughing just not with their customers.  I wouldn't have given more than 2 stars from their product and crew ."

First time trying the premium economy of Singapore Airlines, must I say I was really impressed by the offering and the value for money. Boarding in Hong Kong is done very orderly, Premium economy customers get to use the channel for gold card members. Separate counter for check in, priority luggage handling, and a generous allowance of 35kg! On board I was warmly greeted and shown to my new seat. Very impressed by the design, seat pitch, and storage space etc. Out of HK we had a delay of 1 hour due to heavy traffic, but crew handled it perfectly, with drinks and snacks given out, and air con on. Sharing the same toilet of economy is no problem at all. We were even offered champagne and nuts, not bad at all! Meals were from economy, but we could also book the cook for a few extra special dishes. Metal cutlery, wine and drinks offered. Nice premium ice cream offered at the end of the meal. AVOD has a large screen, touch screen for 777 and normal use of console for A380. Wifi is available, although not cheap, but those who needs it will find it very useful. Seat when reclined slightly, plus the footrest, makes for a very comfortable position for relaxation. For medium haul flight this is perfect. I can highly recommend it, sometimes the price can be cheaper than economy in high seasons."

The experience was fantastic, the service superb, and Singapore Airlines lived up to its ranking. The cabin is so quiet and the seats are the widest. Lie flat seat provides enough space for my 6ft plus frame, even if I did have to tilt a little to fit my feet in the slot. IFE was full of movies on a great screen and the food was delicious, especially Tiramisu. Don't miss the Singapore Sling, the signature cocktail of the airline. Only negative is that the cabin can tend to be warm, and there are no individual vent controls to adjust comfort levels."

We booked 5 seats in a row, 3 on the left side and the next 2 seats in the middle. Flying economy, our expectations were fairly low, but we were pleasantly surprised by the seats. The legroom was large, the seats were decently comfortable and in-flight entertainment system was excellent. Before taking off, the crew handed out hot towels and the menu, which was very nice. Shortly after take-off, the service began with a smaller snack before the stop in Moscow. Here, all passengers had to get off the airplane, even if you continued to Singapore. Moscow was an annoying but thankfully short stop. Be prepared to show your passport/bording pass 4-5 times though, as there were several controls, and one proper security checkpoint. Nothing insufferable, but annoying nonetheless. After taking off again from Moscow, the rest of the trip was a breeze. The service from the crew was excellent, with food, beverages and complimentary items. It was a 10 hour flight but it went by quickly thanks to the wonderful seat back entertainment system. There were more movies than you could ever hope to watch during a flight, as well as games, tv-series, books and music, all of it free! The only thing you had to pay for was the wifi. As such, I didn't check the cost, since I had enough free entertainment. As we began our descent the crew cleaned up nicely, and handed out the necessary immigration forms, if needed. The plane itself was only a few months old at the time and felt very modern. Everything looked stylish and clean. All in all, I am very impressed by Singapore Airlines economy class on this flight. I have flown business class once before, and this was honestly not that far removed from that service, excluding the seat of course. I'd happily fly with them again!"

The cabin staff were excellent in their attentiveness, and the upgraded IFE screens and controllers were a noticeable improvement from the ageing systems in the A380 and 777-300ER.

Our outbound leg was operated by a brand new A350. Despite the usually unremarkable ground service in CGK, we walked into the plane with high expectations, being known as a prestigious carrier here in Indonesia. Our previous flights with them has also been excellent. However, walking out of a Singapore Airlines plane for the first time in three years left us wanting for more. Sure, the A350 was an excellent aircraft in itself, with a spacious cabin, larger windows, high-tech LCDs for overhead signs and increased humidity, but unfortunately the flight experience overall has fallen miserably compared to our past flights with them as well as with competing airlines. Seat comfort was good but not great due to the hard leather headrests. Seat width was great, while pitch was nothing remarkable. Service was noticeably rushed, though crew were still professional, efficient and quite friendly. IFE was the most sophisticated and content-loaded I have ever experienced - complete with an extremely high resolution remote controller. However, it was not useful other than accessing shortcuts and viewing brief flight information. And then the food came: every single portion of the meal was lackluster - very severely below industry standards. Also, the ding sounds were played excessively throughout the flight, at an ear-splitting volume - they rung at least once every thirty seconds. How incredible. What's more, turbulence kept coming and going throughout the entire flight as well, and when it was time to land, we hit the ground very hard. Kudos to the pilot. The return flight was operated by a 16-year old 777-300, a stark contrast to the brand new A350 of the previous flight. However, this was much better: food quality was raised to industry standards - good, but not great, service was friendlier, but still far from the best out there, seat comfort was elevated thanks in part to the very soft and plush leather headrests; the constant ding sounds were replaced by an overall calmer ride interspersed with brief periods of turbulence. But what impressed me was the amount of space that each passenger in Economy Class receives: the amount of legroom was mind blowing. I could stretch out and still not feel claustrophobic. However, this flight also comes with its own share of flaws: crew service was not as efficient - they spent the first 20 minutes of cruise heating up food, and this caused my row to get the food only 30 minutes before arrival, and we finished our desserts as the plane was already midway through descent. Also, the IFE system is ancient and is in desperate need for a upgrade. The screens were also falling apart as well. Overall an inconsistent experience onboard SQ that has slightly declined since I flew them last three years ago."

Lo and behold, we arrived in Melbourne after enduring a painful flight in an old airplane with terrible food and fault inflight entertainment (had to be restarted twice) our baggages are nowhere to be found. Went to the baggage assistance area and talked to a very agitated agent who refused to explained the situation to us. Very disappointed with Singapore Airlines with this mix up. They are efficient when running smoothly within their protocols but anything out of ordinary reveals poor problem solving. "

From Singapore to San Francisco, attentive polite staff, great food, IFE system with many choices, easy check in, and now they use TSA Pre so my connection to a US carrier went smoothly as well. The only negative on the trip was the child in the row behind me who did what small children do from time to time. Ear plugs helped there. With SQ, the miles accumulation doesn't go very far, but ever since the US carreiers devalued FF miles, SQ is the way to go. THe WiFi is slow and $17 for the flight but if you need to check and send email it works."

The lack of pillow and blanket on board was a concern, even though it was just a short flight, and the fact that it was a day flight didn't mean that blankets were not necessary. The cabin temperature was freezing and when I asked the crew for a blanket, the reply I got was they have run out.  When the flight was approaching Singapore, we demanded for some disembarkation/embarkation cards, we only managed to get 2 for a total of 8 of us, because they have run out of these cards. In the end, we had to queue up before the immigration counter at Changi Airport to get the cards and to fill them in. The meal was very unsatisfying. Overall, the flight was just full of disappointment."

Aboard the plane, the flight attendants were very kind and cooperative. Cabin and seat features were very convenient and modern. The food was spectacular and movie choices were in a vast range. A blanket and pillow were provided even for a 3 hrs 50 min day flight from HKG to SIN. Overall, Singapore Airlines definitely brightened my trip to Singapore.

Initially when I flew on an A350 I felt that it was far too narrow unlike B777-300 ER. It's actually a very quiet plane and the seats are very comfortable. The lighting is very conducive especially for an overnight flight. However as I took SQ32 which was a morning flight out of Singapore it was some time before the cabin lights were switched off and when it does this is a super cool silent plane allowing one to relax and doze off to sleep and even when the lights are being switched on it was not like super glaring. Great plane and great flight and I did arrive fresher on this flight not when I flew on this aircraft for the first time in March than I would do on other types of aircraft.

They gave amazing meals and and customer service was great. The cabin staff were very friendly. Great people. The facilities were super. I did have some trouble with the wifi but I was still entertained by their range of music, games, movies, tv shows, etc. At the end of the flight I accidentally left my phone in the plane. I panicked and ran back to the plane however I was not allowed to re-enter. Then I saw the cabin staff and the manager as they were going home and I told them the situation. They quickly reacted asking me my seat number and three staff into the plane. I was very pleased by their efforts. The manager then calmed me down and everything. Shortly the men returned and thankfully they found my phone. I was very thankful to them as they took time out of their journey home to help with my situation. "

The arrival of SQ960 was delayed and our flight SQ961 was delayed even further. This was on July 7th. The congestion at the airport meant more waiting and the captain allowed passengers to call family and friends to inform them of the severe delay whilst we were on the runaway behind 6 planes. It was not a refitted 777-300 but as I did not have any passenger next to me it was fine. There was no wifi on board. This was a routine short haul flight. The flight attendants served dinner, they looked stressed and very little smiles but I guess it's understandable."

A disappointing inflight experience with Singapore Airlines. Seats are old and stained. The inflight entertainment screen was stuck and the angle could not be adjusted. Food was too salty for me.

Inattentive staff, cold food, broken in-flight entertainment equipment and terrible service.  I was with a friend when I boarded this flight and going back to Singapore after a semester of studies in Perth. We just had a rude encounter with a staff at the boarding gate and was hoping to get a warm welcome from fellow Singaporeans on the SIA flight. However we were received with hostile treatment from the cabin staff serving us on the flight. Had to pass through 5 flight attendants before we finally got an apple juice. First 2 attendants conveniently missed us when serving drinks to other passengers. The next 2 forgot our orders. Throughout these 5 encounters, we were received with rude attitudes which irritated, annoyed and angered us. It was a truly frustrating flight. A flight attendant also missed me when serving meals, had to be served by another from the other aisle. Apart from that, in-flight entertainment was faulty, didnt bother to announce before rebooting and after restarting. My remote had 1 button missing. Meals were not hot and rice was hard. I had previously tried Scoot for the first time from Singapore to Perth. Although the food was terrible, they provided a quality of service that could rival a full service airline and definitely beat the one provided by SQ on this particular flight.  Before this flight, I absolutely adored SQ. Now, I am seriously considering boycotting this airline for the treatment I received on flight. I seriously wonder if the old cabin crew who had built up such a wonderful reputation for SQ had moved on to serve in Scoot.  I don't think any customer deserves to be put through the horrible treatment my friend and I received on this flight. I honestly would have liked not having to sit through this torture."
✅ Verified Review ,A380,Business,Premium Economy,London to Melbourne via Singapore,June 2017,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,2,yes,6,"  London to Melbourne via Singapore. The premium economy is not really impressive. The seats are a bit bigger, but sometimes I feel like I'd rather have a window seat in economy and wedge myself into a comfort. It is handy if you want to do some work on your laptop during the flight, but not if you want to sleep. Singapore Airlines is a reasonable premium economy class option, but not as good as Qantas. The food is standard economy which I think should be expected. The extra money is paying for the seat. But I battled in it and didn't find the extra space that worthwhile.  The Wifi on SIA is an absolute joke. It was $10 for something like 50MB. I had to reload twice during the flight. Overall, I didn't think it was worth the price. If you are going to dig your hand into your pocket and spend money, go business. If not, grin and bear it in economy."

I also used for on board wifi but unfortunately Emirates has better offer for on board wifi due to less cost amount money compared to Singapore Airlines.

The service was good, as I boarded the aircraft one flight attendant escorted me to my seat. She even helped me out to put all of my things in the overhead bin. For the food, nothing better than Singapore Airlines food. That Lasagna with smoked chicken salad impressed me well. They also served a complete set menu for economy class starting from appetizer, main course and dessert. The chocolate mousse was totally delicious. The inflight entertainment was up to date. It had quite new movies and some great series, but unfortunately the screen had a slow response as I clicked the remote to move the channel.

✅ Verified Review ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Singapore via Hong Kong,June 2017,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,8,"  The flight on the San Francisco - Hong Kong sector was a long haul one and went through a longish route which had lots of turbulence. The Hong Kong - Singapore flight was shorter of 3 hours and was very smooth. The long haul flight was of 14 hours. A big meal was served after take-off though it was 2 am. It does not make sense to serve a heavy dinner at that odd time. Instead they could serve a good breakfast at around 7 am (PST). Then only snacks for the entire flight and another heavy meal just an hour before landing. This thing is a nuisance because you cant really enjoy a meal if you know you have to land in another hour. The breakfast served on the HKG-SIN sector was good and well timed. The toilets were clean and had the basic amenities. IFE was good on both flights. The seats were comfortable and so was the lighting etc. A big thank you to the SQ ground staff at SFO who excused my excess baggage of 5 kilos, without any extra charge. That was a very kind gesture and they put a tag on my bags to say that it was 'heavy""."
✅ Verified Review ,A380,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Sydney to London via Singapore,June 2017,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,3.0,1,no,2,"  My wife and I flew to London last week, with a Singapore stopover, choosing premium economy because we had a great experience flying on Qantas premium economy. We expected Singapore Airlines, another favourite carrier, to offer a similar product, and we had both had good Singapore Airlines flights before. But this flight was a terrible disappointment, and poor value for money. We are not looking forward to the return flight next month. With Singapore Airlines premium economy, you get a wider seat and better leg room. At the airport you check in separately, and there's a more generous luggage allowance. But that's all you get. We got the same food as economy (poor food compared to previous Singapore Airlines economy flights). The flight attendants served us and a large chunk of economy. Perhaps they were run off their feet: the only smiles were the neon-light style: turn on a smile and instantly turn it off again. When the food trolley came along there was a bottle of red and and a bottle of white wine on the top, but it was not offered. We were asked simply whether we wanted tea or coffee. I requested a glass of red, and was given it. I've no idea what sort of wine it was. The curried beef meal was poor economy class food at best, and far from what Singapore Airlines has offered in the past. Nobody came around after the meal to offer more wine, tea of coffee. After each meal, it took half an hour for anyone to come and remove our trays, so we were stuck in our seats and unable to go the toilet. My wife eventually lost patience and took her tray and returned it to the kitchen herself. Flight attendants were there, but offered no thanks or apology for the delay in retrieving the trays. On the long night flight leg to London a day later it was much the same. We were not even offered eye masks, though I was given one when I requested it. I've never flown an international night flight before when an eye mask wasn't offered. The curtain between premium economy and economy was never closed on either flight, and children from economy wandered into our aisle at will. As we approached London, our last meal was a breakfast omelet of rubbery texture, which seemed to underscore the whole mediocre experience this premium economy flight had been. But it hadn't finished yet: On arrival at Heathrow, people in economy poured from their seats into our part of the aircraft before the seatbelt light had been turned off. No flight attendants told them to stay in their seats until those ahead of them had got off, not even a cabin announcement. Most cabin announcements during were barely audible, even in an aircraft as quiet as an A380, so that might not have made much of a difference. To sum up: we used to praise Singapore Airlines to the skies, but the scales have fallen from our eyes.This was an appalling way to start our holiday, and it will take a lot to get us to return to flying with this airline again."

For some reason they didn't do priority boarding parents traveling with infants which caused a bit of a bottleneck on the air bridge. Flight departed 10 min late but arrived 5 min early. Staff were friendly and the service constant throughout the flight. Having now flown Premium economy and Economy back to back I can't see the value in paying extra for Premium economy as the standard product is so good. Only downside was the time it took the luggage to come out.

Its virtually impossible to use my hundred of thousands KrisFlyer points for upgrades. The required ticket type is nearly the cost of the business fare in the first place!! Points have been progressivly devlaued with unecessary expiry dates. SQ is locked in the past. The budget airliens are beating it on service standards. There was a time when SQ was my preferred carrier. Sadly its no longer the case. The outdated one way vs two way ticket cost differential means I use other airlines more and more frequently becuase I need the flexibility in rescheduling flights. SQ should look at Jetstar Asia if it wants to see what modern customer standards are like. (Believe me I never thought I would write in favour of Jetstar.)

I will never fly with this airline again. My wife and I booked two seats from Madrid to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. We had a big drama at the airport in Munich because 20 min before departure their ground crew decided to asked us for a return flight from Vietnam. We had the approval letter from the Vietnamese Immigration letter which was shown to them. The only requirement is to have the approval letter and pay for the visa on arrival. This information was co-overrated by the Immigration department in Vietnam upon our arrival to HCMC. It is also important to note that this wasn't our first time in Vietnam and no airline staff has ever asked us for an outgoing flight. What really makes me angry though is that their ground crew left it to the very last minute to ask us for the return flight. It was an incredibly stressful booking a flight on the spot, only having 10 minutes or so to do it. We almost missed our flight because of their incompetence. To make matters worse the cabin crew was incredibly rude and unpleasant. One of the staff members didn't even bother to use the word please. How can these people work in the travel/tourism industry? On arrival to Vietnam, we found out that both of our suitcases were damaged. The airline did replace them however we had to go through the drama of filling out forms/taking photos at the airport after a very long flight. "

IFE was not the latest generation but the screen size was big enough and the selection of movies was more than adequate. The only downside was food, where Singapore Airlines normally does not shine.

The only downside is that on a 2am departure the only food offered as a meal is a cheese roll! Not what you want at that time of the day after hanging around at the airport and next meal in 8 hrs time. Other than that it was a great flight and the crew were excellent."

I was also told that from Aug 2017 the Boeing 777-300ER will be completely replaced by the A350. Only downside the hand controller stopped working to had to reach the bulkhead to change channels. As a full reset would cause issues for the row behind me and take 10 min I wasn't bothered, the staff said they would do it as soon as the others fell asleep. To their credit 6 hours later once the other dosed off the reset was done. Great flight, they will always be on the top of my list of carriers to fly."

I have been flying with Singapore Airlines in Economy a couple of times in the past and was under the impression that I really like flying with them. However, my recent two legs felt mediocre at best and made me question my general stance. The crews seemed disorganized, very mechanic, and provided slightly chaotic and/or unnecessary stressed meal services. The first beverage service consisted of pre-filled cups with wine and beer served from a tray that the FA carried through the aisle. Kinda strange. Why not hand out little wine bottles (as Lufthansa does) and cans of beers instead? If no one takes the cups, do they pour them out? The planes were fairly old, featuring ancient inflight systems. I also dislike with Singapore Airlines that during online set selection, one is only being shown very few available seats - and when you sit down, the seats that were shown occupied suddenly are empty, while the one next to you which was shown available is occupier. I understand that there always are last minute changes but I still notice a repeating pattern; with other airlines (within Star Alliance) I usually am able to make smarter seat choices than when flying with SIA. The food was good. Overall, if Singapore Airline wants to maintain its position as a serious premium airline, it has to improve the overall pleasantness of the flight experience. The fare was not cheap (yet the booking class made it hard to earn miles outside of Krisflyer), and mediocre doesn't justify a significant higher price than what the low cost competion offers."

In general, Singapore Airlines was good, however, their service seems to be going downhill.  Dining experience was slow - the cabin crew on the other section of economy cabin even had finished their service completely while the cabin crew on my section had just finished halfway. Another thing was there was no consistency since the crew started from wrong direction. Usually they start their way form the front to the back but this time one section within the economy cabin started from the front and the other from the back. By the time they have reached my seat, they said there was no more choices so I had to take what was left. Furthermore, on the meal tray itself, my salad or appetiser food container had no cover. Since the crew on my section was so slow; therefore, they expected us to finish our meal so fast so they could clear up. I have traveled with them a lot and I have been in business class. I didn't compare it with business but this was the first time in my flight with them in economy that the service was slow, ran out of choices, no food cover, non-focused cabin crew, etc.  I hope they can improve before it goes down to far and losing their loyal customers further"

✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Brisbane via Singapore ,April 2017,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Hong Kong to Brisbane via Singapore with Singapore Airline. It is a disappointing travel experience. The flight from Hong to Singapore (SQ871) was delayed about 30 minutes and therefore arrived Singapore 10 minutes later than scheduled. Yet my next flight from Singapore to Brisbane (SQ255) was going to depart in about 40 minutes. It was so a rush to transfer flight in such short period of time. A better arrangement would be appreciated as this pattern happens daily. As soon as I landed in Singapore, the staff informed me that my luggage could not get on the same flight as mine because of the time constraint and that I had to make a report after landing in Brisbane. However, no further detail was given and I was not sure where and who to talk to. The flight from Singapore to Brisbane is about 8 hours which would give their staff plenty of time to communicate between Singapore and Brisbane offices about my luggage. When I landed in Brisbane, I was directed to the office after asking a flight attendant and then the counter staff at departure. I would appreciate if I was given a better instruction in Singapore (or at least before landing) so that I would not need to run around in the airport. I told the lady at the office about my situation and showed her my flight tickets and passport. However, she did not check anything about my luggage and kept giving me confusing information. She told me my luggage should be in the baggage claim and I had to wait at the airport for an uncertain amount of time since I went through custom already and could not go back in anymore. Then she said the staff had paged me at baggage claim but I did not respond. However, I did not hear any announcement in baggage claim. When I asked her whether my luggage was in Brisbane or Singapore, she was not sure. I would’ve appreciated if she could check for me before saying anything. I am not upset about my luggage not being able to get on my second flight but I'm deeply disappointed about the service and how the staff handled it. I will never take Singapore Airline or recommend to my family and friends."

We missed our connecting flight scheduled to depart at 19:00 from Jakarta to Singapore. Upon arrival in Jakarta we brought our case to Garuda customer service and it was promptly processed. There's no flight available for the day so we were put in hotel with dinner and breakfast voucher.

The airline fails to compare to the Middle East carriers such as Emirates. My Singapore to Mumbai journey was in an old 777 with a very uncomfortable seat that left me with a backache. The entertainment system on both the 777 and A380 were archaic and cumbersome to use. Definitely didn't feel worth the premium price that I paid for the ticket.

Beautiful seats with such comfort. Sufficient storage space. If you long for Singapore cuisine there is tons on board. Whilst I did not eat the crew reserved a banana for me before we landed. The SFO-HKG was uneventful as the crew were kind switched off the lights early allowing us to sleep.  The HKG-SIN sector departed on time and the HKG ground crew and lounge staff were very courteous attending to any questions I had about my allergies. The crew was quick to get us our drinks and meals and then we settled to do our work or watch a movie. My suggestion is that if the crew is aware that on board wifi is not available for the initial part of the HKG-SIN as apparently the networks are not that great. This will be very helpful.

This flight was in an older A340 that does not have flat bed seats. It is fine for a day time flight but having flown this at night previously is not good for a refreshing sleep. Check in was a bit slow and rude, being directed by one staff member to a check in agent who put up her hand to my face to indicate for me to stop while she did something else. Lounge was basic but all I wanted was a coffee. Flight left on time, brunch and snacks were both tasty, of a high quality and large in size. Quality of coffee on board was excellent, too. Crew were great and the wine was good. Attempted a couple of hours sleep which was not great due to the seat. Off the plane at the closest gate to immigration and through customs in 5 minutes and the bags were magically waiting to be picked up. All up a very enjoyable trip that would have been improved through travelling on a plane with the new long haul business class seats."
✅ Verified Review ,A350,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,San Francisco to Singapore,March 2017,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,3.0,4,yes,6,"  Flew roundtrip on Singapore Airlines new nonstop route between San Francisco and Singapore in Premium Economy on the outbound and regular Coach class upon returning. The premium seat was decent, but I wasn't as impressed with the rest of the setup or the soft product. With the hard partition toward business class in front, and the service area / galley located well to the rear past an economy section, the premium economy area on this aircraft is a virtual dead-end rarely patrolled by flight attendants. On the SFO-SIN sector, received two meals during the 16h20m flight, with no other proactive service - no separate drink runs prior to the meals either. You had to press the call button for anything, mid-flight snacks were available but again, nothing was offered voluntarily. Flight attendants seemed to do what was required but without a smile. No landing cards handed out. Except for the seat itself, the service on the return flight SIN-SFO in regular Economy was actually better, with a pre-lunch drinks run (from a tray, not a full cart) and follow-up hot beverage service after the meal. As with the outbound flight, however, the second meal service - a breakfast - took place about six hours before landing, what gives? The check-in experience at SFO was ok, but at SIN economy passengers are herded toward self check-in kiosks and self baggage tagging whether they like it or not. I have only flown SIA once before, but based on my limited experience with them so far, I wouldn't go out of my way to fly them - although I would chose them again if they offered a convenient schedule at a decent price point."

Checked in online and dropped bags. Friendly ground crew directed me to Business Class check in counter as the online check in counter was busy with another passenger. No issues and was issued boarding pass seamlessly. Boarding at Gate 61, a bit chaotic as there are very few seats in that part of the airport for all passengers on a full A380. Departure delayed one hour due to bad weather but was handled professionally by captain and was able to make my connection in SIN. Meal ok, but cabin crew seemed almost robotic, rehearsed and fake. Lacked human touch and could probably be replaced by a few well programmed robots. Seat 60K in economy. After sometime realized my back was aching. Discovered that seat had no lumbar support, some did, mine didn't and couldn't fully recline either. Not pleasant for a 7 hour flight to SIN. Didn't bother complaining as crew was nowhere to be found after meal service and were happy to switch off lights and disappear. Entertainment system, a bit dated, probably the original system used with the first A380 flights and some buttons required a harder press on the remote as had been worn out. Had about 200 movies but I mostly listen to music while flying. Choice of music was mediocre, so decided to use my iPod instead. No free WiFi quota. Same continued on SIN-CMB leg except seat had lumbar support this time, didn't turn on entertainment system this time. I think SQ is highly overrated and not a patch on Emirates or even some non 5 star airlines. Would consider others before SQ next time."

The service is great, a regular drink tray with waters and juices being brought to you to keep you hydrated. The food was decent for economy class standards and they also offered a small snack (sandwich) and second meal. A small amenity pack was provided and consisted of a toothbrush and socks - nothing special but still a tick in the box which some airlines have cut back on. The headrest of the seat is comfy and is made of leather which gives it class. Ambient lighting during the night hours gave a relaxed and upmarket feel. The best part of the Economy seat was the entertainment system which consisted of a large screen - bigger than an iPad size and then has a small digital control below; it all works well and is also touchscreen and the quality and size is better than I've seen on BA business 747. Overall the most comfy and best way to fly direct to Singapore from London in economy class but price will still dictate choices and whilst I'd pay a small Premium to fly Singapore again a harder discount from BA or Garuda would sway me."

What a shame that airline has no remorse to senior people. We are seating in toilet class row 56's. As seniors we make two or three trips a year however we haven't encountered this situation in our travelling time. Manager was not considerate or seriously shown any interest.

When I file a complaint to Customer service, and the response is that it is due to the luggage is wear and tear, Singapore Airlines could not submit the damage claim to the insurance company and that's it.

We usually fly BA premium economy, but this was part of a package and we upgraded the flight. We are in our 70's and cannot cope with economy over 13 hours To say we were disappointed would be an understatement. The only good thing is the seat but the service is very poor. Firstly if you ""Book the Cook "" a pre-ordered meal, it will be served long before anyone else. The promised champagne and drinks service did not materialise and staff did not curtain off the cabin from economy and were constantly moving through the cabin to serve economy passengers. This is an expensive airline with a lot of online hype about the premium economy service. We were allocated Row 31 which has extra legroom but as the seat plan shows it is right next to the galley and we were constantly disturbed throughout the whole flight. Under no circumstances would I use this cabin again - not a patch on BA"

I always fly Singapore Airlines as it offers the most direct flights out of Singapore. Flew on SQ241 on Feb 8th. SQ advises that all their SQ flights with B777-300ER and A350/380 has wi-fi. Unfortunately this flight has no WiFi despite it being a B777-300ER plus flying out at 0700 one would expect a little breakfast. Sadly there was no meals until 12 noon Singapore time which means about 3pm Sydney time. I overheard an American passenger asking for some food as he was hungry. I can understand that most of the passengers are doing a transit but there are many of us who are just starting our day and with a flight at 0700 there is not much time for breakfast. I would appreciate if SQ indicate clearly which flights have wifi and not a blanket statement about the aircraft.

Inflight entertainment is great as there are so many choices of movies or music to listen to. Singapore Airlines is a great airline and I would always consider flying with them. During seat sale, they offer fares that are even cheaper than low-cost carrier. With Singapore Airlines you have meals and free luggage allowance of up to 30 kgs."

Boarding at Changi is consistent and zone wise boarding. Check-in staff, passport and boarding card checks are very friendly. On boarding the flight crew looked less enthusiastic then I know of. There was a sense of disorganisation. The senior crew jetted through cabin with a frown and certainly created a negative environment. Once in the air, meal and drink service was conducted. I use book the cook service and was served about 30 mins before fellow passengers which I find bit awkward. Again, the meals can be elabotate for this class but I found portions are small and not filling. Service lacked enthusiasm, warmth and smile on both the sectors and cabin crew were indifferent. Some were good and some were kind of forced to work. SIA provides good entertainment system so while watching movies, I decided to get a snack from middle galley and crew were friendly but didn't see them throughout the flight atleast on my side of aisle. On one of the flight, I asked for a coffee and it was brewed very strong even by European standards with the reason given that Europeans only drink strong coffee. The crew in back galley were sad and angry. On the positive side, SIA 777-300 has spacious toilets. Entertainment system is good and seat is spacious enough for the class. All in all, MUC flights are out of Singapore Airlines pattern. I read review of another passenger in this forum also travelling to MUC and found to be negative. I have made some good experiences on thier other sectors and based on it, I do recommend Singapore Airlines. I hope SIA will rectify the crew issue on this segment and hear the plight in catering segment for Premium Economy on all segments."

✅ Verified Review ,A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to New York via Frankfurt,February 2017,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,4,yes,10,"  Singapore to New York via Frankfurt. I have flown the SIN-NYC route 4 times in the last 15 months. In my earlier trips, I flew with a large European carrier and two different Middle Eastern carriers. I last flown SQ on this route over 8 years ago so I can compare the recent experience with that from 8 years ago. The main thing to me that distinguished SQ service from competitors is cabin crew service. One thing which I felt was lacking though is the smiles that SQ's crew used to be famous for. Some of the more senior staff still has that touch and could make a positive impression but increasingly, I noticed in my last 8 or so flights on SQ in the past 12 months, that the crew are no longer as at ease or friendly as they used to be. A small minority seem a little indifferent which drags SQ reputation down. Their service adds a shine to the brand even though the hardware is not as impressive as the Middle Eastern carriers. A380 feels older compared with the B787s and A350s that many airlines are now using. Despite the older planes, I find the generous seat width a life saver. Other details include lights under the IFE screens which gave good coverage for each passenger's immediate area but do not disturb surrounding passengers. Another detail is the foot pedal activated trash bins in the toilets, helps not having to push the bin's lids using our hands. There was good crew presence throughout the entire flight. The food portion is generous and quality better than other carriers I have flown. I can't wait to experience the A350 on this route, and hopefully the cabin crew will be better trained and motivated."

We left DUS in time. The service followed with hot towel, drinks and nuts and meals. Using book the cook service means getting your meal before your fellow passengers. The meal was okay and we were offered three choices of warm bread and big selection of fancy drinks. After meals, they served ice cream but missed on me, where a crew assured that they are not offering it to me since I am vegetarian and ice cream contains gelatine. Since it was a day flight, crew was actively anticipating needs and were very busy serving to a group of very demanding passengers in economy. This flight had dedicated crew for Premium Economy and they came around at least 3 times to assure if everything is fine. Many rounds of snacks in a basket and drinks on tray and crew looked enthusiastic, service minded and very friendly. We were made to feel like welcomed guests. I walked to see economy class, the crew were happy to chat about A350 product.  The aircraft by itself is very quiet, quieter than B787 and toilets are spaciously planned and were kept clean. The air ventilation can be really felt and cabin design made me feel relaxed. The Captain announced turbulence, and crew walked through the cabin to ensure we have fastened seatbelts. Before landing, breakfast was served and immigration cards handed out. We landed in time and I left the aircraft as a happy passenger with a feeling that this was my best flight ever."

I've flown Singapore Airlines in Economy Class long haul several times and been satisfied. On this occasion I decided to opt for Premium Economy. I was flying from Auckland to London via Singapore but the first leg was on Air New Zealand, and I recommend their Premium Economy service. Singapore Airlines seats have a bit more space and legroom than Economy, and the in-flight entertainment screens are bigger, but otherwise everything was identical to Economy class. I'm a vegetarian and I had the exact same two meals I had in Economy class three weeks earlier, and I didn't enjoy them the first time around. My companion ordered the ""book the cook"" and his meals seemed better quality, but none of the available options were vegetarian. For the breakfast service they completely forgot to offer us a drink. The service was bored and impersonal throughout, the flight attendants were rushing around and didn't smile. The toilets are shared with Economy class. For sleeping I didn't find the seats significantly more comfortable than regular Economy and the fixed central console means you can't stretch out over any adjacent empty seats. That said I'm only 5'3"", my 6'1"" companion did appreciate the extra legroom. The entertainment selection is extensive and the noise cancelling headphones good. However, we were in the front bulkhead seats and the screens were set on the wall ahead of and were too high for comfortable viewing, there are also irritating advertisements ahead of each programme. All-in-all extremely disappointed, didn't feel I got value-for-money compared to regular Economy class. This experience has really put me off flying Singapore Airlines again."

Flight left on time and crew started working down one side of the Business Class cabin almost immediately, the other side took substantially longer. In any case the crew were helpful, the food was fine and the seat comfortable. Wine was good and topped up. A short stay in the lounge at Changi T3 and then re-boarded the same plane at the same gate (different flight number). Crew still fine but food was not up to scratch, the steak was very overcooked to the point of being really tough. The vegetables were mush, I didn't eat much and the crew member asked if I wanted anything else but I went to sleep instead. Supper coming into Brisbane was better. Waited 25 minutes for one bag in BNE, the other didn't arrive. Filled in the details at the airport. Have not heard back, no one answers the baggage service phone although you can leave a message that no one responds to as well. Calling Singapore Airlines they give you the number for Menzies Aviation that you have already called, they also mentioned that they would call back but have not. The online bag track system has had the same message on it for 6 days. In all the standard here is not commensurate with the full business class fare paid. The main advantage of the flights was being able to sleep, arriving on time is good but not when you are without your luggage and the follow up is so poor."

A recently renovated 777-300 was exceptionally comfortable and provided the basis for an excellent trip if only the crew had cared. All crew members were well presented as always but those serving my part of the cabin showed a low level of enthusiasm about their jobs. It started with a 40 minute wait for a glass of wine and water, there was a similar 40 minute wait for a coffee in the morning. Offered a regular meal as opposed to the special meal I had pre-ordered at both dinner and breakfast, indicated that they weren't paying much attention. Not called by name once, just ""sir"" with a half hearted apology at dinner re the offer of the initial meal and then when asked if I would like desert a pointed response to me when asking what it was, being told ""I have no idea, you ordered a special meal"". Dinner was very watery as I don't think that the water from the vegetables had been drained and so the gravy was more like a soup. Breakfast omelette was cold. After I asked for the regular cereal to be taken away, I think that they began heating the special meal I had ordered only at this point. When it was served 10 minutes later half of it was cold to the point of being refrigerated. Not offered water between meals, had to go to the galley each time. While not the fault of the airline, it was topped off by a nearly two hour wait at customs. There was no immigration officer at the ""crew only"" queue and the crew went through our queue so they were off long before the passengers. We were behind a very slow moving contingent of Air China passengers. By the time I got to the baggage so much time had elapsed our flight was no longer listed and had to go to the Lufthansa bag desk to find out which carousel to go to. Landed at about 6:00 am and was in a taxi at about 9:00 am, which is far too long. The slow processing on arrival in Munich reflected the poor quality of the whole experience.

✅ Verified Review ,Boeing 777,Business,Economy Class,Singapore to Jakarta,December 2016,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,3.0,1,no,1,"  Singapore to Jakarta return. I always had a good experience on Singapore Airlines, until December 4 and again December 8, 2016. I flew from Singapore to Jakarta and then back to Singapore. When I booked, I gave SIA my United Mileage Plus account number so I could get credit for the two short flights. I was told it was in my profile and even showed up on my two boarding passes for both flights. When a month went by and I did not see any credit in my UA Mileage Plus account for the two SIA flights, I contacted Mileage Plus to look into it. I was told by UA that I was not getting credit because my flights were in K class economy, and that was ineligible to get miles on United, even though SIA is a Star Alliance Partner. I then took my complaint to SIA who told me something I had never heard of ""when you book in K, V, Q or N Class you only get miles on SIA."" What? I flew on the plane, I paid for my ticket and SIA only gives miles for their Kris Flyer program? Lame, .stupid and unfair. Part of my flights to Singapore, part of my trip was on ANA and they gave me full mileage credit on UA Mileage Plus for the NRT-SIN leg. I will never fly Singapore Airlines again."
✅ Verified Review ,Boeing 777-300ER,Business,Premium Economy,FRA to SIN,March 2016,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,5.0,4,yes,8,"  Frankfurt to Singapore. Superb product! Right from boarding till reaching Changi. Boarding began in time and orderly, zone wise boarding which helped in quick boarding and we left within 25 minutes considering it was a fairly full flight. We were greeted by delightful and genuine crew. The aircraft was clean and business class is the best I have seen. Premium economy seats are very comfortable with lots of options to store gadgets, charging point, usb port and big hd screen with many options. As soon as we were airborne, hot towel service followed by snack and drink followed by meals. I used the cook the book service, passengers using such option are served first, this doesn't allow you to dine with your fellow passengers unless you wait. Usual meal service was hurried and crew seemed to be in stress as economy in back was completely booked out. The meal by itself was okay. For premium economy I would have expected to be elaborate. Trays were collected after a while and rolled down service. After some hours I tried thier snack service, crew delightfully greeted and opened snack options and gave me more than requested. Fresh fruits, sandwiches, chocolate waffles and crisps. The crew was also courteous enough to inquire if they could do anything so that I can sleep for a while. I also noticed that crew went through cabin couple of times to anticipate our needs. Although captain announced turbulence and turned on seatbelt sign, crew walked through cabin with torch to check seat belts and ensured we fasten it. They even fasten seat belts for passengers who were sleeping, never seen such care on another airline. Breakfast was served before landing and immigration cards were handed in time. At all times, crew were caring and meticulously dressed. I am very impressed by Singapore Airlines and thier product. Definately my first option to Asia. "

✅ Verified Review ,Boeing 777,Business,Economy Class,PER to MUC via SIN,February 2017,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2,no,1,"  Perth to Munich via Singapore. This is a review of the flight SQ328 from Singapore to Munich on 10th February. The ordeal started in Singapore. While the flight was not marked as delayed, the departure time had been pushed back by 35 minutes on the airport screens. When I inquired, the answer was that ""we are using the first available aircraft"". Nice indeed. Singapore Airlines obviously works under the premise that changing departure times because of missing aircraft does not mean a delay. The flight boarded in accordance with the displayed delayed departure time. However, once on board, nothing happened at the departure time. No announcements were made. After inquiring again, the captain condescended to make an announcement that he was waiting for other passengers to join the flight. When inquiring a 3rd time what additional time we would be looking at, I got told that the captain is unable to tell. After an estimated 15 additional passengers had come in during additional 45 minutes of waiting, the aircraft finally taxied out to the runway. However, while several other aircraft passed us and took off, we were sitting in a parking spot next to the runway. This time an announcement was made that we ""have a few aircraft ahead of us"" - after about 20 minutes, the captain told us that his flight plan had expired and the route to Munich had been closed because of the long time we waited for other passengers. The result was that we had to taxi back to the gate from which we had left, in order to get a new flight plan and refuel the aircraft. This exercise cost another hour. In summary, it may be justified to wait for connecting passengers from delayed flights. However, the captain should have communicated honestly and, in particular, never taxied out to the runway. It is unprofessional and proves utmost incompetence to do this without a robust flight plan. He could have easily obtained an adjusted flight plan while we were sitting at the gate waiting for the connecting passengers from delayed flights. His lack of planning and anticipation skills are very concerning from a passengers's view. What does the guy do if anything unforeseen happens in the air? To add to the picture, the aircraft was worn, old and super noisy. The service in the back of the cabin was slow and disappointing when compared to previous Singapore Airlines standards. This was the second encounter of disappointing Singapore Airlines service in four flights on my recent trip. Things seem to go south at Singapore Airlines. In general, I question the justification of SQ having a five star airline rating."

The outbound flight was excellent in terms of being on time, the inflight service was impeccable. The seafood that I normally order was very very good. The flight crew were friendly and helpful as I needed some help with ordering in flight duty free goods. On the return from Chennai to Singapore, the service during the flight was bad. The cabin crew with their robotic attitude were interested to finish the service as soon as possible, to disappear from sight. Other than that I do not have any complaint to make."
✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Vientiane via Singapore,January 2017,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,no,3,"  Perth to Vientiane via Singapore. Beware the stopover with Singapore Airlines. My husband flew straight home from Laos but the rest of us - myself and our 3 teenagers - decided to stay in Singapore for 4 nights. I would have thought the national airline would be encouraging passengers to stay and spend money in their country. We were charged an extra $437.50 per person to do this. On emailing and phoning the airline on several occasions the explanation given was the flights were a different code. With further enquiry I was told that departure tax was part of the cost. This, when asked, amounted to about $30 each! So I won't be flying with Singapore Airlines again and suggest you check the cost of your tickets to see how much extra you will be paying to stayover"
✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,SYD to LHR via SIN,January 2017,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,5.0,1,yes,5,"  Sydney to London Heathrow via Singapore. I normally fly China Southern business class from Sydney to London and I pay for the tickets myself as I fly to the UK to see my parents and family. This year my father turns 90 in February so I am flying to London twice this year and in order to save $2000 I decided that one flight had to be an economy one. Not being able to face true economy I booked a Premium economy seat with Singapore Airlines. I have flown Premium economy with other airlines over the years, Qantas, BA and Virgin Atlantic (when they still flew to Oz). Firstly having booked the ticket with an online travel agent I went on to the Singapore Airlines internet site and was able to select my seat and Book the Chef meals. 10 out of 10 for their on-line presence, easy to use compared with China Southern which is a nightmare. At the airport no queue for the dedicated Premium economy checkin. Staff member very polite. No lounge access but Sydney Airport has plenty of places to sit comfortably and is not too busy. Boarding was a breeze as Premium economy have priority with Business and First. On the plane the FAs were all smiles and assisted passengers with their luggage and that's something I haven't seen for a while. Boarding was swift on both sectors, the captains introduced themselves and we left on time. Soon after the seat belt sign went off the drinks were served. I prefer being given a minature gin and can of tonic rather than just being served it in a glass. Also no slice of lemon. The meal service came next all served on one tray. The quality of the food was good, but very small and no different from economy. Throughout the flight FAs came around with water and if a passenger wanted a drink or snack they were provided. The FAs were always polite and friendly and came when requested. I never drink much alcohol when flying so the water was adequate. we arrived early on both sectors, disembarkation was quick. My flight cost A$3100 return, an economy ticket on the same flights A$1300, a China Southern Business Class ticket A$4800 if booked at the same time. So there is the rub was it worth it. Well yes and no. The seat is more comfortable, even with the seat in front fuly reclined I still had space, the screen is large and clear and the available entertainment exhaustive. The problem arises when the Singapore Airlines product is compared to the likes of Qantas, it just doen't feel special. There are no seperate toilets, the food is the same as economy, during the flight the curtain between Premium economy and economy is not even closed. In other words all you are buying is a bigger seat with more space, an ecomomy plus rather than a Premium Economy and is that worth the extra A$1800. I don't think so. If I could have my time again I think I would either spend the extra A$1700 and fly business with China Southern or have stopped over on each direction with $1800 to spend on hotels and entertainment."

PTVs are not the latest ones, no touchscreen but good picture quality. Good service, but cost cutting measures were too apparent. SIA used to gorgeously serve meals to economy passengers. Now, the big meal tray comes with only one small box of mains, another super tiny box of salad, one piece of cold bread and that's it. They also need to increase speed of in flight meal. Learn from other airlines such as United and Air China. They are super 'meh' airline companies but their speed of conducting meal service is admirable."

It's been nearly 5 years since I last flew SIA and although just a single flight so far, I was bitterly disappointed. A380 business class section was looking a bit tired, seats worn and not the standards I remember. The biggest shock was how poor the cabin staff service was, almost from start to finish. Yes, they got the service done, but there wasn't a single smile or sign of expected service courtesy, they appeared bored and wanting to finish as quickly as they could. I fly a lot of other airlines around Asia, and whilst many of them have gotten much better in recent times, things seem to have gone the other way for SIA. Have the return flight next week and will update after that."
✅ Verified Review ,Boeing 777-200,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Copenhagen,January 2017,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,4.0,3,no,6,  Singapore to Copenhagen. I usually fly this route with Singapore Airlines and have found my satisfaction declining with their offer lately. There was over a one and a half hour delay to our departure with no apology from the captain or crew when we landed in Copenhagen. There was quite some turbulence on this flight and the plane appeared to be struck by lightning at one point which was also not commented on by the captain despite many passengers being visibly shaken by the experience. The Boeing 777-200 had an old interior with the entertainment system not working on my seat nor those of my two companions. The interiors of these planes are simply not up to standard for a 5-star airline and are well overdue for their scheduled upgrade. The crew were courteous and attentive and regularly came through the cabin with refreshments.

This was my first time on SQ and was quite excited about the journey as I had heard a lot about them. General: All my flights were on-time infact some arriving a bit earlier. The seat allocation in manage booking was restrictive when compared to competitors. I wanted to allocate a window seat and it was showing as all the seats were taken. Luckily when I checked-in, it showed one window seat on each sector and I was able to take it. Not sure why SQ should make it complicated. I do understand they have to block some seats to cater to their frequent flyers etc.. but that doesn't mean you block the whole flight. Value for money: The ticket prices are on the higher side compared to competitors. However, I am willing to pay for quality hence I would opt for SQ. Ground service: Ground staff in both Sydney and Singapore were friendly and the check-in process was smooth. Seat comfort: The seats were spacious. Though I am average sized I felt even a bigger person would be able to sit comfortably. Cabin staff service: Cabin crew are one of the friendliest in the world. Prompt service. My only disappointment was when a request was made for some additional alcoholic drink (within usual limits in a competitor), I got a feeling that the crew were not enthusiastic. I am not sure whether this is due to the airline policy or it was the cabin crew's perspective. Also when you request a spirit, its taken like a special order which will come after a while. Ideally they are supposed to have it along with the other drinks (like other competitors do) and should be served instantly. Food & beverages: The quality of food was excellent. The quantity could be a bit more but I will live with it. Inflight entertainment: One of their weakest points. In this current era of touch screens, we have to use remote control on both their A380 and A330-300 fleet. Also the choice of movies are very limited, a cheap take-away earphone and outdated software. I wouldn't mind if they provide a better headset and collect it at the end of the flight. I have read that their retrofitted B777-300ER and A350-900 come with touch screens. But that doesn't help anyone as A380 and A330-300 still forms a bulk of their fleet and are deployed on key routes. As an aviation enthusiast I used to enjoy the onboard camera with a competitor, unfortunately its not available on SQ. Cabin Wifi: The rates are really expensive when compared to some of the competitors. It didn't also work for a good part of the journey. I am aware there are restricted zones but I have flown on the similar route with another competitor and haven't had much issues with the Wifi. Overall, I would fly Singapore Airlines again and hopefully some of the above issues may be resolved with more A350's being delivered."

This time I arrived last night and my baggage never appeared on the carousel. I went to report it missing to be told that I didn't check in any baggage. I flew with two fellow workers who verified that I did (not sure why they didn't believe me) and I left my details. After numerous calls in the morning, I was told my baggage had turned up on another carousel at T3, and they would call me when it was being delivered. That was early this morning, it is now 4.30pm and I cannot get though to the ""hot line"" to check if they could give me an approximate time, no joy there either.

Our airplane had a technical issue on the Moscow to Singapore (A350 SQ361) leg. Passengers were kept inside of the airplane for 6 hours while the plane remained on the ground in Moscow airport. SQ did not arrange return of passengers back to the terminal. Neither hot meal was served onboard only a pack of chips within 6 hours. Crew provided little and infrequent information. Some passengers panicked and disembarked. We missed our connecting flight to Sydney and had to spend an extra 9 hours waiting for the next flight. As a result of the delay I was supposed to go to work straight from the airport after 38 hours of the prolonged journey. The airline asked me to write a detailed letter describing what happened.

In Bangkok, the staff hold up clear signs indicating doors to use by premium passengers and economy passengers. The A330 was quite new and comfortable. The screen for the IFE is large and has plenty of movies and programmes available. Two options were available for meals and in both journeys, I got my choice of meal despite sitting in the last row. I opted for the red chicken curry for the outgoing flight and stir fried pork with fried rice for the return flight. Both delicious and portions adequate. Although the seats were in the last row, they were able to recline with some room to spare before hitting the wall. The toilets were near the last row of seats but they were positioned further back, toward the galley area. Cabin crew worked hard on this 2 hour flight with hot towels given at the beginning of the flight and a meal service with coffee/tea run after the meal. One thing useful is the foot pedal that is attached to the toilet trashbins. This is a feature I have not seen on some new planes of other airlines. Toilets were well stocked."

I am overjoyed that Singapore Airlines has reinstated the lager B777-200ER on this route especially in Business Class as it provides a 1-2-1 layout, with the long haul business class product rather than the 2-2-2 regional layout. The crew was very attentive and welcoming, taking meal orders before take off. Food was excellent as were drinks.On the overnight flight you have the choice of either a meal after take off or before landing. I choose mine after take off wanting to sleep. I was awake for breakfast and was offered the continental breakfast. The IFE on this plane is a little bit older as is most notciable on the flight path screen and the old remote, but still an excellent selection.

Singapore Airlines new route Singapore - Canberra - Wellington - Canberra - Singapore. Flights to and from Singapore are overnight flights departing 23.00 from Singapore and midnight from Canberra to Singapore. Old plane but has 34 inch pitch in economy, heaven compared to other airlines 31-32 inches. Seats are quite firm but a good 19 inches wide. In both directions the meal is only a snack with a drink after takeoff, served really quickly to be able to turn the lights off. Extra drinks only on request. This allows Wellington passengers to get some sleep as they have already had a 3 hour flight to Canberra and a 1 hour transit. Breakfast is generous served with coffee and tea refills. The other bonus for this flight for Canberra residents is not having to get to Sydney or Melbourne and not having to deal with Sydney airport. For many Canberra residents it is only a fifteen minute drive to Canberra airport, check in is fast as it is the only flight out. With internet check in it is a bag drop. You can leave home two hours before take off and be in the departure lounge with time for a drink before boarding."

After booking the flight I received an offer to upgrade to Premium Economy, but I rejected after reading a number of reviews. The flight was departing behind schedule due to passengers who did not turn up and a time consuming de-icing process. I am glad I did not take the Premium Economy upgrade offer. Walking through the Premium Economy section during boarding I did not experience much added value by looking at the hard product, compared to Y. The seats look pretty narrow as well and not that much pitch. The business seats look great though. The Economy product is very nice in my opinion. Seats are maybe a little bit narrower than in the Boeing 777-300, but the pitch was good (I am 1.80m tall, enough space), decent recline and a huge entertainment touch screen which was awesome. The cabin felt spacious because of the high ceilings. Also higher humidity. Great aircraft! I was very dissapointed in the cabin noise level.  Yes, take off was less noisy but not during the flight itself. I think it will be less noisy in front of the aircraft but not sure about that. Customer service was good (not exceptional) and the meals were delicious.  One of the best meals ever had on a plane. I appreciate the metal cutlery and hot towel cloths. Overall, it was a great flight and I am looking forward to the next one! And I made my connection flight (which was very tight) thanks to the very efficient airport of Changi."

Even though other FAs in this flight to Houston were also polite, courteous and helpful as expected, but most of them were not as personable and does not exude a warm personality in giving their service. Most of the FA on this flight tends to give mechanical service and you can feel that they are here to perform as expected, but missing the part where they should be able to engage their customers in a more personal way. However they did a great job in providing their services throughout the flight, keeping us full with three meal services and drink-snacks in between, also keeping the restrooms clean and well-stocked.

Cabin Service was great, the FAs did quick hot towel, drinks and dinner service right after take off, and they also provided a birthday cake for my son as was requested. Good communication from the flight deck when there was turbulence coming up so everybody's prepared. Afterwards they dimmed the cabin lights so passengers can rest. FAs worked hard; they kept patrolling the cabin with water and juice runs every 15-30 minutes or so throughout the night, and occasional snack runs too (sandwiches, chocolate, fruits). Had breakfast before we landed, and arrived at Manchester ahead of schedule. Manchester to Singapore flight left behind schedule but they catch up and arrived on time in Singapore. Fresh set of crew from Manchester provided excellent service; the FA offered three meal services throughout the 13 hours flight (Breakfast, Lunch and light Supper) plus snack and drinks in between. We're kept full at all times with good food choices. Leading FA engaged me to ensure that my son had had his birthday cake as requested, even offering another one for this leg, which we politely refused (his birthday was already over!). Good communication from flight deck regarding arriving terminal and local weather. Cabin crew on both legs ensure that the restrooms were always cleaned and in pristine condition. Entertainment system was easy to use, a slightly older version without touch screen, and even though it may not have an obscenely extensive entertainment choice like Emirates, they have a large collection of movies and TV series including new releases that is more than enough to keep you entertained throughout both legs. Overall an excellent flight.

Have always Singapre Airlines with high regard until my most recent trip to London. When we booked in January 2015, we could not book premium economy on the MEL to SIN leg, as at that time there was no premium economy on this leg. This has now changed but only on some flights. MEL to SIN in Economy, an older plane with inflight entertainment screen to boot. The screen was awful, so if you flying on another SIA flight, hold back and watch the movies you want to watch on a better screen. Service was very average, IFE was poor, food was very poor. Singapore to London in Premium Economy The only advantage in taking premium economy is the seat pitch and thats it. This is a very poor attempt at premium economy and it is a complete rip off. Inflight entertainment was poor, a much larger screen, so great for movies, the only plus. My small hand held control panel did not work. The entertainment system kept resetting itself at the end of every movie or programme. One ear in the headphones did not work. Service was poor - In premium economy you are placed in front of economy and behind business class. The service is provided by the economy cabin staff. Could not call for service as my hand held control panel did not work. The toilets are down in economy, none near premium economy. Food was very Poor -  Economy class food. The only reason why I've given a score of 2 is because they have the book the cook service, but that is still economy class standard food. Remember, you are paying double the price for this seat. Flight arrived 25 minutes late. Return legs London to Singapore in premium economy was exactly the same but this time the entertainment system kept resetting itself, the headphones worked and so did the hand held control panel. Singapore to Melbourne in Economy - the breakfast on economy is as poor as you get with airline food. A cold bread roll, hard cold butter, cold muffin, cold unripe fruit.  The TV screen on this plane was up to date but still had issues with it freezing. We had a seat between us, so basically it was the same as flying premium economy but without paying twice the price. I had made a complaint to SQ a month before flying and this complaint has not been responded to. On all counts SQ have really dropped the ball. I would not recommend Singapore Airlines, especially if you are looking to fly premium economy."

A good experience on Singapore Airlines with a few hiccups. We got the middle seat to ourselves in economy which made the 16.5 hour journey quite pleasant. The nicest part of this flight is the actual aircraft. The A350 makes such non stop flights easy on the body. A plus for Singapore Airlines for including this in their fleet. Service standards are good, but quite often I feel that SQ have a pretty rushed and least patient service on the San Francisco route. The cabin was overall clean but there was some muck above my window which I had to clean. Biggest disappointment was when I asked for the Singapore immigration card and the crew member told me they hadn't brought any on the flight. 2 hours later another crew member started offering them. An apology for the error was not forthcoming which was the actual annoyance."

Despite booking some months in advance, they neglected to allocate us any seats together and our party of 4 was distributed throughout the cabin. The seat configuration is 2-4-2 and there are no toilets specifically for Premium Economy. Rather than a separate cabin curtained off, Premium Economy is just the front section of the economy section. The seats were functional and inflight entertainment good but seat pitch is less than Air NZ. The food was terrible. We used the ""book the cook"" option on the return flight and this was no better, though they did manage to accomodate an allergy in our group. The staff were unfriendly and snacks on the 14 hour flight (2 meals were offered, the second 6 hours before arrival) had to be requested via the call button.

If you book on line make sure to read all 20 pages of the Terms and Conditions. I have been an Elite Gold KrisFlyer member for 15 years and have previously considered Singapore Airlines as one of my preferred airlines. Not any more. All I wanted to do was buy an Economy Class ticket and use points to upgrade to business class (my daughter was the passenger). So I went on line and selected the cabin class that allowed upgrades. The web site showed a tick that this was possible and the ticket that I subsequently purchased likewise confirmed that class E tickets are eligible for upgrades. What they don't tell you is that upgrades are only permissible to the next available cabin class and that as most international flights have a Premium Economy cabin you can not upgrade from regular economy to business class. This little known rule is buried deep in the terms and conditions (section F, para 24, sub section a)) which almost nobody ever reads, it is 20+ pages long. And if you want your money back then there is a $200 cancellation fee. I have cut up my Elite Gold card and will never fly with Singapore Airlines again."

Days after making the reservation well in advance (through Orbitz), I was notified of a minor change in schedule. No problem. A couple of days later I received another change, this one a 22 hour flight delay requiring almost a full extra day of travel spent in Singapore. Singapore Airlines policy gave me these choices: Accept the change (ridiculous), or provide them with 3 alternatives in order of preference. They then choose which one you will fly. The passenger cannot choose and have that choice confirmed. Or cancel the ticket (full refund) and start over. In this case, no other same-day flight Singapore to Chiang Mai was available, so the alternatives reduced to an extra connecting flight through Bangkok, losing 2 hours, or extra connecting flight through Bangkok, losing 4 hours, or connection through Hong Kong and losing approximately 15 hours in transit. But if you say okay to these choices ""you could end up with any one of them"", and all are inferior to the original reservation. I cancelled, and will not be booking this airline again. This magnitude of change is inexcusable and the subsequent policy absurd."

Exceptional, but not in a good way. Missed connecting flight to Jakarta due to afternoon typhoon in Singapore.

Same issue happened once due to technical problem, but apparently SIA always tries their best not to compensate me with business class seats, even though I missed my flight because of their problems and I have been their gold member for 4 years now. I was compensated only with another economy class seat and SGD 15 meal voucher that I can only redeem at limited number of food outlets at Changi airport, and most of them are too random (food not looking good at all). They have been also been doing this cost cutting in the economy class meals by not giving appetizers anymore. FAs never happy when I order some special drinks even though they are on the menu. If SIA wants to do some cost cutting or what not, they should have made it less obvious, especially to loyal customers, otherwise loyal customers will look for other cost-effective Star Alliance carriers. Their ticket price for the same route is a lot more expensive compared to some other Star Alliance such as ANA and Asiana Airlines."

Flew from Sydney to Colombo via Singapore. Although we were in economy the aircraft was clean, ground crew and cabin crew were friendly and attentive throughout and food and entertainment were fine. The seat on the return leg on the upper deck of the A380 was so comfortable I had to be woken for breakfast. It was on the return leg that this airline really impressed me. At Singapore there was a technical problem with the A380 slotted to fly us back to Sydney. We were advised immediately and reallocated to another gate where within an hour, the entire passenger list was boarded onto another A380 and we departed 1 hour late. Who has a 'spare' A380 with flight crew ready to go with passengers boarded in 60 minutes? They also made up the time and landed us in Sydney ahead of schedule by about 5 minutes. This is a very impressive performance and one that some other airlines might seek to emulate. We flew Air New Zealand to San Francisco in May and a technical fault in Sydney saw us trapped in the airport for 8 hours, miss our connection in Auckland and lose a day out of our trip. No-one should be blamed for technical problems but the rude and unprofessional manner in which ground staff at Sydney airport managed passenger enquiries was unparalleled in my 44 years of flying. We will never fly with Air New Zealand again. We will fly with Singapore Air."

There is a wide selection of movies that I had to make the tough choice of sleeping 40,000 feet in the air or watching the very nice movies with noise-cancelling headphones.

My outward flight was appalling. I am a deafblind traveller, the airline was advised of my condition and requirements by both my travel agent and my mother. On boarding the aircraft with my cane I was told where my seat was, and nothing else. I had no access to safety instructions or menus. No access to entertainment system, no knowledge of where toilets were and no access to help button. I did not know how my chair worked. I was completely ignored on the outbound flight. A complaint was made and I was advised my return flight I would be made comfortable, that I would have my needs taken into account. This was not the case, again the seating was not appropriate even though promised. Singapore Airlines did not fulfill their commitment to make ""reasonable adjustments"" to ensure my safety or comfort onboard their aircrafts. I could not see or hear as both main flights were night flights. I could not use the toilets as I wasn't told where they are. The crew outbound had no concern for my safety or comfort. I was denied access to all inflight entertainment and felt unable to leave my seat for 13 hours. This is totally unacceptable.

It was 24 hours from Melbourne to Amsterdam and I don't feel tired or washed out on arrival - had a good sleep on both legs. It's worth that little extra expense and Singapore Airport is the best to kill time in. The business class looked fabulous, but their premium economy didn't seem that impressive as I walked past it."

Departure airport was quiet that day due to industry-wide strike. Anticipating delay and congestion, somehow I checked-in and cleared custom in a breeze, which was quite a surprise. Orderly boarding accompanied by cabin crews repeated welcomes, no one has rushed and despite the rear cabin being full, it remained quiet throughout the journey. I had prepaid extra for the Preferred Seat 48A on-board the new A350 with almost unlimited leg room - there's no seat in-front, thus moving in or out of the seat without disturbing fellow passengers alone was worth paying extra for. However, the seat does come with its own design flaws. Once the PTV is pulled up, it physically creates a wall in between 48A and 48B, not only reducing 48B's already limited personal space, it also made plugging in USB charger an additional hassle. Furthermore, reduced seat width and immovable armrest are just another two trade-offs if extra leg room is preferred. Nevertheless, the amount of seat recline did appear adequately generous. The flight took about 7 hours, there were two meals served - one dinner and another light meal. The size and taste of its meals have noticeably deteriorated over the years, e.g., the size of the tray has been reduced significantly, just to name one. I found the IFE content rich and diverse, especially the music library - I enjoy listening to music while watching the moving-maps. I didn't use the WiFi, thus unable to comment. The flight attendants patrolled the cabin two to three times between meals with professional manner and meticulous grooming. All in all, this flight demonstrated Singapore Airlines high standard of service."

The food was delicious, I had diet-meals on all flights and they took great care of me. One minor thing: the toilets on the A350 look very small. From Singapore to Melbourne I sat at 37G. This was an older version of the B777-300ER, with an older inflight entertainment system and more important not enough legroom. My knees were stuck against the seat in front of me. Cabin crew good, food was excellent and the 6 hour flight was over in a blink. On the return flight in from Melbourne to Singapore I changed seats the day before and sat at a window seat. This B777-300ER looked more modern and the legspace was much more than on the way into Melbourne. Again a very pleasant flight with a pleasant cabin crew. Only the last hour we had a bumpy flight with thunderstorms above Indonesia and Singapore, but the crew and pilots did a good job. The flight to Amsterdam left much later because of bad weather at Singapore, for almost half the flight we had a very bumpy and tiring flight but staff stayed polite and kept their friendly faces.

Legroom was above average at 32 inches and much appreciated. The individual TV was very old and screen quality was poor. The cheap headphones meant that the sound was fuzzy and after 30 mins I gave up. This was the case on all 4 long haul flights. Very disappointing. Selection was average. Compared to Emirates or Turkish Airlines it was remarkably bad. Even the moving map was ancient. Needs massive improvement. Service was excellent through the flight. Crew very polite and proactive. Food / drinks were generally good. Asian dishes were excellent and they gave me a second hot meal on request. Icecream for dessert was fun. Snacks were also provided as were drinks between meals. Steel cutlery was appreciated. Hot towel service is excellent. Toilets were always kept clean with nice amenities. They were also larger than on other airlines. All in all, I was really looking forward to a 5 Star experience but the PTV really let me down.

During the first hour of my flight from Singapore to London I made my concerns known to the senior cabin steward. He made a mental note but did nothing to show any reparation for the poor service except that he admonished his junior staff for serving wine in clear plastic beakers as opposed to the glass beakers provided alongside the plastic foil-topped water on the food tray. He explained that Singapore Airlines were relatively new to offering Premium Economy class. No welcoming drink, no menu in seating area, alcoholic beverages served in plastic cups, meals of appallingly poor standard, coffee disgustingly bitter, wines of a poor standard. Apparently champagne was available but it was not offered to passengers and I only became aware of it after a chance conversation with cabin staff while waiting to use the bathroom. Singapore Airlines offers very little in terms of Premium service in its Premium Economy cabin service. "
✅ Verified Review ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SYD to HND via SIN,October 2016,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,4,no,5,"  I recently flew from Sydney to Tokyo via Singapore in economy class. This was my first time flying Singapore Airlines, and I had high expectations. I am tall, 6 foot 5 inches, so space is paramount for my flying experience to be comfortable. Sadly SQ lacks this. I had 4 different versions of the B777 on this trip, and I found the newer the aircraft, the less space there was between seats. Food was ok, and service was great. Cabins seemed unclean. If you're travelling in Economy, don't expect a great experience, as it seems SQ only cares for it top dollar paying business class passengers. Will stick to my usual choices of Qantas and Garuda Indonesia in the future."
✅ Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,JFK to FRA,October 2016,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4,yes,7,"  I had a delayed flight from Tampa (on JetBlue), scheduled initially at 4.30pm but delayed to 5.06pm in taking off at 5.35 pm to JFK with a connection flight to Frankfurt on Singapore Airlines at 8.55pm which I of course, missed by the time I got to the other Terminal and through security. I was stranded at JFK a bit after 9.00pm because at the counter at the gate was no one anymore and the tiny booth is only occupied a few hours at odd hours per day. So I called the 1-800 # on my booking confirmation and was told that they would put me on the very next flight at 8.55am, yes the person said am! But as all offices are closed now I will get a confirmation call once they open the next morning! Learned later that they are in San Francisco, 3 hours behind us. So I went back to the other Terminal to the help desk of JetBlue, which had the delayed plane - after more than an hour with several phone calls I finally got a room in an hotel for the night, I finally made it after midnight into my room. The next morning I rushed to the Airport only to learn that there is no am flight ! The flight is apparently daily at 8.55 pm. I couldn't believe what I was told on the phone. I already spent a short night without my luggage or personal belongings and fresh clothes and now I had to sit another 12 hours around. Once the booth from Singapore Airline was occupied at 2.55 pm I told them about my dilemma and he called his supervisor to find out if I could reschedule my flight back from FRA, Germany to JFK : instead of Oct. 03, 2016 to one or two days later because of my lost 24 hours here at the Airport. Nope, nothing to do, because I already have gotten an hotel room for the night ! Unbelievable, I would have slept in a corner at the Airport they would have rescheduled my flight back home?  I didn't even get to choose after this ordeal, really? It's a shame that the company is not more flexible or willing to do more for these kind of situations. I'm very disappointed how this was handled."

Wow there really is - I discovered - not a great deal of consistency with SQ apart from the service routine. HCMC to Singapore I had the best meal on a flight ever. Tender pork in gravy with thin sliced fried potato and onion. Was so good. The entertainment was appalling in that the screen was too dark to even see, even with lighting altered and the screen tilted, blinds down. Anyway we got there safely and being just a 2 hr flight it was fine. Leaving Singapore on SQ 227 at 9.20pm. Full flight. Going through security at the gate itself. Boarded in sections but no one abided by that and they were not enforced which makes for a shambles. Paid for exit row seats. Nowhere to store anything. My husband tried to find an overhead locker but the lady in the aisle two seats down refused to share. Her carry on was horizontal in it and she had another small bag. Got upset when my husband tried to put her bag vertical. Was ignored by FAs. Found somewhere finally, but if you do go for the exit row you will be last off as you can't get back to where your bag is. Nowhere for my handbag. I got it stuffed under my own seat via the front. There was a baby in the infant seats but was really good, very attentive parents, I was impressed. Singapore has got the meal service wrong here too. At 9.20pm you are faced with a proper dinner which a snack would suffice as most have had dinner by then. Breakfast was a roll, muffin and a little bit of fruit. After having such a great experience on the initial trip I felt let down. Still quite good but I felt I could have been with any other airline. I wish there was more consistency. I would still opt for them though at least outbound."

The 2013 version of business class is quite an improvement on the 2006. The seat was as roomy and still the class leader, but now it is more flexible: it has more options for reclined seating without going into the full bed routine. Blankets, pillows, etc, are top quality, though no amenities pack as usual with Singapore Airlines, but there's stuff in the nice bathrooms. New 18"" screen was fantastic, though I find the range of watching and listening on Singapore Airlines somehow terribly middle of the road and safe. Food and wine with lots of choices and all very good, well plated and thought out. The FAs were responsive and worked hard, they saw issues without being told and dealt with them gracefully. But they were chilly and somehow robotic. Engagement was not on the agenda; it rarely is on Singapore Airlines unless you are in First/Suites. On time, spotless, efficient, and careful with premium passengers."

Chose two seats together, there are not a lot of these, but they were great. You expect very little in economy these days as most airlines have made economy a miserable experience for passengers. Singapore Airlines still treats economy passengers with respect and I was so impressed. We boarded in sections in Melbourne, it was monitored carefully with some held back as they tried to ""skip the queue"" as some always do. Left a little late but not by much. the hot towels before you leave and just before you arrive are a nice touch most airlines have stopped. The seat was wider than most economy. We got a refreshing drink and peanuts shortly after takeoff. Two hours in was a meal. I chose non seafood so my seat was stickered accordingly, I had a fantastic lunch. Quality tender chicken breast in a lovely light soy gravy with perfectly cooked vegetables, hot crispy bread roll, crackers, cheese, water, dessert and real cutlery, Drinks though didn't come out until everyone else got their lunch and I did sit with my tray there till everyone else was done too. No big deal. Entertainment was probably the only thing that they fall down on with not the greatest sound quality. Had a nap after lunch, then a mushroom and chicken pie before landing, All in all the Melb-Singapore flight was pretty well near perfect and we even landed half hour early. Singapore to Hanoi was on an older plane again. Seats had some marks in them, pocket torn and window very scratched. The service was good still, but not quite as good as on the ex Melb flight. The entertainment system again not the greatest but watchable. The food too, another lunch seemed to be lacking both in quality and quantity but was still pretty good. All in all, I thought for economy flights, Singapore provides a better experience than I have had in years. "

Very helpful and friendly ground staff at HKG. Flight to SIN was delayed by approx 30 mins due to conditions along flight path. Very new and comfortable cabin on B777, with extremely large entertainment screen and glass panel controller. Delicious food as well as generous refills for drinks/alcohol. Scheduled transfer time was 50 minutes, but as plane was delayed, actual transfer time was just 35 mins. But arrival gate and departure gates are right next to each other, plus security checks are performed right at the gate, minimising greatly transfer time and effort. Therefore transfer was extremely smooth with much time to spare. SQ's A380 cabin was worn out, old and narrower seats with slow-reacting entertainment system. One of the only two toilets for economy on the upper deck was not working and closed, which was extremely disappointing as queues for toilet can be as long as 15-20 mins depending on luck. Upon arrival at LHR, disembarking was slow and walk to immigration from gate was extremely long, which was very tiring after a 13 hours flight. Quick immigration and baggage reclaim."

When I told her that I had requested an aisle seat of the back of my group, she rejected with an unsmiling face and said there was no choice of seats for group travel.

SQ222 to SIN departed on time, arrived 1 hour early giving us more time in transit to relax before the next sector to Moscow. SQ222 was a pleasant flight, friendly and attentive cabin crew. The next leg to Moscow, whilst sitting in aircraft waiting to taxi for takeoff, a senior cabin crew member approached us advising that our entertainment systems were not working in our seats and politely invited us to sit a few seats forward in exit row seats. Needless to say, we jumped at the opportunity. Pre-dinner drinks were served quickly as was the tasty supper. Breakfast was also wholesome and filling. Had a most comfortable and pleasant flight and was able to get a valuable 5 hours sleep thanks to the exit seat legroom. Enjoyed chatting with the personable cabin crew in the galley also throughout the flight who were approachable, professional, warm and informative – particularly about Moscow and their experiences. On this sector SIN/DME, the staff were most attentive. Arrived in Moscow refreshed after what was a total of 18 hours flying time. This was one of the best flights I have had for a long time – with all carriers – as I could not fault this flight. Return DME to SIN SQ61 also lucked out with exit row seats after I requested them on board – when I saw they were vacant and this once again help make the overnight flight to SIN very pleasant and quick. Meals from Russia were tasty. Departed on time arrived early. The last sector on the A380 again departed early and arrived early. Another overnight flight with the usual high standard service with a smile, attentive crew throughout, comfortable seats and superior airline food. Toilets were kept clean on all flights. Of note was that Singapore Airlines seems to have mastered the most suitable, comfortable cabin temperature for their red eye flights compared to other airlines where it can be extremely chilly."

Original A380 but was swapped out for a Boeing 777, so a little disappointed. My last experience with them was on a Boeing 747 (wasn't great then), and their service has improved considerably since. Check in was friendly and fuss free, and got along my way really quick. The IFE is rather dated but the selection was rich. Cabin interior was cosy and comfortable despite the age of the aircraft, making itself rather distinguishable from their sister budget air Scoot. The most memorable part was the food, which is a portion rather worthy of premium economy or even business class of other airlines. Return to Singapore an A330 looked newer and IFE was touch-screen. Cabin crew quickly served drinks and snacks after take-off, as there was slight delay on the ground. Separately they served the meal, and again they did not disappoint. Topped it off with a Hagen-Das ice-cream. The price was reasonably good as I booked early. If you are particular about having good food on board, this airline is certainly for you."

Today I’m sitting on a regular next gen biz class seat on SQ. I’m tall and with this seat if you’re sitting straight up (or slightly angled) you cannot stretch your legs straight ahead for you hit the seat in front. So to stretch out you have to sit sideways to put your feet in the allocated space. Thus, you also need to place a lot of cushions for back support so that you don’t feel the corner of the seat into which you’re leaning. Once you get into position it’s OK. But initially it feels uncomfortable for you’re sitting sideways. It also feels more extreme/tight compared to the older version of this seat. Given how many great new business class seats there are out there where you stretch out straight ahead, I think Singapore Airlines is soon going to have to change this seat configuration to stay on top. It is fine for medium-haul flights, but I think for the super long-haul flights it would become uncomfortable. A small detail that I love on these newly refurbished planes is the toilet seat handle. Such a simple feature that I’ve seen for years on the B747-800i but not on any other planes. With this small handle it’s so easy to lift the toilet seat up and so much more hygenic than the old way. The simple things!"

The interior of the cabin is definitely more stylish with a copper - silver - gray colour palette that exudes elegance. For a change I sat in the bulkhead, which is usually not my preferred seat. But with this new seat, I think that is the best spot for you can stretch your legs straight ahead and not sideways like with the other seats. The seat has lots more storage space which is always welcome, along with some new small touches that I liked. The on/off screen button on the seat control panel is great. A separate USB plug for charging. And there are some new seat settings as well, which are handy given that for the full flat bed position you still need to get up and put the back of the seat down. Which I don’t mind at all. As to the quality of the food and service, it was typical SQ. Excellent. On my return flight am not sitting at the bulkhead. Curious to see how that goes."

Would not recommend flying with Singapore Airlines if you are a musician who values their instruments. Never had any trouble with taking my guitar on other flights but as I went to book into my flight at Brisbane I was told that it was not company policy to let people take instruments on board and that I'd have to stow it under the plane. After a long discussion with the manager about how I've never had any trouble before and that it'd easily fit in an overhead onboard the aircraft she said to come back to the desk at around 9:30 when the crew would arrive, so I could ask them if I could be made an exception. I came back at 9 to be told that the crew had already arrived and said no so I would have to stow the instrument, I was then made to sign a form to waive my right to sue if the instrument was damaged before boarding the aircraft. I was assured by the staff that the guitar would be treated with the utmost care and I tried to put it to the back of my mind and enjoy the flight. Upon arriving back home I'm sad to see the wood on the head of the guitar has split and two of the tuning pegs have been damaged meaning my guitar which has traveled the world with me is now no more than an expensive ornament. What made me really dissapointed was being told there wouldn't be enough room on the aircraft for my guitar and then seeing 3 overhead compartments directly next to me free of any carry on luggage and plenty of seats free for it to have been stored. I know it's not Singapore Airlines policy to let people take instruments as carry on but I'm less than impressed about being lied to about not having enough room onboard and the fact that every other airline I've flown has had no problems with it. Apart from the guitar the flight was lovely, food amazing, staff were very friendly and the stewardess knew how to make a mean White Russian! Just wouldn't advise any musicians to take the risk and lose their beloved instrument."

The IFE has also been completely revamped with a great new remote system which is very intuitive and easy to use. Love that you can now quickly rate movies that you watch. The dining is amazing. As if I was sitting in a fine restaurant in town. I love ordering via Book the Cook for I can specifically choose my meals for every part of the flight. Excellent job SQ."

The recline chairs upholstered in the dated blueish-purple fabrics. I think Singapore Airlines has only three of these left. I hope SQ gets rid of these planes soon for it is completely inconsistent with their other excellent equipment."

SQ did not offer A380 business class seats for our travel dates from Delhi. Flight timings were convenient as the flight happened throughout the day bringing passengers into Bali via Singapore by late evening. The service was excellent, barring a negative moment on the SIN-DPS sector. Ground staff in New Delhi were kind to allow me to hand in a package to my driver which I was careless about. They collected it at the gate and made proper inquiries with me before agreeing to handover the envelope to my driver who came to collect it later. SilverKris Lounge in DEL was average in terms or service or offer and reflected the usual attributes of airlines offering mediocre service at Indian airports. Due to Indian regulations no champagne is served on boarding Business Class in India. Flight attendants were friendly and the business class product had no concerns. In-flight entertainment options aren't as large as Emirates, but had an eclectic selection of movies to select from. From SIN-DPS, we encountered a scenario which left a sour taste of the experience. The offered menu had an option of beef. Living in India good beef is hard to come across, so the plan was to indulge in beef on the way to DPS, since beef options were not available on the DEL-SIN sector. On requesting for a beef dish, I was advised that they had run out of beef and was offered the option of chicken or seafood. No apologies or offers to check if an economy meal was available. My partner chose not to have a meal since he wasn't keen on the seafood or the chicken. At this point three members of the cabin crew apologised profusely to him and assured him that they would do anything possible to make things better. At this point my partner asked the crew why the same apologies or service recovery efforts were not made with me, and the crew member simply mentioned, 'I'm sorry but we weren't aware that you were travelling together!' They tried to make up for the error by plying us with drinks and making multiple trips to the seat to inquire of our well-being. "

Very good overall, with the usual attentive and friendly service by cabin crew combined with, on this 2-year old plane, a very comfortable seat - helped by SIA only having 9-abreast seating on the Boeing 777-300ER. Seat back screen (Panasonic) was very generously sized and gave a clear picture, but the instructions were far from intuitive. Even with good headphones, film dialogue was often hard to follow, but after trawling through the buttons trying to select a sub-title option to compensate I gave up and called for cabin crew help. The steward took several minutes to find the magic button, but was himself too confused to explain how he'd found his way to it. That apart, the entertainment selection was extensive and even when the passenger in front reclined her seat the TV screen tilted enough to enable comfortable viewing. SIA still sets the standard for long-haul economy."

The aircraft was brand new and it all looked good and it was except for the attendants. I can't really put my finger on it other than it was impersonal, efficient but impersonal. They seemed to be in an awful rush to get us fed and watered and turn the lights off. You didn't see them after that at all and we were in premium economy on the way out. On the way back the flight left at 2am and after hanging around in the airport I was hoping for some good food. However it was not too be ! A sandwich was it !

The cabin crew was professional and working hard on this flight to get the meal service underway and completed despite the short flight duration. The seat felt a little cramped. The food was a slight disappointment and the service was less friendly or warm than what has to come to be expected of such a premium airline. Having said that, the crew was careful in ensuring that the pre-arrival checks are properly carried out (seat belts secured, etc) and that the safety of the passengers are paramount as should be the case."

I had researched Premium Economy with SIA. The flight on A380 tended to be more comfortable with more room. Boarding in Sydney was chaotic and confusing. The A350 seat to Amsterdam was very uncomfortable (front row) and the foot rest was redundant - I am 188 cm tall and this seat is not designed for my build by any means. Service was generally good but not up to the marketing hype. Only offered champagne once on each leg despite the way it is marketed and if I wanted more if was begrudgingly offered. Food (Book the Cook) was okay. Considering cost and advertising this as a premium cabin, there was no sense of privacy or a little bit more exclusivity because rarely, if ever, were dividing curtains or wall dividers closed. This was more for the convenience of FA who were moving between Premium and Economy with food trolleys, etc. Many Economy pax took the opportunity to wander through cabin, especially when nursing crying babies. Also, noise, especially many screaming babies were immediately behind my rear row seat in A380 flights - very noisy (even with noise cancelling headphones). Certainly there was more room and a little more comfort but at what cost - I don't feel it was anywhere near value for money. My biggest concern and complaint, which I made to FA, and even to SIA customer service, on CDG to SIN flight (July 15), was when parents left their two boys in Premium Economy while they took themselves off to Business class. They did check a few times but basically the two boys were left to their own devices. I had to stop them from damaging the lights, the window shutters, clambering over their seats, especially the young boy of 4-5 years. The FA cannot be expected to keep an eye on two young boys and neither should passengers. In this day and age, this is a big concern. Anything could have happened to the boys. What if there was an emergency - who would look after them? They became very restless and eventually I complained to FA but nothing was done. The parents were inconsiderate, selfish and irresponsible. Singapore Airlines were disrespectful of other paying pax. As a passenger, why should anyone's flight be disrupted and stressful due to others' selfishness as in this case? This is not about whatever class your in; airlines must stop parents from abandoning their children like this for everyone's sake. Also, if anything happened to the children, who is liable - the other passengers? the airline? Would I fly SIA Premium Economy again - I seriously doubt it. It has potential but if they don't deliver on their marketing promises, I will fly other airlines who do. Also it is disappointing that they cannot even respond to a written complaint. If you over-promise and under deliver consistently, you have dissatisfied customers. This was over 4 flights and I felt dissatisfied and disappointed overall."

First flight with Singapore Airlines and I was interested to see if travelling with Singapore would be substantially different to the experiences I had with AA/BA.  I flew economy but the service in economy with Singapore Airlines was equal to that in business class on AA. The Boeing 777 has a 3-3-3 layout so a bit more spacious for those in economy.

✅ Verified Review ,A380,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,SIN to MEL,July 2016,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,,2.0,1,no,4,"  Not so much (if at all) Premium. I flew with Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Melbourne (29/07/2016) in Premium Economy as part of a return trip to Colombo. This was my first time flying Premium Economy with Singapore Airlines, though I have flown it before with another large Asian carrier (which was a good experience). I usually fly economy with my partner for holidays and business class for work trips, so have some sense of the competition and product on offer. I'm also tall (194cm) and fairly broad which can make fitting into standard economy seats a squeeze. I had read a few reviews before the flight (all positive) about the new Premium Economy offering from Singapore Airlines and was interested to see for myself. The boarding at Changi was surprisingly disorganised and something of a circus. There was also some delays with take off which appeared to put the staff into such a fluster they forgot to give us menus or the standard amenity pack. The seats in Premium Economy look modern and fancy but are surprisingly uncomfortable for tall people. While they provide a bit more leg room and recline it is hard to make much use of this in a comfortable manner, and forget about getting much sleep. The foot rest offers nothing other than an annoyance and a reduction of leg room. The staff were (on the positive side) not rude but generally unhelpful, unfriendly, looked bored and appeared to go out of their way to not offer anything that might be perceived as an extra (eg. another glass of wine, a second cup of coffee, authentic hospitality etc). The main meal was very small and surprisingly un-tasty. The snack before landing was meant to be chicken fried rice but I struggled within the minuscule dish to find anything other than white rice and a couple of bits of carrot. The meals were so small and mean I was starving by the end of the 7.5 hour flight. The wine/champagne (if you're very lucky you can get one glass) they serve in a plastic tumbler (unlike the ad). The staff also have a habit of leaving you locked in with your empty meal tray for about an hour, which I can only imagine is a crowd control exercise. The entertainment system was good with a reasonable range of titles though annoying compulsory ads at the start of each viewing. It has an bad habit of switching itself on while you are trying to sleep as the controls are right where your knee pushes into the side of the seat. Overall, Singapore PE appeared to me to be a very average Economy with a slightly fancier looking seat, though not one that is well designed or practical for taller people. The service is anything but premium, in fact I've had better service in standard economy for a whole lot less dollars. My experience was nothing like the reviews I have read."

Out of MNL via a very, very old B772ER with the very, very old recliner seats with pull out screens in a 2-3-2 configuration. Singapore Airlines should retire or refit this plane soon. I don't think it's fair that they charge premium price for such an aged regional bird. Despite the trademark efficient, if not cold, SQ style service and tasty in-flight catering, very little can justify premium SQ pricing. The recliners are not a big issue on the short 3.5 hour flight and can actually be quite comfortable for a quick snooze after the meal service, but the screen is prone to glare, and my wife's screen was just malfunctioning the whole trip, making her experience not much different from a recent J class experience on a shorter MNL-HKG trip on PR with no IFE save for borrowed iPads. There wasn't the standard stowage space you'd expect from more modern J class products, but the toilets were clean and the amenities plentiful. So disappointed on this leg. Onward journey from SIN to DPS on a more modern A330 with angled-lie flat seats and a 15 inch seatback IFE AVOD system. Better product with more stowage areas. Service was half a degree warmer than the crew's from the MNL leg, but still a bit robotic for me. Got the nasi lemak via Book the Cook for breakfast and was quite a tasty offering. Less drink runs this time, but it's a shorter flight. All in all, an above average business class experience, but SQ needs to up its game a bit more for the price they charge."

They did the usual greeting when boarding, pre-flight drink and hot towel. Hot Towel is something not many airlines offer. Bangkok is not one of the country where you can book the cook, but the foods were not too bad with a Thai dessert on the tray. The cabin is clean even though this is relatively old plane. That might explain why the guy 2 rows in front of me also has the same problem with the IFE unit. Overall, it is an average experience.

Upon took-off all passengers who sat in business class asked the cabin crew to convert our seats to bed mode because it was an after midnight flight. We slept for about 5 hours and were woken up by the FA for breakfast, whereas our daughter was left sleep until half an hour before landing in Sydney. The meals were tasty and glasses were filled up frequently. FA were friendly, except one stewardess looked not so interested in serving us. We landed in Sydney only 20 minutes behind schedule. Inbound flight : Check in process went very fast and served by a friendly ground staff. Boarding was also on time.

That's S$40 off liquor if you buy in the airport Duty Free Shopping. Singapore Silverkris Lounge is great. I like the space and the food. Love the TWG Tea selection - Singapore Airlines really know how to pamper their passengers. We freshened ourselves up and had coffee and snack before time to board our connecting to BKK. This A333 was a old bird but still in working condition. The FA was really thoughtful to offer cold towel when my partner jokingly mentioned towel should be cold in the reallty warm cabin while she was giving out hot towel.

Aircraft was old and used my wet towel to clean the tray table and mess. No bar service - just a round of juice, beer and sparkling wine before the meal, which was a beyond belief. Hot casserole and bread and nothing else - not even salad or dessert. Asked the steward for bottle water and was told they only offered tank water.  I said I don't drink tank water and he brought me a small bottle from BC. Breakfast was a terrible meal too. On the return one round of Bar service provided this time.

,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,PER to ZRH via SIN,July 2016,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,5.0,3,no,3,"Perth to Zurich return via Singapore. I booked my flight through a flight partner (Virgin Australia) and before this trip I didn't know how flight partners worked, all it did was give me a headache. I wanted to book in my seats, normally you can do that online, however I was unable to do so either through Virgin's website nor through Singapore Airline's. I called Virgin and they told me I need to speak with Singapore. I called Singapore and requested seats. That worked fine. However on the flight over I didn't realise that sitting right at the back was so noisy, I wore earplugs the whole flight and could still hear the noise, but that was fine, I learned my lesson, but when breakfast came, I was the very last person to be served they ran out of the edible meals and the other meal was some kind of fish (which smelled too strong for a confined space). I normally am one to enjoy all kinds of basic airplane food and am really not fussy, but this was too much. Fish for breakfast? I actually was really unhappy because I never got a choice. Knowing all of this, I decided to change my flight home seat booking, so I wasn't the last person on the plane right down the back near all the noise. I emailed Singapore airlines with the request as soon as I landed. It took a couple weeks until they responded with a stock email saying I need to contact Virgin. I emailed back saying Virgin cannot do this as they dont have access to the seating plan, it is Singapore's job and I know as I have done it before. The email response that returned was the same stock email as they had sent again. This time I was really angry and re-iterated that they should please read the content of my email. Third time and I received the same exact response again. This was now 1 month after my original request (lucky I was away for 6 weeks). I had to find a way to call them while overseas (which was a who other headache) because this was not being resolved online. So I called them and had a very long difficult conversation trying to get the guy to help me as he really wasn't actually listening to what I needed and I was getting frustrated. He finally put in the request for me to get the seats changed and when I told him about the food last time he said he could also request a no seafood meal. So I thought great, I'll do that. On my flight home, the seats were all good but this time I discovered that requesting a non seafood meal means that they dont give you any option at all whatsoever, you just get the eggs, even when the meals being served are chicken or beef with no seafood options! When I asked if I get to choose the normal menu as it already is non seafood, I got an abrupt response about taking the meal from someone else. Gosh I had no idea about all this rubbish. So I learned a lot of things this flight. That Singapore Airlines have terrible online support and rubbish food and no matter what I did it didn't get better. I hear all these great things about Singapore Airlines and its probably fine if things are going ok for you but when they go wrong, they dont help you, not without a lot of effort and frustration any way. I will not be using them if I can help it, in the future. FYI I was going to make a complaint to them on their own site but after going through all I did with their online support last time I feel like its pointless and I am probably wasting my time as no one reads the emails (I can assume)."

In general, the boarding process and on-board service was very good, with most flight attendants being amiable and chatty. The food was good too, apart from a very ordinary entree leaving London. However, both flights were marred by very noisy children. On the first sector (on the very quiet A380) I was in the front cabin which offers a more intimate setting. A small baby cried almost all of the trip despite attempts by his parents to pacify him. So a decent sleep was impossible. Even the supplied noise-cancelling headsets could not eliminate all of the noise, and anyway they produced a constant repetitive buzzing noise. I fully support family travel and do feel for parents who have to deal with distressed children but surely SIA could arrange for a quiet area for travellers. The sector to Melbourne was worse. I was seated in the front row of the small front cabin - with 2 rows of seats and no bassinet places. Behind me was a family of 5 with a girly toddler who screamed for most of the flight. A baby crying I can understand, but this family was generally very noisy and seemed unaware that they were sharing the cabin with other passengers. There seemed to be no attempt by cabin staff to try to improve the situation, even though their exchanged looks indicated that they were aware of the noise. Added to that, the cabins of the un-upgraded B777-300ER's are becoming quite shabby and worn, and the IFE systems are behind the times. Because of the noisy fellow travellers I have to downgrade my ratings for these flights. It is a pity, because SIA are reliable, honour seat allocations and the staff are generally very good.

MUN-SIN: different story, plane, a 777 appeared cleaner and newer, and FAs were attentive. Sitting not even halfway through the plane, couldn't get my first meal choice on either Dinner or Breakfast. Exit row seats not worth it - cart kept banging into my partner's leg/tv screen as the config of the aisle makes there be a little ""turn"". Window seat on this exit row also has a restricted leg room due to protruding of the exit door. Singapore should rethink this config and do 2-3-2 for the bulkhead to make a bit more space. SIN-PER, FAs attentive, but still meal service was quite slow. IFE on way over seemed good, on the 777 on the way back, new KrisWorld system kept freezing for everyone in my row.

Flew from Singapore to Bangkok. The planes are getting old and quality depends on the type of planes. The newest A350 is equally horrible as the cabin space in economy is tightly squeezed to optimise seats for $, but missed out on comfort. The soft touches of SIA being premium such as haagen daaz ice cream, food menus, biz class toiletries pouch or previous-palatable local food in economy have been discarded for margins and this is where I feel SIA have lost their direction/plot.

This time, the wrap turned into a cold curry bread, tasted really cheap for sure, and breakfast only contained cheap fruit slices with main meal. FAs also forgot to hand cutleries in to passengers.

When the meals arrived (dinner and breakfast) they were the worst I have had on a flight. The seats are quite comfortable and you have privacy the way it is set out.

Very excited to be flying Singapore Airlines business class but sadly the reality fell a little short of the expectation. Yes, the seats are massively wide and the leather is lovely but it all feels a little, old in comparison to what's on offer with the Middle Eastern carriers. No turn down service (flight left Melbourne at 1835hrs) though a nice warm doona provided. The seat only has a thin foam pad as an underlay when turned down. Meals were served when they determined, not you. I say ""meals"" though for some reason there was nothing offered coming into Singapore although the menu showed a snack available. I used ""book the cook"" and the fish was sublime but the remainder of the meal was nothing too exciting. There is no toiletry bag though SQ pride themselves on having hand creams and lotions etc in the toilets. Which is fine but we all love a take away from a flight, surely we should be given a choice? Also, no pj's! These days it's just expected. The Silver Kris inflight was pretty poor, limited number of first run (decent) movies, I ended up watching some videos on my iPad. The screen size was quite small in comparison to other aircraft I've been on in J class. But the crew, they were fantastic. Friendly, professional, efficient, calling me by my name every time. 110% to them. Am returning to Melbourne on the A380 in about 10 days, I hope I can give a better account of my return."

Yes, they compensated us with a $75 gift voucher but the fact is this was my first time with Singapore Airlines and there were so many problems. Before take off, the TV that was supposed to show us the safety procedure was disrupted by a technical error.

I was very disappointed at the poor handling of my cancelled flight from SFO to SIN. Myself and a significant number of other passengers were not given any notification about the cancelled flight prior to arriving at the airport. I am also aware of passengers who had been waiting at the airport for more than 12 hours and did not receive any notification from the airline about the cancellation until the last minute. Moreover, despite trying for hours to call their hotline, I was perpetually put on hold. This was also the experience of other passengers. Ground staff refused to open their check-in counters to assist with our enquiries until 9.40pm and even then they were late by 20-30 minutes. Can you imagine the feeling of confusion and uncertainty when the airline was not contactable over the phone or on the ground to tell us whether the flight was delayed or cancelled. I have since written in to the airlines customer service and more than a week has elapsed without any reply or explanation - mirroring the complete disregard for their passengers they displayed during the cancellation."

Boarding in Sydney was well-handled with no pre-take off drink offered. Seated in front row 31A and B with screen on the wall. Food served promptly with drinks offered and juice or water brought around during the flight. Landed in Singapore on time and spent the transit in SQ 1st Class lounge due to Virgin Australia FF Status. Flight to Paris left at 10 past midnight and boarding was a little chaotic with no-one really taking notice of which lane they were supposed to be in. Seated in 33 H and K for the long flight to Paris and noticeably less leg-room than the front row. Cabin was only half-full so some people moved to vacant rows, however due to seat design they couldn't really stretch out. Which comes to my only complaint which is the design of the seats. They would possibly rank as the most uncomfortable airline seats I have ever sat in. They are too short in the squab (where you sit) and the leg rest is almost useless. I would hazard a guess that some seats in economy are more comfortable. Overall if you have only ever flown economy you would probably appreciate the slightly extra leg room and the bigger screens but overall I would save up and fly business class. The other thing with the A380 is you can't rest your head and pillow on the cabin wall as there is quite a gap between the two."

A380 on the upper level Business Class section. Service on Singapore Airlines is top notch, staff are very friendly and professional and treat passengers quite well. Food and drinks selections are excellent with a wide range of choices available. Having flown on several A380's primarily those operated by Singapore Airlines, I have found that this one offers some of the older seating which I am not terribly fond of. My problem with the seats is that the foot rest shelf is offset and does not allow for one to site with their legs straight ahead, instead you have to angle your legs slightly which is uncomfortable. Also on these older planes, the electrical controls for the seats are showing their age and heavy use by being slow to respond or not respond at all. For converting your seat into a bed, there is unfortunately no information provided and either requires you to spend a great deal of time figuring it out or waiting for an attendant to help you (or watch them while they help someone else). Basically the latch to release the seat back is located on the upper outer edge towards the aisle, but is well concealed so not easy to find even by touch. You must also make sure that the seat is in the full upright position before trying to convert it to a bed. Another problem that I have encountered is that the temperature in the cabins is usually on the warm side which makes it difficult to sleep well. With regards to inflight WiFi, it would be nice if this was included for Business Class and Suites passengers considering the cost of tickets on Singapore Airlines. Overall though I greatly enjoy taking this flight from Narita to LAX since the A380 is quite comfortable and less prone to the effects of turbulence."

Between Sydney and Singapore I was in 35A and 31A to Tokyo, the same on the return. There is no overhead locker space for 35A as the partition wall blocks the cabin bins, while 31A has a single storage pocket on the bulkhead, stuffed with magazines etc, rather than the double pockets on the seat backs. I utilised the Book-The-Cook service on all legs, which were nice meals but nothing to really to separate them from regular inflight meals in terms of presentation. The seats were nice and comfortable with excellent width, recline and nice leg rest. The big bonus was the generous 13.3"" screen size which was clear and wonderful for watching the IFE. However the high wall mounted screens in row 31 meant that any movie I watched or personal photographs I wanted to view, they would be on view to the whole cabin. Whilst seated in 35A, I could clearly watch what was on the screen of the person in 31K for example. The staff were super attentive as they always are on an SQ flight. The only hassle was the Auxiliary Power Unit failing on the SYD-SIN leg which meant that there was no AC boarding the flight and a prolonged wait to depart the the flight at Changi Airport.

Flew A380 to Singapore and it is so much quieter with slightly bigger toilets and even quieter flush noises than Boeing 777. The food on both legs was tasty, but nothing special. I ordered low sodium meals and I just felt they could have done more regarding how much food you got accompanying the main meal. 3 or 4 slices of Rock Melon and 3 Grapes and a mediocre bread roll, really?

Check-in took almost an hour. This was partly my fault as I was over the baggage allowance, although this had never been a problem with other airlines. The explanation was that SQ is strict with their baggage allowances - fair enough. However the amount of time it took was unacceptable. This resulted in having to rush through passport control and the TRS and left me with about 15- 20 minutes to quickly eat something before having to board the 4pm flight. The business class cabin was full of children. I had booked the flight 1 week prior and opted for the afternoon flight as the reservations agent had told me it was almost empty. I understand loads can change, but if I had known I would have opted for the evening flight even though this would have allowed only about 1 hour 30 minutes in Changi before catching the connecting flight. The food was inedible - my specially selected chef inspired meal of Tasmanian salmon was dry, with rubbery beans and overcooked pasta. The breakfast served just before landing in Milan was awful - two rubbery and cold poached eggs. There is no business class amenity kit provided - how cheap can an airline get? It just smacks of miserliness. I sent a formal complaint to Singapore Airlines and their lukewarm reponse was to say sorry. It is simply not good enough. Frankly, this airline has dramatically slipped. It can no longer be considered a top tier airline. The only saving grace is the personnel, who are exceptional. The business class lounge staff and most of the flight attendants were absolutely wonderful. However, this is not enough to redeem this airline. I take 3-4 long haul trips between Australia and Europe per year and will never fly Singapore Airlines again!"

We got very good fares by booking several months in advance. The ground staff at the check-in counter at Manila airport was very friendly. Service by the senior crew on both flights were outstanding, the junior staff seemed a bit indifferent. There was a slight issue with my child's meal on the return flight (her meal contained pork, which we don't consume so it was exchanged for a seafood meal) which was taken care of by the crew once notified - happy with that service recovery. Everything else was as expected from Singapore Airlines. Seat was comfortable for the short flight, the IFE was great and kept the kids entertained.

The use of the big A380 is a tremendous boon, as it is configured for far fewer passengers than it could actually carry, therefore seat pitch and width are set at very comfortable distances. Long-haul is never pleasant, so anything that goes towards alleviating the pain is most welcome. The cabin crew are always immaculate, helpful, friendly and courteous, and the meals are not too bad either. Entertainment system has extremely wide choice. Last but not least, their fares are much lower than any of their major competitors, which is surprising given the quality."

I am very disappointed by the service rendered by Singapore Airlines to their Economy Class passengers. First, they changed my seat reservation for my long-haul flight from Singapore to Paris. As a result, I ended up not being able to rest much on the plane. When I queried them on this change upon my arrival in Paris, they sat on my query and took more than two months to reply with a respond that doesn't shed much details on what went wrong. It has been 87 days and I am still awaiting a satisfactory response. Having endured an unpleasant flight and getting no clarification on what happened has made me feel like the airline doesn't value or care about the interests of their Economy Class passengers. Given their relatively higher fares even for Economy Class, I would urge customers to think twice if they are intending to fly Economy Class with the airline."

I checked in at Manila NAIA Terminal 3 and the check in staff provided excellent Customer service. I was very pleased with the service provided by the cabin crew as they paid a lot of attention to the passengers needs. IFE needs to be updated to cater to the needs of passengers. I was unfortunate to experience the first generation IFE Tv monitor on my flight. I feel that the airline needs to upgrade their IFE to ensure passengers are well taken care of. I will definitely fly again with them!

By chance, both flights used the new A350-900 fleet. For such short route, I guess it's partly to test the new planes. Not too bad an experience on the new planes. Smooth, steady and quiet in the air, a beautiful looking plane especially the signature long and curvy wings and rather cool batman-looking cockpit window. Leg space is larger than other economy class.  Noisy wheel box and luggage compartment mechanisms (on both flights so it's not a coincidence).  Insufficient aisle clearance as you pass through premium economy cabin so we had to literally hand carry our hand carry luggages at that stretch of the aisle. Noticed that cabin crew was struggling to find space to put hand carry bags into the overhead compartments.  Other than the beautiful outlook and smooth cruise in the air, the interior comfort falls short of expectations."

The food was decent for Economy class, cabin hygiene great, seat very comfortable, foot space also quite decent for a passenger in Economy and it's also a plus to provide foot rest. The only difference from my last trip is that Singapore Airlines replaced the IFE headphones to more compact earbuds which don't fit very well in my ears, and the audio is slightly poorer than expected. It was overall an enjoyable flight.

Food, IFE, crew etc. were fine (though nothing exceptional) but the seating was a big let-down. With a 1x2x1 configuration, each seat is absurdly wide, which does not make for comfort - with only one armrest usable, the other side requires a pile of cushions as a substitute. The beds do not flatten electronically, and need folding down by hand, a rather cumbersome procedure. When flat the bed is not particularly comfortable, with a small off-set ""cubby hole"" for one's feet. Furthermore, the overall feel of the cabin was pretty tired; I don't know how old this particular aircraft was, but Singapore Airlines started flying A380's in 2007, and this one was showing its age. All in all, their A380 Business Class accommodation is in need of a radical update."

Onboard, cabin staff are fantastic, and throughout the flight maintain a visible presence, coming around multiple times during lights out with drinks or snacks for anyone who is awake. The food is tasty, three options for lunch/dinner and two for breakfast, and both the menu cards and metal cutlery are welcome touches. Planes comfortable and clean. The A380 is wonderfully quiet, but the seat comfort and IFE system on the Boeing B777 is actually superior and I'd pick the latter given a choice of aircraft. IFE superb with a wide variety of films. Amenities in economy is quite basic compared to some other airlines (socks, toothbrush, pillow, blanket).

Cabin crew were great and well turned out.

I think that is really bad and has put me off. Some reservation staff are helpful but others have no clue what they are doing. Airline itself is top notch and cabin crew lovely.

Two minor differences: no more headphones but airphones and no drinking glasses on the meal tray but plastic cups. In fact I like the airphones which suppress the airplane noise a bit more. Plastic cups not really an issue but I prefer glass. More importantly: they still serve the cotton hot towels which is a real pleasure. Legroom was decent and the meals were delicious and nice presented. Service on the Amsterdam-Singapore leg and vice versa was of a very high level and consistent. I really appreciate the hard working cabin crew, nothing is too much trouble to ask for. When you push the service button an attendant comes to you generally within twenty seconds. What really surprises me is that they do not forget anything. When I asked for an extra bread or drink during the busy meal services they always came back to satisfy me. I have done this quite a few times and was never disappointed. Very different from my experience with other airlines. Unfortunately the cabin crew on the Singapore-Perth leg and vice versa were a little less attentive. Still good but not exceptional. Meal services took a bit longer and I think this is due to less crew than on SIA's long haul flights. I am happy with this airline and would like to fly in their new A350.

Seat was well cushioned and very comfortable. More then enough legroom with an extended footrest. Compartments on either side of the seats for mobile phones and other small devices. Compartment in the front of the seat large enough to fit a 15 inch laptop and an iPad. Smaller spaces in the console can easily fit 2 water bottles. Tray tables extend out of the centre console. Entertainment was standard with a 13 inch HD screen and a fantastic selection of movies and a less than desirable selection of TV Shows. Flight Attendants were attentive and friendly, doing checks of the cabin and there if you needed anything. Food was sufficient but I wouldn't say it was anything impressive. Beverage selection was fairly extensive even serving champagne before take off. WiFi was expensive and only came with 30MB but the ability to use roaming services on board was good."

I think the key of success is their consistency. Changi Terminal 3 has a dedicated check-in area for KrisFlyer Gold / Star Alliance Gold members. Check-in is always swift and quick. Selection of seats remains free except for a few exit row seats in the plane . As a KrisFlyer Gold, you can use the KrisFlyer Gold lounge which is usually packed. Food and drinks are adequate. I wish there were a few more spaces more conducive to do work and also shower facilities seem to be missing from the home base lounge. Singapore Airlines now use the group boarding system. I'm not sure if this really makes boarding efficient, but it clearly had lines for priority boarding which I try to take advantage of. The A330 is well maintained and clean. Seats in economy are comfortable with very good IFE.  A hot towel is provided upon boarding and a menu, the food is nice and on the SIN to ICN segments, they offer a Korean dish which is a nice touch. The only thing I wish is that SIA did a bit more random upgrades that some airlines offer to their frequent flyers. My wife is also a gold member for another Star Alliance airline and she will get consistent upgrades and that's a really nice reason to continue to fly with a specific airline."

I expressed my fear of flying on the A380 because it was a huge plane. The FA reassured me and was able to comfort me despite the fact that it was a rather a bumpy flight. Often, one of the female Flight attendants would come up to me and asked if I was feeling alright. The food served was greatly prepared and Im satisfied.

I did what they told me in making a lost luggage report at SFO with their ground staff. I waited that night for my luggage and nothing show up. I call the number they provided and it goes into voicemail despite a number of attempts. Try calling the general customer service line and they told me to call the same number. Told them that the number could not get through and the response that I got was they can't do anything. Tried calling the number again the next morning, same situation, voicemail. Finally, in the afternoon they called me back and said they have located my luggage and is on its way. I got my luggage the next day at nite. Is more than 30 hours. No apology offered by them.

Both food and entertainment of an excellent standard. I managed to sleep for 8 hours of the 12 hour flight. Only downsides are that the WiFi is expensive for the amount of data you get which means I didn't test it, and although there are 2 USB charging points there is no conventional power point.

The night flight on an A333 was not fully booked - just about 70%.  I was impressed by the efficiency and quality of service plus the smiles I got from time to time. On this flight of almost 4 hours they offered a full meal with the choice of European/international or Asian/local fare - plus a menu card. The food and the wine were tasty, got one or even two refills and felt fine . Arrival ahead of schedule, swift procedures. Once again a flight on the level they are famous for, they earn their five stars."

Seat width very large and about 1.5x bigger than BA's offering on their A380. Seat turned over to create a proper bed with white cotton sheet and duvet and two pillows. TV big and movies were the usual Hollywood classics and recent releases. Dinner was superb - chicken satay canapé followed by crab salad and then duck rice for main with a dessert and fruit / cheese platter to follow. Where BA had the edge over Singapore was in the wine and champagne selection - BA offering 4 champagnes over Singapore's mere one champagne (Tattingger 2007). Also Singapore gave no amenity bag and instead gave the standard economy class sock, eye shade and slippers - I've had better amenity kit in economy in Qatar Airways, Vietnam Airlines, BA to name a few. The magazine selection was poor as well with no suitable magazines for men under 35 years like myself. Service was tip top with attention on tap and lots of pleasing to my requests for their fine TWG tea selection. All in all a much better seat than BA given Singapore do a 1-2-1 config on business vs BA cramped 2-3-2. Would choose Singapore Airlines again so long as price was similar to BA."

Why the check in staff decided to put a couple in the center 2 seats of the 4 seat center row, with 2 men flanking us, on a long flight after already being in transit for 13 hours is beyond me. Very difficult to go to the toilet or even move at all. If they had put us on the side of the row we could have helped each other and not try to convince a strange man who cannot understand you or is asleep to let you up. This made a 22 hour travel day a lot harder than it needed to be. Staff on the aircraft could have assisted with the problem also."

Staff were friendly, the meals ordered using book the chef were great and the champagne which is poured on request is a nice touch. The seat itself is comfortable with very good leg room I did expect more recline and given the length of time Singapore Airlines waited to introduce premium economy, I expected more. To put this in context I think their economy class  is a very high quality product. The new IFE was excellent with a wide range of programs to keep you entertained. Overall I would say that it is an economy plus more than a business minus product."

There was a special transfer desk in the terminal, and the guy manning it was really friendly. On to the flight itself, my seat was very comfortable and food was of sizable portions and tasty. Krisworld was a joy to use and there were many video and audio options. The flight attendants were the key to a good flight, as they were so attentive, coming around offering snacks and drinks throughout the flight. They also responded to requests promptly. My only peeve was that the couple in front recline their seat all the way the whole time, including during meal times, or throw your blankets under your seat so that it eats up the space of the passenger behind you. Not to say, of course, that this was SIA's fault at all."

Service was polite, efficient and functional. We ordered muslim meals and the food was deplorable. This has generally been my experience with special meals on Singapore Airlines. Entertainment selection was very extensive. However, irritatingly, the content was badly organized requiring one to carefully browse through the material. On DEL-SIN we flew economy class.

Plenty of drinks and snacks offered throughout the flight. As quite a few reviewers have mentioned the food does not stand out like the rest of the service. I found myself leaving the hot breakfast on both flights. If you are going to pre purchase a preferred seat try and book in the forward economy cabin behind business class.

First of all, we were very disappointed with the seat. It may well be the broadest business class seat amongst the airlines but it is very hard to sit on. I felt very uncomfortable after 5 minutes. Singapore Airlines have obviously spent a lot of money installing leather seats but they have seriously overlooked the comfort factor. If you're travelling with a loved one the new 'pods' do not permit easy communication. Secondly, you have to make the seat into a bed yourself. This approach is just not good enough. For example, on Air New Zealand the crew ask you when you'd like to lie down and make your bed up for you. The service was just average. I asked for a 2nd cup of coffee with my breakfast on 2 occasions but this request was ignored. Overall, I was not impressed with Singapore Airlines and did not get my money's worth."

They always provide a great service and today's flight was no different. From priority boarding as a business class traveller and getting a pre-flight drink as soon as you get seated is always a good start to your flight. The service provided during meal times was good and had no problems with not having my preferred option. Food and drink overall was great. As for the fold out bed I found it too narrow and not quite long enough. But I still managed a comfortable rest. The bathroom amenities were very good and had exactly what I needed. One thing that leaves me with a good impression is the fact the crew are very willing and clearly enjoy what they are doing. I would recommend.

We then flew Singapore to Doha on Qatar Airways new A350-900 and from Doha to Cape Town on Qatar Airways Boeing 787-800. Seating comfort on their  B777-200ER was better than the Boeing 787-800.

Having flown SQ fairly regularly over the past 20 years it is interesting to see a decline in economy class, most particularly its lack of crew consistency. SQ used to be my favourite for its crew consistency in service and courtesy. Sadly, I notice it declining every year the past five or so. Check-in at Perth by snobbish and cold DNata staff quite a difference from past experiences. Perth to SIN was not bad on the older 777-200, not completely full so had a spare seat between myself and the window passenger. Legroom was good on these older jets, with an older entertainment system, which I tend not to use that much. The food was fairly dire for economy and portion sizes terribly small compared to the past. Why is the choice always a bland beef or fish (even when labelled the 'Asian' dish)? Singapore is a nation with a rich culinary tradition, but the meals were invariably bland and uninteresting on all four flights. Choosing the Hindu non-veg meals on the return journey to was more a fraction more spice, but again miniscule portions. But worse was the robotic and occasionally sullen crew. Not once on the PER-SIN did I see the inflight supervisor smile the many times he was in economy class. Just haughty and stiff. Upon disembarking, he couldn't even raise a smile for the economy class passengers. Apart from two very junior staff (about 1-2 months on the job, I asked them), who were pleasant and helpful and actually bothered to make eye contact, the rest of the crew I saw in economy were none of that. Mainly robotic, courteous but practically no eye contact and a cold efficiency. TYO-SIN was a dreadful red-eye special at the rear of a packed Boeing 777-300ER. A noisier plane more claustrophobic feeling large jet I have not encountered down the back. It was unpleasant for a nearly 7 hours in darkness. The leg room is just passable. The entertainment system was the only saving grace for those who enjoy it late at night. Food again was ordinary and bland and small portions. Drink service was stingy. I became visibly ill during the flight and whilst crew members saw me using a sick back and using the toilets repeatedly, did not once ask if I needed anything. Mostly the crew sat down at the back around the galleys gossiping in the interval between meal services. They worked fairly hard during service, but there was no warmth for passengers. On both flights, the time taken to clear the meal trays is now long, nearly one and a half hours on both flights. Unconscionable on a past-midnight flight when the majority of passengers generally wish to sleep.  For the passenger who remembers their finer years, I will no longer give them preference when considering my options from PER to TYO. A really disappointing set of experiences."

Truly great service with nothing too much trouble. Plenty of food and drink provided when needed and the inflight entertainment was good too - though on the Singapore to Christchurch leg we had an older aircraft which didn't have as many films etc. on it. Good comfy seats with decent enough legroom though on the older aircraft the fact that the arm rest didn't fully rise up and ""disappear"" into the gap between the seats was a bit of a pain.

Taste wise I've had a bad experience once and choice of food option wise I've not been able to select my preferred choice twice both of which was due to me sitting at the back of plane.

I was one of only 11 other passengers on the top deck so had 3 flight attendants to look after me. The seats looked wide and comfortable. They certainly are wide but after a while sitting down they became as comfortable as a park bench and when converted into a bed you had to lay across. What bugged me was that once breakfast had been served, the cabin lights were switched off. The lights stayed off until about an hour before landing. I was given socks and eye shades but no amenity kit. The food was okay but films and music were limited. I like classical music but once you have listened to the selection 3 times it gets boring. "

Their food is nice but the portion of it could be a little more, but the cabin staff are really well trained and thoughtful - before the plane was actually about to land they gave some candy to my child to consume as they knows that during landing the air pressure is quite nasty and kids might not like, and that's why she gave my child a candy."

Because of the crew and food. We travel regularly with stopovers in Singapore for weeks en route to Australia. Had always found the cabin crew the best, that is sadly not the case anymore. San Francisco to Hong Kong via Singapore and both crews were unfriendly - they only smiled and chatted when they were together preparing meals. They seemed badly trained - meal time was a debacle - instead of pushing cart, they seemed to be taking trays here and there. By the time I received my meal, it was cold - they never came and offered extra drinks, tea/coffee. Took ages to clear trays - in fact passengers were returning trays to meal area. When kids cried, there were no crew trying to help in any way - they were hidden most of the time. They found it very hard to smile! Their training seems to have declined - it's not just important enough to look after the business section, people in economy used to be treated well too. The food is as bad as the US airlines and now the crew is behaving like the crew on US airlines. I find it sad that I will have to try and find another airline. My daughter in law flew from Singapore to Geneva and Zurich to Singapore and she struggled with her 11 month old till she complained to the supervisor and then they changed the attitude! Really, is that what we all have to do? Singapore Airlines needs to get back the charm and friendliness it once possessed.  I hope when I return to the US I will find a big improvement in crew. If not, sadly, I will not be be traveling on SIA again."

Paid for Premium Economy seats as a pleasant surprise for my new wife but forced to take Economy seats. Singapore Airlines say they had to change the aircraft and so the aircraft we were put into had no Premium Economy seats. It seems to me it was easier to put on us another aircraft and apologise rather than find an aircraft with the appropriate class seats. There were others on our flight who were downgraded like us. Given the segment was from Singapore to London - it was coming from their hub. I find it hard to imagine that they didn't know in advance they were doing this and at the very least to offer a refund. Instead we were pulled aside as we were getting on the plane (despite having boarding passes with Premium Economy allocated seats) and offered an upgrade voucher for another flight (from Economy to Premium Economy). We could not use the upgrade voucher as we are not in a position to travel long distance in the next year before it would expire. It would also have meant we would have had to fly from Melbourne to Singapore to use this voucher - and then pay to fly all the way back too! I emailed Singapore Airlines 3 times and did not have a satisfactory response - the offer was that we could use the voucher on any segment (I don't think there are many segments longer than Singapore-London, so that would be a win for them) and $500 in travel vouchers for use in the next year with Singapore Airlines - again not practical for us."

I was soon put at ease by the cabin crew. The meals were excellent, the toilets were spotless and everything to my satisfaction.

The best landing ever into Singapore, so smooth. The cabin crew were just so wonderful. During the night they stood in the cabin or walked around with drinks and snacks. Food, again, was perfect. Toilets were kept clean and tidy. As comfortable as could be but nothing beats your own armchair. Unable to comment on in-flight entertainment as I did not use it. Would definitely fly Singapore Airlines again."
,,Business,Economy Class,SIN to DXB,August 2015,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4,yes,9,"Singapore to Dubai, and overall, Singapore Airlines lived up to expectations. Hot refreshing towels served followed by some drinks and then our meal. Was slightly disappointed with the meal, it looks unappetizing. Also, was slightly disgusted that the cup holder was stained and the stains were easily removed when I scratched it away with the towel. The compartments around my seats were pretty dirty, namely the earphone compartments, cup holder and magazine holder. I believe this does not reflect on all Singapore Airlines aircraft. Service was very good. We had socks and eye-mask for the flight. Toilets were equipped with mouthwash, toothbrush, toothpaste, comb and cups to ease washing up in tight space. Cabin crew were polite and presented themselves very well. As a Singaporean, I am very proud of our national airline."

After a late departure from Perth, the airline had covered our missed connection before we had landed, arranging a buggy to help move my mother about (she walks with a frame), and whistling us through check-in to our flight. The food was superb, and the service was sensitive and quick. The staff were always on hand to assist my mother. There was only one glitch. Because of our missed connection, Singapore Airlines had re-routed us to fly Singapore to Zurich, from where we would have a British Airways connecting flight to London -  an airline we did not want to fly on, preferring to pay more for the Singapore experience.  Arrival in Zurich was on time at just before 0800. Whilst endeavouring to locate where our next flight left from, Airport staff quickly worked out what had happened, and that we were on their lists as requiring wheelchair access. So we were in the wrong terminal, but the Swiss authorities took good care of us. The transit is easy if you know how. Our onward connection was on British Airways (Zurich to Heathrow) in Business class. The business class seats were so close together and being over 6'4"" tall, we were moved to the front seats. The meal was just sandwiches and drinks, so disappointing for a business class offering. Also, no-one had thought to let us know which terminal we would disembark at. The change was that we arrived at Heathrow T5, and not T2 as expected with SIA. The Heathrow staff were a godsend, finding our luggage (no mean feat) and even trying to track down our rental car, which had already gone to another client due to change of terminal. We felt cheated by this and it reflects poorly on Singapore Airlines to be organising this type of flight substitution."

I purposely bought an E ticket, paying 50% more to get that class, so that I could get an upgrade, but now that I try to get the upgrade, the website tells me the ticket can't be upgraded, and I cannot get through to a human on the phone. I sent a message through their e-mail system, but only got a confirmation that it will be attended to within 10 days. This is terrible service."

Service is very attentive, best I've experienced. TV selection and size of TV are very good.  Food was very good though they failed to achieve the medium-rare aspect of my partner’s waygu beef. The selection of port and dessert wines (if you like sweet) is good. First class lounge in Sydney is more private than the business class lounge, but much smaller. Felt that the options for food and drinks were somewhat limited. Shower facilities are good. This was the best flight I have experienced."

I have been flying with Singapore Airlines for the last 10 years, and overall the service is generally really good. But on my most recent flight, I was surprised to see that the service seems to have taken a bit of a downturn. Check in and Boarding at Sydney was uneventful. But once we boarded the plane, I realized that me and my mother were sitting in a window bassinet seat with the third seat being occupied by an elderly woman with a four month old. The baby in the third seat started crying during takeoff, and it was like that for half of the flight. Also, despite the fact that this plane was only a year old, the seats were already a bit weathered which made you squirm a bit to find a comfortable position. But the food and in flight entertainment was excellent. But even though the selection of movies are good, SQ has stopped giving economy class passengers the adjustable headphones and now gives the iPod style ear phones which are bit painful to wear, and because of that, we had our ears blocked even after we touched down in Singapore. The Singapore to Bangalore leg was much more peaceful since we didn't have a baby next to us, the food was still good but the quantity was less, the entertainment system also wasn't as reactive as on the first flight."

I'm a Krisflyer gold member and have been spending most of my air travels with this airline, but this time service is a bit disappointing, especially food. While IFE and seats are fantastic as always (and new too!), food and beverages were disappointing. They prepared not enough Japanese menu for breakfast. These day Singapore Airlines seems to be reducing the meal volume. Some flight attendants look like new hires and know little about passenger services."

I'd have to say the whole experience was great from check-in to service aboard. Check-in was relatively easy as I checked-in online and went straight ahead to internet check-in counter in Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. My baggage was more than allowance (32Kg instead of 30Kg) and the ground staff told me that I won't be charged. Service aboard was also excellent, luckily they have upgraded the aircraft to B777-300ER which is not new but offers better inflight entertainment system and seat features. The cabin crew were present and happy to assist passengers during the flight. There were three meals offered on SQ323, however I found that the meal has been reduced since last time I flew with them on the same route. No cake offered but changed to ice cream. In between snacks were available either offered directly by the crew or set in the galley. Selection of cocktail and mocktail are also offered on economy class. Singapore to Jakarta a short flight about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Cabin crew were pretty in rush to offer the meals, yet still professional. At this time, the aircraft was slightly older (B777-300A) which has older seats but surprisingly more comfortable than newer seats. In a sum, my flight experience for long haul flights from AMS-SGP-CGK have been positive."

,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,KIX to SIN,November 2014,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4,yes,8,"Singapore Airlines from Kansai to Changi Singapore. The seats were soft enough and there were blankets and pillows provided. There was turbulence and sleeping was difficult, and I gave up and watched the TV shows in the inflight entertainment system. Breakfast was served at about 3am in the morning and there were a few passengers who were annoyed at the prospect of dining in the wee hours. Stewardesses moved along the aisles to provide us with juices and water. Music was sufficient and there were loads of albums in the Entertainment system but there wasn't enough games.  However, to those who read this review and might think that Singapore Airlines is not up to standard, I am being critical and to be honest, Singapore Airlines is one of the best airlines I have ever flown."

The new seat for business class on this Boeing 777 is quite uncomfortable in that the TV is so near to the seat and my head. I got headache watching it for too long. The TV position at the side of my face makes its quite hard for me to look at the TV.  Malaysia Airlines business class seat seat is 2x2x2 layout but it is easier to view the TV. Qatar Airways seat arrangement is similar to Singapore Airlines layout of 1-2-1 but but it is more comfortable to watch the TV as it well positioned in front of your leg and equip with advance IFE systems. There is no business class travel kit provided by Singapore Airlines and it is a 5 Star airline. There is no such problem on Singapore Airlines A380 but the TV screen is 2 inches smaller.

The staff were really cheerful on boarding, pleasant and welcoming. The meal service was all beautifully done, but so slow. There was at least a 20-minute pause between each course.  Plus at breakfast they left me alone for ages, because they forgot my meusli. They were nice, but their service rhythm was way off. Worst of all was that seat. I was in 11K, which meant I was bulkhead, with a seat behind me. The guy in it kept moving about kicking his legs out all the time. Because of the seat design, his legs were right by my head, so  I had this thump of his twitching legs and feet, which made sleep impossible."

Despite some of the reports that standards had declined,  I disagree. The cabin was in very good condition and I like these seats - they are actually soft and comfortable. Service was efficient, maybe not overly friendly but still pleasant. I like the leather covering around most of these seats which adds a touch of class. Very good lunch service and a decent refreshment on the way into Singapore. This is the first time I have seen the flip down flatbed and I prefer this configuration because at least the seat has a comforter and is reasonably soft - flew Cathay recently and found the seat too hard to sleep. The angled sleeping is really a non-issue for me. Singapore to London Heathrow on the new business class. This is slightly better but I did not see a major upgrade - looks a bit more modern with a bigger screen. Same flip down configuration that worked about the same. Two decent meals plus snacks on demand meant that I arrived well fed and refreshed. Slight glitch on Krisworld was the only issue. Overall an excellent flight and certainly the best business class product I have experienced recently - no signs of cost cutting or service reductions from what I experienced."

The ground staff provided excellent service, however the service on board was not to the level of a 5 star airline. The crew seemed in a hurry to get done and rest. The level of attention went below the average airline. The food served (lunch and breakfast) was acceptable but below some airlines. The seat is comfortable and equipped with all you need on-board (usb charger, latest generation entertainment system, etc). On this route they provided an excellent Wi-Fi service at an affordable price. In all, the service onboard did not justify the amount of money spent for the fare."

Took the 15:30 from Los Angeles to Tokyo Narita on the spacious A380. Aircraft was clean and clean throughout, from boarding to final destination. Bathrooms were kept in a clean state as were the cabin. There are a variety of meals to select from catering to all creeds that included western, eastern, vegetarian, halal, diabetic and kosher. Snacks are available throughout the duration at no cost and include sandwiches, chips, cookies and drinks. The entertainment system had a wide selection of offerings for passengers from all walks of life. The crew was caring and showed concern for the slightest of problems. I would fly this airline again."
,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,SYD to LHR via SIN,September 2015,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"My husband and I flew with Singapore Airlines from Sydney to London via Singapore, with our 9 month old twins and our older son. We purchased an extra ticket for one of our twins to give us extra space. They initially had us all over the flight. Eventually just before boarding they allowed my husband and I to sit together but we lost the extra seat we purchased and they had three babies in a row! This meant it was so cramped none of the babies could sleep and they all ended up screaming for the entire flight (setting each other off), we bought the extra ticket to avoid this scenario. I noted that there were spare bassinets and empty rows elsewhere on the plane so that wasn't the issue. Neither we nor the other parents or surrounding passengers were pleased. Singapore Airlines are trying to do the same thing to us on our upcoming trip on the way home. They are arguing that since one of our infants has a child seat the baby isn't an infant, and can't have a bassinet, therefore since the other twin has a bassinet we can't be seated together. They won't budge, so one parent with have to juggle one baby on their lap somewhere else on the plane, whilst the other parent has the other baby in front of a bassinet. That's apparently more logical to them then just seating us together. So it becomes impossible to sleep, eat or go to the bathroom. We will never fly with Singapore Airlines again. Worst customer service experience ever."

Announcements were informative (eg. for passengers changing flights in Singapore), and best of all was the food. I think it was the best food I've ever had on an airline, and included plenty of snacks and a bonus tub of ice cream. I would definitely travel with Singapore Airlines again - they were excellent."

However, I must admit the cost cutting is very evident, for the quality and quantity of food and beverages.  While food quantity is not too bad, it is way less than what it was in the past. In the amenity kit offered in economy, the least they can do is offer a good toothpaste. Lastly, the staff should offer drinks either before the meals or with meals. If one has ordered a special meal, it is served before everyone else. However the drinks are only served when they come with the trolley to serve the general meals, which can be upto 30 minutes later - by which time the meal is either cold or finished. This was not the case in the past."

Check in MEL was slow, and airport security and immigration a mess. MEL can take credit for having some of the most rude airport staff. Comfortable seating onboard, Kudos to Singapore Airlines for keeping 3x3x3 economy class seating. IFE not best and of the older generation - not responsive and bad screen quality. The crew were outstanding and hard working. Generous servings of drinks including Singapore Slings. Sadly their food has taken a very bad turn south. Tiny mains and very uninspired. Food nothing in line with the elaborate and glossy menus handed out. Flight left on time but was late into SIN due to strong head wings. Good flight but several areas have slipped.

Flew A380 lower deck, aisle rear seating, reasonable experience, very smooth flight. Cabin clean and tidy, staff and service good, ground service also good. Onboard entertainment below par, selection reasonable but not up with some, food ordinary to average only, leg space and seating on lower level below average - tight between seats-limited leg/knee room. Having experienced the A380 I now prefer the Boeing 777 or 340. I spoke to friends who have flown upstairs on the A380 and thought it to be better option. "

I booked the cook and had a Nyonya dish delivered to me, it was very delicious and completed the nice experience of flying. Wide movie selections, music and game too. If only the big screen was also a touch screen, would have made this a 10/10 perfect flight. Then again, I wasn't complaining, and would not hesitate to fly with them again."

However, there is plenty of leg room. The biggest grip we have is the temperature of the section we were in, I am not sure what was wrong but people on the flight to Singapore from PVG coughed the whole time, the air appeared to be very dry and was extremely uncomfortable and the second leg the cabin was like an oven! An astute flight attendant made a call and within minutes the cabin cooled, but it was the same on the legs coming back, just too warm. We tried to get business class but couldn't, so we opted for economy which was otherwise not too bad. The Singapore Airlines service was lovely but the most mechanical I have ever had - nice and pleasant but without any personality. The food was just ok, was expecting a bit more from this airline and also they don't give out bottled water so you have to always ask."

We wanted to experience the Boeing 777-300ER. Although I had already flown it with Singapore Airlines a number of times, my friend hadn't, so we decided to make a weekend of it in Munich. Singapore Airlines  in-flight product and service have always been top-notch, and this trip was no exception. Flight on time, the seats are comfortable with generous leg room, IFE is very modern and the refreshment served on this leg is very generous considering the flight time is only an hour and a half. Even the little touches such as menu cards in Economy and hot towel they give you upon boarding, go a long way in making the travel experience that bit more special. What is also great is that Singapore Airlines was our cheapest option to get to Munich, it was cheaper than Easyjet. In sum, a highly comfortable and fun flight with warm and attentive service."

I had injured my finger while adjusting the seat belt buckle and crew was quick to provide me with antiseptic wipe and plaster. They were happy to share a word or two when asked. Next flight, Singapore to Kuala Lumpur, the boarding was quick and crew efficient and greeted with a smile, appreciative when I asked how they are. Although it was a short flight, crew was quick and efficient in giving out drinks and to attend to any assistance - truly outstanding service."

They have never disappointed me even though I fly in economy class. A slight delay out of the second leg flight out of Tokyo Narita, but the rest of the flight is smooth. Crew were excellent during both legs of the flight. They checked on passengers during the middle of flight, bringing water to passengers who were awake. Will definitely fly with them in the future."
,Boeing 777-300ER,Family Leisure,Economy Class,AKL to SIN,August 2015,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4,yes,9,"Recently flew SIN-CHC and AKL-SIN with SQ. They did not disappoint, although their drive for perfection seems to have the downside of making the whole experience a lot less personal. I would never have noticed this however, had it not been for the connecting flights on SWISS, where the personal approachability of the crew made all the difference. One point to note: The Child-Meal option is a grand array of a variety of children's favourites. Which certainly helps with a picky child."
,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,SIN to BKK,August 2015,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,3,yes,7,"Short midweek trip to BKK. No complaints about this regional business class service, but a little pricey compared to Thai Airways. However, Singapore Airlines have a more modern regional fleet than Thai Airways, and the flight times suited my schedule better. I did note an upgrade to the food offerings in the lounge at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi, which made a pleasant difference. Used the Bangkok airport express train service for first time, as little bags to carry. That's recommended."
,A 380,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Sydney to Singapore,August 2015,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,yes,9,Have flown Singapore Airlines multiple times and is probably one of the best airlines I have flown so far in terms of quality and service. I decided to travel on their new premium economy flight. The first leg Sydney to Singapore a A380 premium economy and the next leg on a Silk Air Boeing 737-800 which I won't be reviewing here. There is a separate line for boarding premium economy which is good. The seats were 2-4-2 vs 3-4-3 on economy. There are altogether around 6 or 7 rows with a maximum of 48 or 56 in the section. The seats are wider with more leg room and a retractable thigh rest. I did not use this feature much. It has got a bigger seat which is more comfortable. It is not a flat bed similar to business class. The food was good and I know you can order certain special chef prepared meals before boarding on the website. Champagne is available along with wine etc. The entertainment system is a larger screen which I think is either 11 or 13 inch and there are noise cancelling larger headphones available as standard. Overall it was a good experience and would not mind travelling on it again.
,Boeing 777 and A380,Business,Business Class,Brisbane to New Delhi via Singapore,August 2015,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,4.0,3,yes,5,"Lounge in Brisbane had been ""refreshed"" since my last visit and looked more pleasant. Had booked a centre seat on 777 as travelling alone and had checked in on line but reallocated to an aisle next to another passenger at the window. It is difficult for a fellow passenger to get to the aisle without disturbing you if you are asleep. Cabin was full so could not move. My personal preference if for a herringbone layout when traveling alone. Crew on the leg Brisbane to Singapore were somewhat helpful and friendly, less so on the leg to Delhi but both were OK. I asked for a water on board when in the air after having left Brisbane but was told by the crew member that they were going to a ""briefing"" and I would need to wait. It arrived 20 minutes later. Sleeping on both legs was a bit challenging given that the beds are not flat and you do get used to them being so on other carriers. On the 777 the passenger beside me woke me twice trying to get to the bathroom. Asking for help with the A380 bed was met an explanation of how to do and that it was easy rather that actual help and I had to go back to ask again. Entertainment OK but had to rewind to get to the start of the movie and it ""dropped out"" twice on the 777. Sadly, food was not great, my special meal is almost always the same on SG and was overcooked this time. Coffee was good. Wine selection looked good and had a Tattinger and a Chablis with both being very enjoyable. No bubbly offered pre take off on either flight. A380 cabin a bit scuffed around my seat but otherwise interiors were fine. On time arrival and departures. On balance this was my choice to India as Qantas/ Emirates were via Dubai or on a 737 on Jet Airways via Singapore or Air India via Sydney. SG thus offer a good connection and better service than Air India but the flights were not anything special."
,Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,Chennai to Brisbane via Singapore,August 2015,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,2.0,3,yes,5,"Chennai has no Business Class line through security so it was a long process, the benefit of this being that once you see the Air India Maharajah Lounge that you don't have long for the flight. The lounge is the poorest I have seen, looked more tired than those of Air Cubana in Cuba. Furniture was in disrepair, there was a bar that didn't appear to have been used for some time, sitting next to a disconnected fridge, no alcohol, food that looked inedible and was hardly warm and stained bulky furniture in the main room (this was full). Boarding was fast and efficient, the first leg meal was a salad of tomato, lettuce, cucumber and carrot with no dressing, butter but no bread and chopped chicken in tomato sauce that was dry and uninspiring. The dessert was melon and was the only thing I ate and went to sleep. The Brisbane sector was better in terms of food but still not great and the first meal I was served I have had four times this year (turkey breast which if you order GF you can also get for breakfast) but the crew on both flights was friendly and responsive. The Brisbane crew in particular was excellent and provided personalised service by name. Slight delay on the tarmac at Changi due to air conditioning warning light that was being checked by the pilot but arrived on time. Bags out within minutes as we were the only flight there. If it wasn't for the crew I couldn't recommend SG this time."

In flight system is ok, new movie and TV series. Food is good, I had three choices of main course. Cabin crews were attentive and good attitude. But it's not cheap, Melbourne to London round trip cost me AU$2600, other airlines such as Thai Airways only AU$2000. The service was worth the price. Wi-Fi is available, but very expensive."
,A380,Solo Leisure,First Class,New York to Frankfurt,July 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,5,yes,10,"Flying SQ Suites is pure luxury in the sky. This was a newer A380, for the leather seats were the revamped ones, with beautiful detailed stitching. I love the SQ suite for it’s very spacious, much more than the Emirates one. And when converted to a bed, the mattress they provided was very comfortable. This time I didn’t order Book the Cook as I ran out of time, so I let myself be surprised by the onboard menu. Had the 4 course chef special that was excellent. The service on SQ is all about Asian hospitality. It’s all about you, which when done properly, like SQ does it, makes you feel like royalty."
,A380,Business,Business Class,Sydney to Singapore,August 2015,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3,no,6,"First time on Singapore Airlines. Lounge in Sydney very basic. Apparently a renovation is in progress. Seat uncomfortable in comparison to others, staff did their job but without enthusiasm . Food good. Wine selection very average. Toilet at front of aircraft fantastic in size. Disappointing compared to reputation. "
,A330 & Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Adelaide to Amsterdam via Singapore,August 2015,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,4,yes,10,"ADL-AMS (via SIN) return. Overall, cannot fault Singapore Airlines. The flights, crews, service and quality of food and beverages were excellent. Have flown SIA many times and to be honest are yet to have a bad experience - even in economy. The crew on SQ279 on Sunday 9 August 2015 were warm, friendly and welcoming."
,A380,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Perth via Singapore,August 2015,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,5,yes,9,"Comfy, friendly, tasty food, no delays - even landed 20 mins early into Perth. I wish the IFE had more movies and games for children. Flight cost around £200 less than other airlines. Nice to be able to use WIFI, my mates were impressed to see me update on facebook."
,Boeing 777-300ER,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to London,June 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"A most enjoyable and comfortable flight with Singapore Airlines. On time departure, ample legroom, food very good, service excellent and IFE perfect.  Singapore Airlines continues to be my preferred international airline - they are truly are a 5 star airline."
,Boeing 777-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,AKL to ATH via SIN,July 2015,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"After 10-15 years of flying Singapore, I think I'll finally stop now. Over the last 2-3 years the service quality has become dire. Plane age and upkeep seems to be getting worse, with cabins uncared for. My biggest ire is the decrease in service for economy, or overworking the premium seats. Both in London, Singapore, and Auckland I've seen that they now have 3-4 check in desks for business, with no customers, yet only 1 for economy, with an hour long queue. The last flight (SIN-ATH), an argument broke out between staff and customers while boarding, as the staff tried to push past boarding economy customers to serve juice to the business passengers. I may not pay quadruple price to sit in business, but I am still a paying customer. Sorry Singapore, you've tried to compete with the UAE for business passengers, and alienated the rest in the meantime."
,A380,Business,Economy Class,HKG to SIN,July 2015,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4,yes,10,"Singapore Airlines is one of the best airlines i've ever flown, for me it's the best airline in Asia but why? 1. service on board is perfect 2. crew is friendly 3. food is very good for ECO 4. IFE has much to offer for everybody and is up to date with regards cinema films 5. groundstaff knows how to board the plane efficient and fast!"
,A330,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Adelaide via Singapore,July 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,"Flying Silk Air to Singapore and connecting from there to Adelaide. All went well, good food, friendly staff, but was hoping for a refurbished plane - nevertheless, for Economy Singapore Airlines is very comfortable."
,A330-300,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Bangkok,June 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,8,"SQ978 from Singapore to Bangkok. Flight arrived 10 minutes ahead of schedule on 13 June 2015, flight attendant was polite and friendly. I ordered the seafood meal and it was delicious. On 19 June 2015 on the way back from Bangkok seafood meal was good and very tasty. It was my fathers birthday and the cabin crew helped to it a special flight and to surprise my dad. In-flight entertainment offered lots of movies. The cabin crew on SQ978 offered top ups of my tomato juice without me having to ask. Economy seat is clean and new."
,A380,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LAX to NRT,December 2014,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5,yes,9,"Singapore Airlines is a wonderful long-haul airline to fly. The legroom and footrest are great, the food was excellent and the menu was very nice. The service and the entertainment was excellent. Music, movies, shows and games on the screen. Yet there is a smaller selection than on many other airlines."
,A380,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Hong Kong,July 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"Once again great service. The 2 hour delay prior to take off was a long wait, but the captain apologised continuously and instructed the crew to continuously pour drinks, even the inflight entertainment system was on throughout. Flight was smooth, captain occasionally made an announcement to update passengers on the flight status. Turbulence was predicted before hand which gave both the crew and passengers ample time to return to their seats"
,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Male,June 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"Once again, SQ went above and beyond in delivering the highest standard of service a customer can expect. Upon boarding and realising the aircraft is only half-filled, the crew offered my family and I each a row so that we would have a more comfortable flight. Before take off, the crew even engaged in small talk with the passengers, informing us of what we can expect upon arriving in Maldives and some of the activities we could join. During the flight, the crew walks frequently to check on passengers but are never intrusive. Drinks were served throughout the flight (without passengers asking for them). Furthermore, honeymoon cakes were given for couples visiting the Maldives for their honeymoon."
,A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,JFK to CEB via Frankfurt,August 2014,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"Singapore Airlines proved to be a true 5-Star airline. The crew was consistently accommodating, polite, patient and kind. The food was outstanding -  just as good as what one might expect in a decent restaurant! While their ticket prices aren't always the most competitive, the few extra dollars make the flight experience a truly enjoyable one."
,Boeing 777-200ER,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Rome to Singapore,July 2015,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,4.0,3,no,6,"A rather worn cabin interior, seats reasonably comfortable, but cannot be compared to the new upgraded Singapore Airlines business class product. Service was efficient, but rather impersonal by a tired looking crew. Food was dreadful. Overall a rather average experience. I am having another couple of long haul flights coming up - I hope they are back to the usual SQ business class standard."
,Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,Singapore to Auckland,June 2015,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2,no,2,"As a business class traveller, I find an arrogant and unhelpful attitude among staff, especially in airports, and mediocre inflight service. Business class seating, even the new form, is well below the quality of other airlines I use. Lounge access is also handled very unsympathetically for Gold Star Alliance travellers, if you are not a KrisFlyer member."
,A330-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Surabaya to Singapore,June 2015,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,10,"SUB-SIN, SQ931, 28 June. A330-300 on both legs. Hot towels were served shortly after boarding followed by food. Very polite crew members. The aircraft's In-flight entertainment was updated compared to last flight's movie. The seat on A330 was very comfortable with quite a lot of space. Overall a very pleasant experience and it's always a pleasure to fly Singapore Airlines."
,A380-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Hong Kong,June 2015,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,3.0,4,yes,9,"A memorable experience on A380-800 with Singapore Airlines. SQ861 on 27/6, delayed by around half an hour, but flight crew handled the flight efficiently. Window seat on the A380-800 was slightly wider, more comfortable than other ordinary seats. Cabin crew provided highly professional service throughout the journey and had frequent cabin presence. An incredible range of inflight movies including Asian and international films, with fairly large screens. Inflight meal was above average, though not impressive. Cabin temperature was too cold and more than half of the passengers had put their blankets on. In general, considering the high level of service quality offered, this flight had a good value for money."
,,Family Leisure,First Class,Bangkok to Singapore,July 2014,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5,yes,10,"My first time flying Singapore Airlines and impressed with attention to detail and politeness. Even though it was only a 2-hour flight, everything was flawless. The food was warm and tasty, seats were comfortable with ample leg room. "
,"Boeing 777-200, / A320",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Denpasar via SIN,June 2015,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,9,All legs without problems apart from a overly warm cabin on last sector which was soon fixed. Seats not too uncomfortable and seat pitch okay. Thankfully no one in front of me reclined. IFE is as good as ever. food good. plenty of drink runs. Check in and cabin staff performed as expected. One of the best airlines.
,Boeing 777-300ER,Business,First Class,Frankfurt to Singapore,June 2015,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,4,yes,9,Lufthansa Senator lounge in Frankfurt good. The cabin was very clean and excellent staff and service. Catering out of FRA can be iffy at times but was spot on for this flight. IFE good with plenty of choices. Amenity kit is ok. I think that SQ is as close to perfect as is possible. Have tried many others but not found them up to Singapore Airlines standard.
,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Shanghai to Perth via SIN,June 2015,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2,no,1,"The experience today at Shanghai Airport was a debacle. The flight was delayed 2hrs and 20 mins. This meant our connecting flight would be missed. What started out as a long 2 leg trip, slowly got longer. I then discovered that the boarding had moved gates. No announcement. I discovered it by chance walking past the departure board. Boarding was a joke. People were pushing in, the staff had no control or idea. The new gate was a transfer by bus. Followed by a 50m walk in the rain and up the stairs. The airconditioner on the plane did not work on boarding, we sat for over 30 mins sweating. When it finally took off, it was 4 hrs 20 mins late. This put us in Singapore at 1.45am with a 6 hours wait for the next flight. When we landed, they offered a hotel, 30 mins taxi ride there and 30 mins back. We said no and had to negotiate access to their lounge. "
,A330-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SIN to TPE,July 2014,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,3.0,3,yes,8,"My first experience with Singapore Airlines was wonderful, and nice economy class seats. The cabin crew served customers with a smile. The food could be better, the chicken rice was tasteless but Singapore Airlines do offer ice-cream at the end of the meal."
,Boeing 777-300ER,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Hong Kong ,June 2015,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"San Francisco to Hong Kong Economy Class. The seat leg room is good and there is a foot rest. Inflight entertainment system is also wonderful. The food was high quality for Economy Class, and the service is great, flight attendants are friendly and helpful."
,A330 and A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MNL to CDG via SIN,March 2015,2.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,4,yes,5,"Manila to Paris via Singapore return. The A330s on MNL-SIN-MNL are new, with comfortable seats and a little more legroom, compared to A380s on SIN-CDG-SIN. In the A380s, seats are cramped. Except for the idea of flying in an unusually large aircraft, I did not feel anything special during the trip. In the economy section of the A380 there are only 2 toilets given the number of passengers in each section of the aircraft. The toilet I used for the flight CDG-SIN had a clogged wash basin! Food service nothing remarkable, rolls  are very ordinary. The only thing that perked up these meals were the ice cream bars served as dessert. Check in service in Manila for the outbound flights to Paris was good - efficient and courteous. It was the opposite in Paris for the return. The check in staff was rude. The same thing with the security staff who man the line of passengers reporting for check in. They ""manage"" this long line by cutting it up into two and bringing later-arriving passengers to a separate line that, in effect, let's them jump unjustly over passengers who came earlier. This is an irksome experience from an airline that prides itself in being the best. A strong point though on my flights was the inflight entertainment, Krisworld, which offers countless choices. Overall flight experience was average."
,B777-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg to Melbourne via Singapore,June 2015,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,5,yes,10,"After more than 4 years since I've flown with SQ, I continue to be impressed with their high level of service and quality. Despite the aircrafts being one of their older ones in their fleet, it was well maintained and IFE worked perfectly. Their ground service was also really good - I was 10kg over my check-in baggage limit but SQ was kind enough to waiver 5kg of that so I only had to pay the excess for 5kg. Already looking forward to my next trip with them."
,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,MNL to FRA via SIN,May 2015,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,3.0,5,yes,9,"A very high class airline. We didn't expect to receive a meal (MNL to SIN) but they have it and also the entertainment is available. We didn't wait for a long time in Singapore to proceed on our next flight going to FRA. The entertainment has a wide selection of movies, music, games.  They serve delicious meals and always asking passenger if they need something. The only thing I don't like is that the seat pillow are too high for petite people like me."
,B777-200ER,Business,Business Class,Singapore to Johannesburg,June 2015,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3,yes,7,"Flew SIN - JNB on business, and in business class on SQ. Service to their usual high standard. Food out of SIN was very nice, food out of JNB was very average, but I assume that is dependant on what the local ground handlers can provide. Cabin clean enough and well maintained. SQ's lie flat seats - you either like them or you don't. I am in the latter category. Not supportive enough when seated, and too hard and with an odd angled lying position when flat. But this is old news and newer cabins are on their way. Main complaint was that this B777-200ER was a bit tired in terms of ICE (smallish screens with limited movie collection) and WIFI (there wasn't any!). The latter was a particular bugbear for me as the return flight was daytime, I planned to get some work done, but couldn't due to no WIFI connection. This isn't really good enough these days and SQ need to upgrade their fleet in that respect PDQ!"
,Boeing 777-300er,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denpasar to Amsterdam via Singapore,June 2015,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"Always nice to fly with Singapore Airlines. Again had great flights,  enough legroom. Entertaiment was sufficient. Very friendly crew.  Will fly with them again. Seat number 43A and C."
,B777-300ER,Business,Business Class,Dubai to Guangzhou via Singapore,June 2015,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"Flying on SQ business from DXB-CAN via SIN has been one of the best flights I've taken. The seat turned down into a full flat bed, great food and amazing service. I actually wanted the flight to go on for a few more hours it was that nice!"
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,3,MAN-MUC in May B777-300ER economy class. Check in and cabin crew very friendly. Punctual. B777 interior a little dated and probably due for a refurbishment. Food basic but as you would expect on a short leg. Nothing exceptional that would distinguish from flying another airline. I had a small ground services issue that the airline was unwilling to resolve on that basis I could not recommend.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,May 30: Singapore-Malé Maldives / June 1: Malé Maldives-Singapore. Excellent service on both legs: attentive warm discreet. Warm towel service and menu cards in Economy. Seats were plush and comfortable with footrest head rest lumbar support and ample legroom. Food was warm (presentation could've been better). Aircraft (777-200ER) showed its age but it was spotlessly clean. As I recently relocated to Singapore from the U.S. I look forward to flying SQ as often as possible.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,SQ11 LAX-NRT-SIN 12 May and return on SQ12 19 May. Was my first time flying the A380 despite a few bumps of turbulence near NRT I found it to be an amazingly quiet aircraft. Flight attendants were courteous efficient and professional coming through the cabin frequently with hot towels as well as water/juices to keep passengers hydrated during the 10+ hour flights. They also knew when to leave passengers undisturbed something you don't really see with many carriers. The seating despite being economy class was pretty roomy both flights weren't entirely full so I got some room to stretch out and sleep for a few hours. The only real fly in the ointment was on SQ12 where the aft toilets weren't working. That wasn't too big an issue as the flight wasn't full but I can definitely see where it would be if the plane was chock-a-block packed. All things considered though I really enjoyed the experience on SQ which proves why international carriers especially Asian ones are miles ahead of any U.S. carriers (with the exception of VX and B6). I would definitely recommend SQ to friends and family; I'm really looking forward to trying out their premium economy service when it rolls out maybe one day the suites!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,After travelling from London to Brisbane and back last month flying Singapore Airlines I must say I would recommend this airline and enjoyed my flights. All the staff had a very high standard of customer service. I hope to travel more in future with Singapore airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,SIN-SUB SQ930 26 May. A330-300 on both legs. Hot towels were served shortly after boarding followed by food. Very courteous and pleasant crew members. The aircraft's PTV was good the movie was updated. The seat on A330 was nice and better for other full service airlines operates this aircraft. Overall a very pleasant experience and it's always a pleasure to fly Singapore Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,3,yes,6,SIN-CHC overnight flight in economy. Singapore Airlines has been my favorite airline for over 30 years so I am disappointed to write a less than stellar review on this occasion. Flight attendants remain as helpful charming and efficient as ever. Food and wine are excellent down to the after-dinner ice cream. But this old B777 was tired. So much noisier than the A380 we had just been on. After being in premium economy standard economy seats were so tight. Poor tall guy in the seat in front must have found it tough. Even with a free seat in between myself and my wife it was hard getting in and out and a bum in the face is just not a civilised way to travel in my opinion. We really hope Singapore Airlines introduces premium economy and newer aircraft join this route soon! (The airline is scheduled to launch P/E in September). Another letdown was the IFE. Poor choice especially audio. I like to settle down and doze while listening to some relaxing guys. I gave up on both audio and video as the headphones were useless and the white noise too much to hear anything. Improvement required!
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,Traveled 4 segments. HKG-SIN-SYD and return on a 772ER 773ER A388 and A333. Haven't flown long haul with them for quite a few years but I think it has deteriorated. Seat pitch is too tight for an airline like SQ and the cost cutting in services is apparent with the bottle of water provided gone and wine glasses replaced by plastic and red and white wines now poured from a large bottle instead of the airline sizes they used to provide. I also remembered when flying long haul some years back they actually provided hot chocolate drinks throughout the night which doesn't exist anymore. It just feels a lot more budget than it used to be. In terms of the cabin and plane 773ER had the best IFE and new seats which i think is slightly more comfortable than the ones on the A388 and A333 which had identical seats and IFE but still I regard those seats as being too hard. While the A333 is supposed to be the newest plane at just 2 years old the fact that it's leased and a bridging plane meant that it was fitted with old seats and IFE the same as the A388 which SIA has flown as much as a decade. Service is OK overall but the SYD-SIN leg had a rather less enthusiastic air steward serving my section but I do accept that there are the occasional bad days. Sharp contrast to EK which I have also used during this trip. Seats better legroom better IFE better food better beverages better.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,5,Flew SIN-DXB-SIN first time in Singapore Airlines business class. Service was poor on the outbound leg. Planes are quite old. Middle East Airlines business class much better Emirates Etihad Qatar Airways. Wine glasses very small. General impression was not as good as I had expected of SQ.

In terms of the cabin and plane 773ER had the best IFE and new seats which i think is slightly more comfortable than the ones on the A388 and A333 which had identical seats and IFE but still I regard those seats as being too hard. While the A333 is supposed to be the newest plane at just 2 years old the fact that it's leased and a bridging plane meant that it was fitted with old seats and IFE the same as the A388 which SIA has flown as much as a decade. Service is OK overall but the SYD-SIN leg had a rather less enthusiastic air steward serving my section but I do accept that there are the occasional bad days. Sharp contrast to EK which I have also used during this trip. Seats better legroom better IFE better food better beverages better.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,7,We travelled on April 26th Brisbane Australia to Singapore then onto Paris. Came back Munich to Singapore Singapore to Brisbane. The trip Brisbane to Singapore very comfortable and the staff were fantastic. The other legs of the journey were OK comfort but found the staff less attentive.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,,,2,no,3,CPH-SIN-DPS-SIN-CPH outbound on 15th of May and return May 21 (four segments). Must say that I am very disappointed at their service performance. Having flown many times on SQ I did not expect almost rude service from some of the cabin crew attendants. This is not the 5 star SQ that I am use to. CPH-SIN was an old refitted 777-200ER with an entertainment system from stone age. The food was quite tasty tough. Next time I fly to South East Asia I will definitely choose other options like Qatar Airways or Thai. Much better value for money.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,yes,5,Travelled on SQ211 on 16 May 2015 Singapore to Sydney in Economy seat 32G. Flight was full mainly connecting passengers coming in from India. Our second (light) meal was served very late almost at the time when the pilot made the announcement for cabin crew to prepare flight for arrival and some passengers including myself were still waiting to be served! It was rather stressful to rush through my meal knowing the plane was arriving soon. Apparently the reason why the second meal was served so late was due to the high volume of special meal requests from the Indian passengers. I am a Kris Flyer Frequent traveller and travel often on the Singapore to Sydney leg and have experienced/observed this problem before where the meals are served later than usual because cabin crew are serving a high volume of special meal requests. Perhaps SIA need to review the management of special meals on future flights where there are many passengers travelling from India to Sydney via Singapore. It will be interesting to ask SIA how they will manage if 90% of the passengers have special meal requests on one flight! So this was quite a let down in service for me. I also have a suspicion that the in flight meals served have become smaller and lighter in portions. Another problem was my seat TV did not have Entertainment on demand! It was most disappointing especially when I was informed while most of the other passengers had Entertainment on demand programs mine was one of the few that did not have it! Surely this type of problem should be noted by cabin crew at the end of its last flight for service maintenance. I think SIA needs to pull up its socks to maintain its renowned high standards!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,SQ328 SIN-MUC 15th May. Full flight departed and arrived on time. Service was efficient although dinner service was interrupted by turbulence but resumed shortly afterwards. Seat was comfortable and IFE worked as advertised. Plane was an older 773ER and would benefit from a refurb. Otherwise a great flight and would fly them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,3,yes,9,LHR-SIN economy 12 May 15. Airplane was very comfortable with flat seats extremely comfortable to lay down (as it was half empty most of people had a row of seats for himself). Inflight entertainment had a large variety of movies of any genre. Food was good and generally abundant. The only two drawbacks were the delay it had departing from Heathrow (more than 1 hour) and the possibility to have dinner with reclined seats meaning that I had little space for my dinner as the child in front of me decided to do so. I would still classify a 5 star experience.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,It's decadent luxury to fly the SQ A380 Suites from Singapore to New York. Of course I'm tempted to compare them to the Emirates suites and I have to say that overall this is a much more luxurious spacious and comfortable product than Emirates. Minus the shower which I do miss on such a long journey. The suite is on the lower deck which is wider and the sides don't curve in as they do on the upper deck so the suite is very spacious. The leather seat is extremely comfortable and plush and when they convert the suite into a bed which is separate from the seat it's the best bed in the air that I've slept in. All this can be done because the SQ suite is modular where parts move up and down as they convert it from sitting room to bed room. The food and service was excellent as is customary on SQ. I sat in row 3 which is the only row with 3 windows. I like to look out and have as much light as I can so this is important to me. Although I still don't like the A380 windows for they are recessed and make you feel like you're in a submarine!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,MUC-SIN 777-300ER 5/5/15. Older plane was a bit rough around the edges but it might be one of the ones due for a refit. Flight left on time and arrived on time. Flew economy and had a whole row to myself that said there was still more than enough space if the row was full. Service was attentive with staff coming through often with drinks. All meal option available but it was a half empty plane so was not expecting problems the quality is first rate as always as was the entertainment system.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,2,yes,4,Brisbane to Bangkok return. All flights on time. All full. I haven't flown SA for 12 months now and I feel the service on board is slipping. Only three flight attendants to serve a full flight in the back section. No drinks except tea or coffee offered at meal times. I asked for a soft drink and got given a half a plastic cup. Serving a big chunk of chicken on a plane when crowded is virtually impossible to cut. I had to leave it. Breakfast hasn't changed in 10 years. Still the same old cold bread roll and cake. Planes seem old and dirty. My bag didn't make my Bangkok flight and was sent on the next one. Why this happened I do not know.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Jan 30 2015 SQ 517. From check in at Calcutta Airport staff were very professional and also assisted with your questions and as well as the immigration forms for your visit to Singapore. Once on board you experience Singapore Hospitality from the snack and drink service to meal service and also duty free service. The meal was hot and delicious. Wonderful staff seats and PTV. Staff professional and friendly to talk to these days you never get menus on the plane of the choices of what you have for breakfast lunch dinner as well as drinks wines beers etc. I will travel again with Singapore Airlines again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,KIX-SIN-KIX. A333 in both cases. Star AllianceGold check-in perfect in KIX but rather cold no smiles in SIN. Sakura lounge in KIX (poor) so we went to ANA lounge much better. Excellent lounge in SIN. Very comfortable seats on both flights. Better on first leg (row 48 with extra cost exit row extra leg space). Food and drinks at a very nice standard. Service perfect full of smiles. IFE failing on both legs as for many other pax. A serious issue. Luggage quickly delivered. SQ is without any doubt an excellent airline for Economy class.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,"Travelled LHR-PER via SIN January 2015. Flight from London was on a brand new A380 really comfortable great IFE good food good food friendly and attentive crew. Couldn't fault anything. Flight from Singapore was delayed due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft then they were cleaning and then it was announced there was a problem with the aircraft and they had to get a replacement. After a 2 hour delay we finally get to the gate my partner who is 6' 7"" and has had DVT asked about extra legroom seats (of which none had been available at the time of booking). After checking the system they said they had no leg room seats left and he should have purchased at the time of booking but as I said this wasn't available. After boarding the flight and finding our seats we see that 4 of the extra legroom seats have children in them with feet that don't even touch the floor. Safe to say my partner was fuming as he wedged himself into his seat. The flight from SIN-PER was on an old plane and the IFE wasn't great. The screens were bad quality but that was probably due to age of the plane. The crew were really attentive and brought hot towels and drinks throughout the flight. Overall Singapore are great with friendly and attentive staff. However they shouldn't sell extra legroom seats to children."
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,no,1,I travelled business class SQ218 from Melbourne to Cebu flight was great and comfortable. Had the new pod seats. Upon my return travelling home to Melbourne SQ237 was disappointing. The Business seats were tiny old and seat was at a very uncomfortable angle. A couple of hours into the flight my back was aching. I've flown a few times business class with this airline but this would have been the worst I have experienced. I think it's time the old planes are upgraded and the seats are refurbished. For the money we pay I think all passengers deserve a comfortable trip.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,"Melbourne-Shanghai (and return) via Singapore. Excellent service as always. I much prefer SA to any of the Chinese airlines to fly to China despite needing to transfer and costing more. The service quality more than makes up for it. Travelling with a young child we were given priority boarding priority meals extra little snacks and drinks etc.. and generally going out of their way to engage and be friendly to our son. Super polite friendly and helpful staff at all times. Plenty of food drinks and snacks and virtually every meal has a ""Chinese"" and ""Western"" choice. Economy class food and seating is very good for that class. Inflight entertainment is expansive with a huge selection of movies music games kids activities educational tools and flight information. Highly recommended."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Copenhagen - Singapore SQ 351. Singapore - Manila SQ 910. Manila - Singapore SQ 921. Singapore - Copenhagen SQ352. 19-30th April. My flight went perfectly absolutely nothing to complain about. Food and staff service is very good.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,SQ 231 Singapore to Sydney 28 April 2015. The latest iteration of this airline's in-flight entertainment system features a new touch screen and other refinements but appears to have dropped an important feature of its predecessor. Everything is now shown in wide screen ratio (16:9) and there is no adjustment - at least none that I could find - for standard screen ratio (4:3) so that older movies and TV shows are horizontally distorted and unwatchable. This was easily available on the previous system. As a frequent flyer on this airline this limits my options.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,LHR-SIN-PEN return. Flight from Heathrow to Singapore was the usual experience. Staff very helpful and friendly food good for airline food. Inflight entertainment is very good lots of choice. Good snacks available between meals. The A380 we flew on was looking a little tired a few marks and scratches on the seats. Flight from Singapore to Penang was with silk air. First time with them and very happy with the service.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,6,20 Mar 2015 SQ391. 22 Mar 2015 SQ217. 5 Apr 2015 SQ208. 6 Apr 2015 SQ392. Ground service was inflexible and unable to organise a meaningful seat plan for a group of ten. Aircrafts are pretty old and catering is ordinary. Space between some seats were very unacceptably narrow for an 8 hour flight. Timing and flight experience are good though.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,SQ11 NRT to SIN. Airbus A380-800. Although it's getting older and older (PTV not touch screen while some other airlines already have one) service is great as usual. Attentive cabin attendants. They even know how to deal with small kids so they don't meddle with other passengers. Food was great except dessert. They used to give out H-Dazs Ice creams for this route but not lately maybe cost cut measure I suspect. All in all a pleasant flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,SQ-318 SIN-LHR. Brand new B777-300ER new cabin in all classes including economy. Touch screen IFE Krisworld was amazing. Due dietary reasons I opted for fruit platters for both meals and they were great. Nice snacks between meals. Friendly cabin crew clean cabin.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,"FCO-SIN-CHC on March 29 and CHC-SIN-FCO on April 13. It's a long trip from FCO to CHC but flying SQ makes it more bearable. I used to fly Emirates but the service is terrible compared to SQ and EK use the 3-4-3 configuration on the 777 while SQ still uses 3-3-3. It makes a lot of difference. I am 1.83m tall and there is plenty of legroom on SQ flights. Service and meals were good on all my sectors. Cabin crew were uniformly pleasant and welcoming. Drinks and snacks in between meals were served frequently even during the so-called ""middle of the night flights."" I fly Economy class so I don't expect too much - with SQ however I get a good experience and excellent value for my money."
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,6,DEN-SIN April 2014. A330 was nice and clean. Comfortable seat and good food. Only complaint is staff tossed out the meals as soon as the plane had levelled off and seemed in a rush but didn't follow it up with much service. I expected at least a drink service (business class after all) and there was nothing you would have had to hit the call button to get service. Will know next time to request items from Singapore staff and not wait for service.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,3,yes,8,LAX-NRT on 4/4/15 and NRT-LAX on 4/22/15 A380. Based on a limited sample of two flights we can say the hard product is outstanding the service is good to excellent depending on the crew and the food is nowhere near the best of international first class. The seats are very comfortable and the beds are terrific. Both my wife and I had a very good nights sleep. The suite is quiet with only the gentle hum of the 380's engines. The outbound cabin crew were efficient warm and eager to be helpful. The inbound cabin crew was good but certainly not exceptional. They did their job well but that was it. Food was the big disappointment. Limited selections (unless pre-ordered) and ranged from ok (lobster thermidore and beef short ribs to poor (vastly overcooked steak). Caviar service good but not the best in the air. Wines were excellent. All in all very good but still disappointing.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,SIN-CPH April 2014 777 was in good condition. Nice layout in business class. Beds were good I am tall and just fit the bed system which isn't always the case. Service was good and food was decent. Nice lounge in SIN.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew from Manchester England to Sydney Australia via Singapore. And having flown from Sydney to Manchester and Manchester to Sydney many times only ever using Emirates and Qantas I found a cheap deal with Singapore airlines and thought I'd give them ago. Now being from England Emirates are one of the most advertised and so I thought was the best airline. How I have been very wrong. In economy the seat sizes seem pretty much the same but with Singapore I found the seat cushions were a lot softer. The major difference I found with Singapore was the service. They were always smiling and welcoming. And this being a night flight they didn't sit down for four hours for next meal time they circled with drinks and snacks in between more than once!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,SIN-SGN-SIN on B777-200 and A330-300 with vastly different experience. I have been a very loyal customer to Singapore Airlines but I have to say that please phase out the B777-200 series. The aircraft is obviously old and weary as compared to A330-300 series which is very new and more comfortable. The rest is just average but understandable given it is a short haul flight and I am not very particular about food and cabin crew help. Singapore Airlines still wins me whenever I want to book an air ticket.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,3,yes,10,I flew Singapore Airlines for the first time ever last August. Since then I have flown another 2 times to Shanghai return from Brisbane. I can not fault them. The food service and seats are great. The planes between Brisbane and Shanghai are always full but the service is never lacking. The A380 between Shanghai and Singapore is great as well when I select the exit row upstairs. I will never fly another airline to China again.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,1,no,1,I flew business class from Singapore to Delhi two days ago and the service was extremely poor and shoddy. We were flying in from Brisbane by Singapore Airlines and took the flight to Delhi after a stop over at Changi airport. So I was in a position to compare the service on two flights of the same airlines. While on the flight from Brisbane the service was good on the flight to Delhi the hostess was pretty bad in her interpersonal conduct  very poor communication skills overbearing almost irritating. On a late night flight a little courtesy helps a traveller relax but it was surely lacking. Pretty disappointed after all the slick advertising the real experience was shockingly bad. Money badly spent.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,no,5,I have flown SIA for years in and out of Asia. Usually good service but I have found it difficult to understand why they still have some old aircraft's flying routes - it does not represent Singapore well when it has one of the best economies in the world. The frequent flyer programme seems to have been altered also over recent years to make it so much harder to get gold status unless you pay lots more for tickets on economy. Recently I have noticed that they are handing out in-flight earpieces that I have had a bad experience with and dislike. Two flights recently when I used these I could not hear the movie clearly at all despite trying a new set. From then on I ask for the old headpiece sound sets which work well. Surely SIA can provide the best headpieces to go with its 'image'.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,We flew From London to Auckland via Singapore. on an Airbus 380. The review is based on all 4 flights as there was little to choose between them. The service was consistency high; attentive friendly and helpful The best I have flown and I am a regular traveller. The only disappointment for me was that the Book the cook meals were somewhat disappointing. I would have been better off with the standard meals. My wife found the beds hard and difficult to lie diagonally but they were fine for me. I would choose Singapore every time if I could.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LHR-SIN-AKL on A380. We paid extra for exit row seats on upper deck money well spent. They are doubles with massive space in front. These flights were the most relaxing long haul we have taken. IFE and service excellent.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Less than impressed. Rather tired looking 777 to Singapore. TV kept changing between colour and black and white. Seemed understaffed for the number of passengers on board. Return flight on an A380 - no sound at my seat. Again seemed understaffed for a full plane. Trying to change flight date even with changeable ticket was painful.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,3,no,2,"We recently flew from Singapore to Christchurch New Zealand. We are frequent Business Class travellers and were extremely disappointed with the service on this airline. The cabin crew were very disorganized although obviously not short of staff. Dinner took a long time to be served. We were not given a sample to taste of the wine we ordered and the wine was poured into a glass in the galley and then brought to our seats without even being put on a tray as were all the drinks such as water tea coffee etc. I woke up early while most passengers were sleeping and the hostess asked me whether I would like breakfast even though we were about 4 hours away from our destination. I agreed but then waited two hours for it to be served. The French toast I ordered was inedible the bread rolls and croissant were cold and hard and the coffee was extremely bitter. The flat beds are uncomfortable and you need the help of the cabin staff to put them up or down. The most disappointing thing was when I reported this to the airline they simply sent back an email saying that ""meals are served two and a half hours before landing"". I'm not sure what the problem was on this particular flight as our other flights on Singapore Airlines were good. The flight was on 7th February from Singapore."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,3,no,5,Flew MEL to SIN using a 777-200. Ever since SQ removed the A380 from Australian flights their value for money is no longer there. The biggest problem is the IFE. During my flight the IFE was not working the movie would break in the middle of the show and during some of the time the voice would disappear. Even with twice re-booting the IFE was not working. During the time that the IFE was working the screen is so small and the picture so blurred that it became impossible to see the picture. The adjustment of the brightness was also futile. Hello SQ these aircraft's should be retired as they are degrading your brand name and definitely not worth the money we are paying for. Even Vietnam Airlines now will be flying the A350 and the B787-900 to Melbourne soon. I'm really disappointed.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,,,4,no,3,We were making a return trip from Kota Kinabalu through to London Heathrow via Singapore on 28th February 2015. We checked in at KK in plenty of time we were the first people to check-in! We were issued with our tickets but not told that we would not be able to sit together on the 13 hour flight from Singapore to London we discovered that by checking our tickets before entering departure. We returned to the check in desk and were told that they were unable to change this as it had been 'blocked' (We feel that we should have been told this when we checked in). We were advised to talk to the transit desk when we arrived in Singapore. On arrival we went to the transit desk the staff were very helpful but we were told that we were still unable to sit together. We had explained that my husband was a very nervous flier. When we got to the departure gate they were able to change our seats. Why could this not have been done earlier and alleviated a lot of stress for us. The breakfast meal was not very nice. Initially we were told there was only one choice which was Singapore carrot cake which we didn't want as did most people sitting near us. We were found an alternative meal which was cold! We are regular fliers to Asia and have flown with Singapore airlines many times but we feel that on this occasion the standard of service was not to the standard that we would expect from a premier airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,SQ 917 (Manila to Singapore) and SQ 918 (Singapore to Manila). March 9 2015 (SQ 917) and March 11 2015 (SQ 918). Singapore Airline's service is more impressive than the last airline I took before. I got this flight 50% off from its original price from a promo so when they go on sale Singapore Airlines is more than value for your money. Even if they aren't on sale they are reasonably priced with the service and freebies they give. They have free- flowing drinks their food is impressively close to a fine dining experience and their staff is very friendly and approachable. Their inflight entertainment is good but the seat's legroom is a bit cramped.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,SIN-SUB and SUB-SIN SQ930/931. A330-300 on both legs. Impeccable service from the minute you board to the minute you get off the plane. Hot towels were served shortly after boarding followed by food. Very courteous and pleasant crew members and at all times kept toilets clean. The aircraft's PTV was good. The seat on A330 was nice can stretch longer than some full services airline in Asia and it's comfortable. Overall a very pleasant experience and it's always a pleasure to fly Singapore Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,I flew from AKL to SIN on January 13. The plane was an Airbus A380. The service was nice and the food delicious. The only problem was the inflight entertainment system the music and the movies would stop now and then for the entire flight even though there was no announcements. Despite that this is a very pleasant flight and I would definitely fly using this airline again.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LHR-SIN-CHC and return. Outstanding service food drinks and comfort in business class. Staff excellent attention and politeness with high level of customer care training. Altogether a fantastic experience.
,,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,Flew on redemption tickets SQ First Singapore to Seoul and Business back from Seoul. I was very disappointed with the first class. The last time I did First was to New York about 4+ years ago on the ageing 747 that was far better an experience. Pre-flight details were excellent using the Private Dining in T3 Changi. However the food on board was terrible. My wife ordered the Japanese Kaiseki and it was not good. My Wagyu Sirloin was leather tough.However Dom Perignon 2004 did help to wash it down. Fortunately the flight back form Seoul on Business was excellent with good food. I think SQ need to re-look at their inflight food standard outbound from SIN.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,3,yes,8,Travelled on DEL-SIN-DEL route a couple of times in the last month and though largely satisfied did think SQ standards are slipping a little. Given its always significantly higher priced compared to competitors I found it a little disappointing. As always no complaint on the service or IFE (except once as below) but was very disappointed with the food served on SIN-DEL leg both times (bland and just not tasty). One of the DEL-SIN flights on an A380 was a little worse than others with the IFE system not functioning properly for a large part of the flight. It had to be reset several times before it worked. Moreover the aircraft seemed a little worse for wear compared to the usual SQ equipment with some seat covers coming off and the toilet barely clean. All in all the problems were not significant but could be a sign of SQ becoming complacent on a route on which it has little to no competition.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,BNE-SIN-CMB-SIN-BNE in Economy Class. Flew A330 on all legs. Seats were comfortable cabin crew were polite and friendly and entertainment was great. If there was any complaints it would be the lack of leg-room (I am 6ft 2') although it may be more than enough for a shorter person. Would definitely fly with again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,MEL-SIN-KIX return. Outward flights around 30-40% full and close to 100% on the return. Food poor on the MEL-SIN leg but enjoyable on the remainder. Excellent cabin service by friendly proactive staff including numerous water & juice runs on all legs. Return flights both delayed by around 15 minutes due to luggage having to be removed after 'no-shows'. A good selection on the entertainment system although there were some lags and occasional freezing on the flights to and from KIX. The aircraft interiors all seemed to be in good condition and the seating comfortable despite the seat pitch being a bit tighter than I remember experiencing the last time we flew with the Airline.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,1,yes,6,SYD-SIN then SIN-ZRH and return. The flights over were at Christmas so the leg to SIN was packed. Late departure made for a very tight connection at SIN. Attentive service comfortable seat for a day flight and book the cook worked but the food was ok not outstanding. SIN-ZRH on A380 was quite empty upstairs so very attentive service with the whole back part of the cabin to myself. Toilets seemed to be cleaned after every use although they're the smallest I've encountered in a business cabin. The seat was good but the mattress a bit thin and the weird need to put feet in a small box on one side isn't entirely comfortable. Honestly there are much more comfortable options. IFE wasn't as good as others but a decent selection of movies and TV shows available. I can't say I liked all the advertising on it though. Friendly attentive staff clean aircraft and ok food and entertainment but in my opinion there are better options for far less money.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,PER-SIN-BOM. B777-200 on both legs. What can I say about Singapore Airlines? Impeccable service from the minute you board to the minute you get off the plane. Hot towels were served shortly after boarding followed by drinks and dinner. Very courteous and pleasant crew members. Dinner choices on the PER-SIN leg were limited to Pork Stew and Stir fried beef but they were not too bad. Breakfast was served on the SIN-BOM leg with a choice of Indian crepes or baked eggs with chicken sausage and baked beans. The aircraft's are showing signs of ageing though as some PTVs were not working and a couple of seats in the middle row seem to have had reclining problems. Overall a very pleasant experience and it's always a pleasure to fly Singapore Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,CPH/SIN - SIN/CPH economy. Two excellent 12 hours flights good seat comfort staff service superior they walk through cabin with juice and water three times per hour staff provide a good atmosphere and spirit in cabin and at all times kept toilets clean. IFE screens needs update too small and inferior image quality. On flight back to CPH captain made very thorough explanation prior to entering severe turbulence this info made many passengers feel better during the one hour rough ride. Have flown SIA regularly for 35 years still my absolute favorite.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,I took 2 flights with SQ in Business Class last week: SQ173 SGN-SIN - main dish was inedible - overcooked. SQ528 SIN-MAA - understaffed business class cabin could not prepare the food in time for half of the passengers 90 min wait between the first and second course.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,Generally excellent courteous service but Entertainment system which offers a vast selection of films is the only downside to the flight. I am constantly pointing out to the flight crew out of every 4 flights I take on SIA I will experience problems with the entertainment system on at least 3. If not complete breakdown it is usually a problem with âstuttering (picture freezes and then catches up but cutting out parts of the film in the process) and/or the sound disappearing half way through a film. My family members share my experience. Consequently the problem is systemic and chronic. The fact that SIA does nothing to improve this demonstrates not only a clear lack of commitment to delivering a seamless enjoyable passenger experience but also a lack of consideration for the flight crew who have to spend so much time unnecessarily dealing with passengers complaints. By the way system reboots are a very frustrating and annoying thing for passengers to put up with. But this seems to be the cheap route they have chosen rather than fixing what is patently broken.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Flew from SYD-SIN-IST Business Class on an ageing 777-200. Aircraft was the same all the way from Sydney to Istanbul. Whilst old the aircraft was very clean and well looked after. Food and Service were very good. The staff were wonderful. The Business Class seats/beds on this aircraft are a little hard compared to seats on other airlines which made it difficult to get comfortable on two night flights back to Turkey. IFE isn't as good as on other airlines or as good as SIA's newer aircraft but didn't affect the journey in a negative way. SIA would do well to offer pyjamas to customers in Business Class in the same way that Qantas do.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,3,yes,8,I took Singapore Airlines SQ 609 from Seoul to Singapore on 25 January 2015. The inflight entertainment system on that flight was not working properly and I had to swap to another seat to continue watching my movie. From what I understood from the onboard announcement quite a number of passengers were affected as well.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,RUH-SIN and back. Outbound flight was March 20 and sadly SQ now stopped this flight. Check in was smooth and RUH was well RUH. SQ 455 left RUH at 11.55pm on time and arrived to SIN at around 1.25pm. The flight attendants are excellent. The food was great and the seat was very good! You could sleep comfortably (it wasn't a lie flat since it was on a A330) and the other positions were very comfortable. The IFE was up to date and entertaining. Everything was on time and arrival at Singapore was perfect. I arrived at T2 and it was empty with barely anyone else there. The flight back was also good (but more crowded) and it was on time and comfortable (but it was a day flight so I didn't sleep). I would recommend.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,I flew from Amsterdam - Singapore - Singapore - Perth. The first leg was probably the best long haul flight I've been on. Service was excellent with drinks served regularly along with snacks and the meals where pretty good. The seat was really comfortable and plenty of leg room (I thought I was in Business class with the amount of leg room).
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew economy on 12 November from Sydney to Singapore. The service was excellent. The staff are so kind and helpful. Busy looking after all passengers the whole flight. Seats very comfortable. I was in the first row after business class and had tons of leg room. The food wine and entertainment second to none. Toilets exceptionally clean with good products supplied.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,"Flew IST-SIN SIN-SYD on B777-200. One of the aircraft had been ""refitted"". Both had quite hard seats. For the first sector I was seated in 51A which on a night flight gets a direct beam of light coming from the toilets on a regular basis. It's quite disturbing and I wouldn't recommend this seat to economy passengers in this part of the cabin. The inflight entertainment is dated and the screens quite small compared to other aircraft in the SIA fleet and other airlines particularly the second sector where the screen was exceptionally small. This must have been one of the oldest aircraft in the SIA fleet. It seems SIA reserve their ageing aircraft for the IST route. The inflight service on both legs of the journey was very average. I ordered a special meal so received my meal first however it took over an hour to get a drink to go with my meal which is served when the rest of the meals are served. I think there is some room for improvement here from SIA. I was surprised to have to remind the cabin crew about my missing drink as normally their service is second to none. The food was fine and well above average although the coffee not always hot. Check in staff were quite good at IST and as with almost every flight I have ever taken departing from Ataturk Airport it was a delayed departure - this flight by 45 minutes."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Our trip was Copenhagen-Singapore-Bali and return. Staff were very pleasant and smiling. The food was the best airplane meal I have had it was delicious and there was plenty of it. Seats where fine and the entertainment system on all 4 flights was up to date. Your boarding cards gets you discounts on various attractions in Singapore so keep them. Changi Airport is the best airport I have seen so green and a lot to do and see if you have to wait a long time.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,Singapore Airlines has finally upgraded their product on the Singapore - Bali route. Although the A330 is not my favourite plane the SQ A330 has the upgraded regional biz product in a 2-2-2 configuration which is way better than the old standard recliner biz seats on the 777-200. Happy to see the new product on this popular route.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I travelled to Australia via Singapore on the 10th Dec and returned on the 14th Jan. On both sectors out and back I received excellent service from the cabin staff. The choice of food was entertainment was very good and although it is a long journey the staff were polite and understanding. I will definitely be using Singapore Airlines again and was particularly impressed with the A380 airliner.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,,,2,no,3,Flown from SIN to BNE in Business. The aircraft an older A330 Seats were not flat the service acceptable but not 5 stars. Breakfast was not hot but just lukewarm. For that reason I was not keen in eating it. In my humble opinion that is the product is totally overpriced and it selling it on the name only. After the emerging of the middle eastern carriers you can see the features and benefits other airlines give you. Other airlines talk about. Please don't get me wrong the airline is acceptable and is better than other airlines but compared to what you pay and what you get I am sorry I would not like to buy this product again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,5,Having just returned from spending Christmas and New Year with family in Australia travelling Singapore Airlines 777-300er from Manchester-Singapore-Perth flight SQ327. I was allocated the worst seat on the plane seat no. 56G on the back row my knees were pushed up against the seat in front couldn't stretch my legs out under the seat in front because the seat was so close had to keep getting up to stretch my legs. I would like to know who allocates the seat number its not the travel agent he can only request an aisle/window seat is it Singapore Airlines at the time of booking (booked 5 months in advance) was it the only seat available? Is it the people who book 48 hours before on line or is it at check out at Manchester. I would have thought the back row was reserves for people on stand by or last minute bookings. Travelled many times with Singapore and always found them to be one of the best but not this time. Not a happy pensioner.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Singapore to Bangkok on flight SQ970. Check-in was quick and the staff are very friendly. The inflight entertainment was wonderful as it is been updated not long ago there a lot of new movies. The business class seats were great - big and comfortable. I order the book the cook - really good although an average portion. I will definitely fly with Singapore Airlines in the future.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,I am a very satisfied frequent traveler on SQ and this review only covers the way they serve their special meals in general and the inconvenience this procedure causes on short flights. I noted down the exact service timings on a 75 minute flight (SQ959) between Jakarta and Singapore on 4 Dec 14. Flight take off 15.05 special meals service started 15.15 I was served at 15.50 and my tray was taken away at 16.03 when I had not quite finished the meal. If you order a special meal you will be embarrassed to receive it too early when your neighbors have even not received their drinks. The tray-by-tray special meal service takes so much time that those receiving a standard meal have very little time to eat it at least on short flights. In the glory days of Malaysian Airlines (which I almost exclusively flew between 1998 to 2009) somehow they would bring the special and regular meals together so that all passengers were served at the same time. Wonder if SQ could think of some way to reduce the time lag between special meal and regular meal service? This is not a complaint but a suggestion.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,3,yes,3,LAX-NRT-SIN with no ground customer service to be found anywhere. The usually short refuelling stop in NRT became an overnight 17 hr delay due to Engine problems. Singapore Airlines held us on the plane for over 4 hrs and insisted on serving us the inflight dinner rather than let the passengers disembark. The hotel provided for Economy class was (Nikko Narita) was rather on the run-down side. First and Business where hosted at the local Hilton and another hotel (Did not catch the name). We had a connection to MDC the next morning in Singapore which we missed. That connection only flies every other day so that we had to stay two days in Singapore over Christmas rather than on our vacation. The biggest problem was that no-one on the phone or the ground staff in NRT could provide us with a new itinerary to our destination. To add insult to injury the first phone representative insisted that my flight had taken off as planned even though I had called almost 3 hrs after the delay started. The second one was even worse in first refusing to help at all as he claimed I had deviated from my booked LAX-SIN itinerary. It was only after some complaining that he finally realized that NRT is indeed on the route. Not that he had any further information to offer after that other than saying I would get more information in Singapore. Once finally in Singapore the representative at the gate who was supposed to have our onward information did not and had us wait for another length of time at the transfer desk in Singapore. There finally I was handed the boarding passes to our final destination and hotel vouchers. I am Executive Platinum with American Airlines and have seen my fair share of breakdowns and delays. However without fail an AA representative on the phone has been able to give me my new route/times within minutes of the official announcement of the delay. Onboard service on Singapore Airlines is certainly better than on AA. That said I will gladly trade in a bit of comfort for the knowledge that I am being taken care in a timely manner if something does not go to plan.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,SFO-HK I was disappointed in the overall experience. It appears to me the airline is cutting corners and not keeping up with the ME carriers. The seat although wide is not particularly comfortable in the seated position. The fully reclined position was better but the bed was hard. They would do well to add a comforter on the sleeping surface to provide a softer experience. They used to provide an amenities kit- no longer. The food too was just not as good as it used to be. If they want to retain their ratings they better spend a bit more on their business class product.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,3,yes,6,Travelled AKL-SIN on the old 777 with the incline bed. There was no topper pad for the seat so very uncomfortable to try and sleep. This is a 10 hour flight so it was not up to scratch. These days you really expect more in Business class. There are also 6 seats across so there is not a lot of room to spread out. The food was only just acceptable but as the flight left at 1am we didn't feel like much anyway. I think Singapore need to review their fares on this aircraft as it was barely a step up from premium economy on other airlines. The way back SIN-CHC is the refurbished 777 with a lie flat bed and 4 seats across. A quite different experience. A lot more room and even though it feels a bit weird to sleep diagonally it was fine. 2 comfy pillows. I had tried to book the cook but I didn't think it had worked online as couldn't see it in our booking but on arriving home found confirmation emails that it had but we didn't get our requested meals on the plane so don't know what happened there. The food was really good anyway. Service was fantastic from the crew in fact it was the best part of the experience. In Singapore they allowed our two sons (21 and 17)who were travelling with us but in economy to come into the lounge as we had 6 hours there which was really appreciated. On both trips the movie selection was dismal and the only amenities given out were a pair of slippers and an eye mask . There were some toothbrushes in the bathroom but they were all out on the way to Sin. This was our 1st time travelling business with Singapore and have to say was slightly underwhelmed compared to our other experiences.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,no,4,CCU to SIN in the first week of January 2015. Had a seat in Row 36 and as part of the boarding process was made to stand in a queue (one for different sets of rows) for forty minutes. This is a ridiculous ground staff strategy to ensure organised boarding. Considering the flight duration is ~4 hours with a pre 5 a.m. landing the cabin lights were on for most of the flight for catering and duty-free shopping. For a 5-star airline the handling of boarding and the management of the cabin left a lot to be desired.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,BKK-SIN-MEL. Of course the service could not be faulted. The main problem we had with our return trip is that we had medium haul 777 and on the way over the much more comfortable long haul product. The medium haul has an inclined bed seat that is far too hard and not at all comfortable whilst the long haul has the fully flat (and deliciously soft) bed- more like a cubby than a bed). It was a bit disappointing. As it was a midnight flight both ways the ides of offering meals just after take off or two hours before landing is a great one but the breakfasts on both trips were terrible on the way home inedible. I know the food in economy is much better.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,3,yes,10,Flew from Narita to Singapore on an A380 Meal was great service was top notch everything was close to perfection. What makes SQ special is that even if you are seated in coach the crew provides you with business class level of service and try their best to make your flight enjoyable. The only downside is that Singapore Airlines is usually more expensive than other airlines. Yet I am willing to pay more to travel on this airline.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,Took the A380 Suite HKG-SIN on 19 Dec. Flight departed slightly late but arrived on time. Great service and seat - amazingly comfortable seat. The only downside is the lack of storage. Could only store handbag under the ottoman. IFE choices were extensive and updated. Was given free 15MB WiFi. Pre-ordered Book the Cook's Lobster Thermidor and it deserves its online reputation. The rest of the courses were mediocre - more like Business Class food. Service was excellent as expected of SQ except that the FA forgot to return me my coat at the end of the flight causing me to walk halfway to Arrival only to turn back upon realizing my forgotten coat.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Heathrow-Singapore-Auckland return Nov/Dec 2014. All four sectors were on the A380 and I had economy seating on the main deck for two trips and on the upper deck for the other two. Smoothest take-offs I have experienced and smooth quiet flights in general. Excellent service from flight attendants who treat you like they want you to fly with them again. They would come back and check on people who had questions or didn't understand how to operate the entertainment system. Adequate legroom and very good entertainment system to help you pass the hours. Most meals were excellent and flight attendants came through at non-serving times to offer snack items. Only minor issues: the entertainment system would lag a bit on playback of films and the tray table/seating areas could use a bit of a deep clean. Otherwise this was the first time I had flown Singapore Airlines in nearly five years and it remains as good as I remember - my favourite airline. Highly recommended.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew from Melbourne to Singapore and back. Boeing 777-300 on MEL-SIN had one of the oldest IFE screens I have ever seen on SIA (flying since 2010). Priority meal for other passengers around me meant I had to wait for ages for a meal. SIN to MEL was a brand new A330-300 and had nice IFE and dinner served on board was the best I have had inflight. Serving dinner in the late night and keeping lights on meant there is no way you can sleep properly. I will still fly SIA because of their hospitality and cabin comfort.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,,,3,no,5,I flew from Melbourne to Singapore on a 777. Singapore to Delhi on the A380 and Singapore to Adelaide on the A330. In terms of seat space the oldest one ie the 777 was the most comfortable. I am 1m73 and the Airbus both felt cramped. On the other hand the inflight entertainment on the 777 was pretty poor with scarce visibility of the screen which makes it impossible to read subtitles on foreign films. The IFE on the Airbus was much better. The cabin and toilets were clean and the crew was polite and efficient on all flights. My main complaints are first with the food. I ordered a Lacto-Ovo vegetarian meal which was pretty standard. On all the outbound flights (and I'm not a fussy person) the meals were almost inedible. The other problem is that as they serve the special meals a long time ahead of the normal meals I ended up sitting in an upright position with my tray for over 90 mins not good. On the Airbus the trays are too big for the foldable table and therefore it keeps on sliding it's really annoying. The white wine was also not very good. My second complaint would be with the ground staff. They were particularly unhelpful at check-in in Melbourne. All I wanted was 2 seats together but they made such a big deal of it all and because I had booked under the Virgin Australia flight numbers I couldn't check in online 48hrs prior so that wasn't my fault. Plus on the outbound we only had 1 hr transit and because the flight was delayed we ended up having to run between the 2 terminals with no help from ground staff whatsoever so that was very poor customer service considering the delay was the airline's fault to start with. We did make our connection but it could have been handled a bit better. Overall I am disappointed and didn't find this airline to be that much better than any other ones. Not worth the extra money anyway.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,B777-300ER (SIN-LHR). Overall the flight was fabulous. From pre-take off to airborne to landing all cabin crews make their very best effort to keep the service went well throughout the flight. Cabin crews were attentive friendly and helpful. Cabin crews were always appeared in the cabin and went around to serve passengers some drinks and snacks after the meal services. The food was delicious. The cabin was very comfortable especially the lighting. I was lucky enough to board their brand new Boeing 777-300ER. Take off and landing were smooth without much noises. Also the lavatory were in clean condition all the time. This is the airline worth flying with and I would recommend to the others. Although I was flying Economy class I felt I was being treated as a business class or first class passengers.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Paris CDG - Singapore SIN A380. Everything was fantastic. The flight was on time. Cabin crews were very attentive and friendly throughout the flight. Food was good and toilet was clean all the time. Cabin crew were soft spoken with great language proficiency. My only complaint is to upgrade their inflight entertainment like the one they have in 777-300ER. Have flown with other major airlines to the majority of European cities SQ is still my favorite. Overall I am very satisfied with the airline and a big thumb up to the crew members. I would fly with SQ and recommend this airline to my friends and relatives.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,2,yes,4,Singapore Airlines is slowly losing it on their long-haul business class compared to other Middle Eastern airlines. I used to love this seat 7 years ago when they launched it however today it doesn't measure up to its competition. Especially given the price. You always tend to sit sideways which is discomforting after a while especially on this long-haul flight from Singapore to LA via Tokyo on the A380. This must have been one of their oldest A380's for the seat was tattered and basically a lot of wear-and-tear was evident in the cabin and lavatories. Moreover the IFE didn't work in my seat which was very annoying on this long flight. They tried to fix it onboard as well as during the Tokyo layover with no success. Since the flight was full I couldn't change seats. The food though was outstanding.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,,,3,yes,8,SQ Flight 346 SIN - ZRH on the A380. The flight leaves very early in the morning at 01.30. Singapore Airlines should really change the meal service concept on this flight. Having to endure a full service this early in the morning is just cruel torture when passengers would actually would just want the lights to go out and go to sleep. Why not hand out meal vouchers to passengers with plenty of time in transit to eat at a restaurant at SIN airport and then serve only a light snack on the plane after takeoff. Seats in business class look impressive but are unsupportive in the sitting position and too hard and too short when used as a bed. F&B service as well as inflight entertainment were very good. Crew were also doing a good job. Service overall however was slower at the rear end of the business compartment. Probably also because the top deck was a two class business/economy layout and I was sitting at the far end of the service rotation.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,I flew from Jakarta-Singapore-Bangkok. The check in from Soekarno-Hatta and Changi was handled quickly but it took a little bit longer in Suvarnabhumi. Staff were friendly and hospitable. The inflight entertainment was wonderful! I like their travel magazine. The economy seats were standard but kind of uncomfortable (for me). The food was good with an average portion. There were no delays and they gave me and my family who were also travelling with me a S$20 voucher for every passenger (didn't know what promo that was). The price was also satisfactory and worth the flight experience. Will definitely fly with SQ again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,DME-HOU-DME (flight SQ 062 and back with SQ 061): traveled to Houston with SA for business purposes. It was very nice and comfortable flight. Flight attendants were very friendly and openly. Food is very good and drinks as well. Three years ago I have flew the same flight and service is still on top level. Very good airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,Flew with my 7 year old son from ADL to LHR direct. Experience with faults and the airports excellent too. The staff remembered our small requests and returned throughout the flight to say that they had not forgotten. My son's request from the standard adult menu was given first. Our seats were comfortable and the plane clean. The food was good but meat a bit tough the Asian option was better. I have flown Adelaide to London frequently and this trip was the best by far. From check-in through to meeting my family at Arrivals I could not find fault. It's a long flight but I felt the better for it (and family commented on it too!) at the end due to it being so easy. Singapore Airlines really are the best for economy long haul.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,SQ 15 - Sep 29. SQ402 - Oct 1. SQ5357 Oct 24. SQ16 - Oct 25 2014. I have been flying SQ from San Francisco to India since 1990 when they had their 747-400 Megatop almost once or twice a year. Other airlines have cut down on service rudeness of the cabin crew has increased and fares have skyrocketed. In SQ the service and amenities always amaze me a very polite and professional crew and new equipment. The only complaint I have is how they serve the meals in the Economy class. Special Meals like Asian Vegetarian almost begins an hour before the regular meals and passengers on Long Haul Flights need to be sitting with an upright seat for more than 90 minutes with an empty tray in front of them. Aperitifs for Specials Meals are served well after 30 minutes after their meal when the food/drinks cart makes it way. Similarly the dessert (which is usually ice cream) comes an hour after meals.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,BNE-SIN-ICN and return on Economy. Consistently great service in all four flights the cabin crew were very attentive. Food and drinks were excellent in generous servings and the movie selection on IFE is more than acceptable. I always love their signature cocktail Singapore Sling. The seat was a lot more spacious than I expected after having flown with other airlines in the US the month before. I thoroughly enjoyed all flights although having an empty seat next to me in all 4 flights might be one of the key contributing factors. I am a frequent flyer and I have to say this trip is one of the best I have had.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,We flew to Phuket via Singapore and as with previous trips the flight went without a hitch. The service was great and the staff worked really hard to satisfy all. The food was above average and filling and the drink service well above board.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,Flew from Singapore to Beijing as flight SQ802 on the 15th of November 2014 and returning back to Singapore as flight SQ807 on the 22nd of November 2014. It was my first time on the Singapore Airlines Airbus A380 in upper deck economy. Boarding was quick and efficient for both sectors having it about 40 minutes before departure and with boarding queues ending quickly. Legroom was excellent (I am 170cm tall). Food on the Beijing sector was delicious however it was not served hot thus making it a little disappointing. Service was great as the crew smiled gracefully during meal service. However a crew forgot to refill my orange juice (She did not have enough orange juice so she told me she was going to get some for me but did not come). The entertainment was spectacular with tons of movies and music. However the movie tends to lag when viewed. So I settled down to listening to music instead. The seats are comfortable but the pillow is too big so I feel they should make it smaller thus having it to use lesser space. The return sector was much better. The crew were more friendly and efficient compared to the Beijing sector. My dad's luggage had some issues so he told me to board the plane first. As I boarded the plane the steward welcomed me warmly and kindly guided me to my seat also helping me to find an available container to store mine and my father's large carry on. Food was much better on the return sector on the flight as it was served much warmer. I had a great experience with Singapore Airlines and I would recommend it anytime.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew from Sydney to Zurich then Amsterdam back to Sydney. Staff were attentive and courteous. They worked very hard throughout the flight to keep things running smoothly. The toilets were clean the food was good and the flights were all on time. I would fly with Singapore again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,5,yes,8,Travelled CHC to SIN on 777. Lots of legroom IFE poor as screen too dark despite maximum adjustment and passenger announcements not loud enough. Staff ever helpful and smiling. Food on menu not great but snacks were. Flight on time. Then SIN to LHR on A380. Seating hard less legroom and very cold but preferable to being too warm. Needed the blanket! Food much better and staff excellent as usual. IFE had good choices but screen repeatedly froze and others experienced the same. Managed a good amount of sleep as plane so quiet but had to request eye mask and ear plugs. Why don't they ditch the stupid socks in the amenity pack which I have hardly ever seen anyone wearing and include eye masks and earplugs along with the toothbrush? Flight on time. Will definitely use them again. My 8th flight with SIA.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,SQ12 Sep 1st 2014. I flew from Tokyo NRT to Los Angeles on their A380. Flight left on time boarding was smooth and excellent service on board. Flight attendant extremely friendly and approachable great food and drinks (being served wine on a glass and not on a plastic cup in economy was amazing) and wonderful entertainment (they even had Italian series in it). My only critique would be more leg room. Would surely recommend them to others and look forward to flying SA again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,LHR-SIN-DPS. Flew on the A380 and booked the preferred seating for extra legroom. While this was a blessing the reduction in seat width wasn't ideal. The seats were a little too firm for my liking. Other than that the experience was fantastic. Entertainment choice was plentiful the food was good and the cabin crew were excellent. All requests were met with a smile and service is miles ahead of other airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,yes,4,Rome to Perth October 17. Older 777. Good seats. IFE still bad but everything else good on to Rome to Singapore leg. The Singapore to Perth leg was not what you would expect from Singapore Airlines. The crew were really rushing everything. Not sure why as it was 5 hour flight. It looked like they had trainees on board and the older crew were exerting their authority. The cabin crew were almost running between points on the plane. The coffee service was with the meal and the jug was flayed around with speed and not much care. There was no respite this sort of rush continued all the way to landing. I am sure this is an isolated incident I will still fly with them though.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew from SIN-MNL-SIN. Although a relatively short haul flight the crew were exceptional and never stopped smiling. The great SQ smile. Anyone interested in being pampered at 37000 feet with the best in service opt for SQ.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,SQ967 CGK-SIN / SQ306 SIN-LHR. Jakarta to London. First leg B777-200. Old but clean. I like the fact that SQ offers various dietary menu even for economy class passengers. Ordered a fruit platter and was superb. Second leg B777-300ER year 2006 cabin. Cabin a bit old but clean. Nice food attentive flight attendants. Although flight was full service standards did not go down. Two thumbs up as always.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,2,no,2,Can't complain about the staff and the service provided by them my problem is the delay that affected my trip. Dubai to Singapore was delayed which resulted in me missing my connection to Bangkok and rebooked on the following flight 3hrs later when returning back faced another delay from Singapore to Dubai. Have been using Singapore Airlines over 10 years and never faced this issue before.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,28 Oct Flt OZ574. 29 Oct Flt SQ609. 29 Oct Flt SQ 237. Clean planes comfortable seats. Attentive staff. Everything an airline should be.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew Brisbane to Beijing via Singapore and returned two weeks later from Shanghai back to Brisbane. The food entertainment and service was all very good and I particularly enjoyed the wide selection of the latest movies and music that they had to offer. All flights departed and landed on time. Food was nice but the breakfasts were not great. On the flights between Oz and Singapore we flew on the 777-330 with a modern clean interior and a very spacious amount of leg room possibly the most leg room I have ever had onboard a long-haul flight. The flight between Shanghai and Singapore was the worst - with very little leg room and felt quite cramped.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,PER-SIN-AMS in business class first leg on 777-200ER refitted and second leg on 777-300ER. The two things that really set SQ apart are the catering and staff service. This is really excellent food nice drinks and perfect service. Changi airport also remains a nice hub but starts showing its age. However coming back to SQs one cannot deny that the seats and IFE are not on par anymore with big rival Emirates with whom I flew the outbound leg. I actually quite liked the older style seat on the SQ 777-200ER in a 2-2-2 layout which is perfectly fine and even better than Emirates' product on their 777s. But I still do not like the very wide seat in 1-2-1 as can be found on SQ's 77W and A380. The seat is not good for lounging to wide and short for sitting and in order to use the ottoman one must sit diagonally and lacks good support in the back. Also having to stand up in order to convert the seat into a bed (and back) is not practical. The bed is hard and too short for me (I am 192cm). The IFE cannot compete anymore versus what the ME carriers are offering. Smaller screen less choice and most unexplainable: no IFE on offer before take-off while with other carriers one can board early and already enjoy half a movie before boarding taxi and take-off are over. Anyway flying business with SQ is of course still a treat but others do much better today. Am curious to discover SQ's new business class product which is now being rolled out for its longer range routes.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,My wife and I flew SQ256/S366 BNE-SIN-FCO in October and returned on SQ365/255 in November. The outbound flight from BNE was excellent. The staff could not be faulted. The seats and the IFE were excellent. We took advantage of book the cook from Singapore and the food was of a very high standard and well presented. The only stumble on the SIN-FCO sector is the old style IFE. My wife slept comfortably on the lie down bed The return from FCO was good - excellent service and good meals but once again - old IFE. We had chosen book the cook for the sector SIN-BNE but it was a let down - overheated and not very palatable or well presented. The staff did the best they could but it was a let down after 3 great sectors.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,5,I returned economy class from the UK on a London/Singapore on an Airbus A380-800 and Singapore/Brisbane on an Airbus A330-300. The previous flights out had been great mainly because the planes were only 3/4 full so everyone could spread out. However the flights back to Australia were jam-packed and sitting there squashed in my seat like the proverbial sardine I came to the realisation of what the airline had in mind when it purchased the A380 and it wasn't my comfort. Further this aircraft seems to be simply a larger version of what was available before so it takes ages to board and disembark as there are so many more people. In the departure lounge those of us in economy were forced to endure cognitive dissonance having to stand in a queue while those in Business and First class were given priority boarding. Can't these people be whisked into the aircraft out of sight? The A330 on the Singapore/Brisbane leg seemed to be quite aged. Further it was freezing. A few things were broken (eg the lid on the rubbish bin in the toilet). This seemed a basic thing to be broken also rather unhygienic. The sinks appeared to be stained. There does not seem to be enough toilets for the numbers of people on the plane. Economy class seating seems to be encased in metal with no padding to soften the blow. When the metal gets cold due to the freezing temperature this metal is decidedly uncomfortable. The thin polyester blankets supplied are barely adequate. They need to be twice as large and several times the tog rating ameliorate the cold. The things the airline boast about - food entertainment service - are all quite good but in the end I would be happier to spend the entire flight lying down in silence in darkness with a warm blanket and perhaps a good book that I can read by the light of my iphone.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,SQ306 16/10/2014 SIN-LHR. I recently had a block of five flights with Singapore Airlines. The first thing you notice is that they have a modern fleet of aircraft's the cabins are fresh and clean and importantly use the latest technology for passenger use. The service is extremely good onboard the stewardesses are very friendly and efficient as they serve passengers and smile which makes a big difference. The new aircraft's have the better seats they are quite wide for economy the backs give good support but the most important thing for me was the cushioning it seemed about right and after a 14 hour flight on a 777 I found it to be one of the best seats I have sat in on a plane. All flights were very good and I would use them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,Flew Singapore from Brisbane to Paris via Singapore and then return on the same path. Check in staff and flight attendants on all trips were very professional and helpful. Air con hardly worked between Brisbane and Singapore and was most uncomfortable. Also very disappointed (and annoyed) when offered peanuts as a snack despite telling the airline that I was anaphylactic to peanuts! After telling the flight attendant he was most apologetic and gave me and my family potato chips instead. Overall the meals were ok - especially good from Paris! Flew on the A380 between Singapore and Paris and there was plenty of room so were able to spread out and have a proper sleep! Flight attendants were most attentive and seemed to rush up and offer you more food or drink as soon as you showed any sign of waking up. Overall quite a good experience and I would recommend this airline!
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Simply perfect! Zurich to Singapore and back from Denpasar to Zurich via Singapore with my family. I bought the tickets online through their web site taking advantage of a special offer they extremely cheap. Upon reservation I was immediately allowed to choose the seats and special meals (I am vegetarian). Every flight was perfectly on time or landed early. Seats are comfortable and inflight entertainment excellent. My special meal arrived at the same time of other meals warm and very good other meals were also good. Large variety of drinks and good wine. Several times during the flight they offered water juices and snacks. I was travelling with a 4yr old child who was continuously spoiled by the cabin crew with gifts and additional food. We asked for sandwiches and snacks several times and they offered them immediately. Getting in the aircraft on the way back I remarked that the seat belt on my seat was broken. Ground staff arrived immediately they dismantled the seat and changed the belt. The whole operation did not take more than 5 minutes! A special word to the cabin crew it was not my first flight with Singapore Airlines and I am always astonished by how lovely caring and professional they are! They are always smiling never get nervous or stressed and are extremely efficient they never forget something you ask them!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,JFK-FRA-SIN-PVG and back to JFK. A380 on JFK-SIN and 777-300ER on SIN-PVG. Everything with Singapore Airlines and Changi Airport was superb. Great entertainment system great food great service great airplanes great economy seats. The food is delicious for asian taste they are one of the best I've seen. My feeder flight was delayed on my way to PVG so I missed my PVG-SIN flight. The SIA staff in PVG changed my ticket without any question or fee. The inflight entertainment on FRA-SIN leg was not functioning properly. When disembarking in SIN the airline staff gave every passenger a gift of leather wallet as compensation and apologized personally to everyone. I am very impressed by Singapore Airlines. They deserve to be a 5 star airline. I will definitely fly SIA again. If there was one thing bad is that I didn't really like their check-in staff in JFK.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,3,SQ markets itself as a premium brand airline. My recent experience SIN-MEL-SIN does not confirm this: small seats in economy class food and beverages left a lot to be desired and slow service. The one positive thing I can say is that they were on-time. All in all a poor value-for-money performance.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Perth-Singapore-Rome and return. Have been flying with SQ on and off for the over 20 years. Still the best airline to travel with. A true 5 star performer which has withstood the test of time.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,5,Travelled LHR-SIN-LHR on A380. Everything fine apart from the Air-Con at the rear of the plane on the upper deck. Paid extra for seats with leg room but was frozen both ways (esp legs and feet) We were told that this is due to the exit doors and the chilling equipment in the galley. Was shown the overall cabin temp (which said 24 but felt like -24 in your seat). SQ really needs to look at this but it maybe an Airbus thing rather than SQ.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,Travelled HKG-SIN on 30 September on the A380. Flight departed around 30 minutes later than scheduled but overall the flight was smooth and we arrived on time. Seat was uncomfortably wide but made better by the 2 cushions on each side. It was a pity that the seat including the storage compartments looked dirty old and worn. Maintenance could have been better - have seen older but cleaner A330 from Asiana. Food-wise is the usual Business Class fare nothing spectacular but was of good quality and quantity. Service was prompt and friendly.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Singapore to Milan Rome to Singapore. The flight to Milan was a Boeing 777-300. Service was again excellent throughout the flight and deserved praise. Food and IFE was great. The return flight from Rome was old model Boeing 777-200ER. The plane although looked new on the outside was old on the inside. IFE screen was poor and far outdated then the one they currently use on their newer models. Though I felt more comfortable in the seats. However I do not know why SIA still doesn't retire this old model. Clearly footrest seats and even the IFE was in a need of repair. Service on this flight was not as great as the previous flight. Request were sometimes miss and food options ran out something i had not experience before with SIA. A letdown this time for the return flight. I would still recommend based on the outbound flight from Singapore.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,no,7,Flew with Singapore Airlines in September between CGK and SIN then proceeded to PEN with their subsidiary SilkAir (return). As an athlete I had to travel with my equipment which are large in size and heavy. On the first leg the check in process was smooth as there were no lines although the plane was full. We were scheduled to fly on a 777-200/200ER but due to maintenance issues they instead used a 777-300ER which has better seats IFE and was spotless clean inside out. Boarding process was quick and flight attendants greeted everyone with a smile and addressed some of the passengers by name. What disappointed me was that they did not switch on the much expected IFE until almost halfway through the journey and to my surprise the food was both below standard (I tried both options). On the leg back they used the 777-300 classic series which was also clean inside out. Seamless boarding process yet again and great food. I shopped from the SilverKris magazine for the special F1 merchandise and it was a smooth process as well. But to my disappointment they did not switch on the IFE at all. For the time being I will opt for SkyTeam carriers Garuda Indonesia and Air France which allows me to pay less but get the same results.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Return trip to Adelaide via Singapore. Would not use this airline again nor would I recommend travelling with Singapore Airlines. The seating was uncomfortable and cramped extremely poor inflight entertainment the food was an ice cream dessert that was still frozen and inedible. One of the meals contained pork so tough I could not cut through it. Another meal that was supposed to be beef just consisted mainly of gristle. The only good part of all four flights was that most of the cabin staff were efficient and helpful. I found the whole experience extremely disappointing and certainly poor value for money.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,I flew from HKG-SIN onboard a B777-300ER (9V-SWO). The seats were fairly comfortable there was a good selection of movies on the IFE system. The food was good and the flight attendants were friendly. The only problem was that the PTV was not touch screen and the seats were getting a little worn out. I then flew back to Hong Kong on one of their 777-200's (9V-SRO). The aircraft had been retrofitted however the TV's were still old and the remote was stuck on the side of my armrest. Being 180cm the legroom was insufficient as their was an IFE box under the seat in front of me. Even with a massive box to run the IFE it was still slow. Once in the air the movie I was watching kept pausing because I kept accidentally banging the remote as it was on the side of my armrest. The food was good and the crew were impressive and had learnt the names of all the kids seated around me prior to the flight. After having the meal the lights were dimmed for the remaining hour. Even though the 777-200 hand been retrofitted it was obviously done in a rush as the remotes and TV's were still old. The crew are very good and the food is good however their seats are getting old and all their aircraft could do with an upgrade or replacement.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,BNE-SIN and then Silk Air SIN-CEB. Seating comfortable and the food and overall service was great. What can you say about the cabin crew they are above the best both directions the flight was well on time and connections and transfers met. The overall service provided across all levels of both Singapore and Silk Air exemplary. An airline is only as good as the crew that it employs and to that end they are the best in what they do.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,ZRH-SIN-SGN and back with A380/777-200. All in all nice flights with very good cabin service and an unbeatable Changi Airport. Positive: Staff very attentive and professional food of good quality good IFE reliability and safety. Great and well-priced stop-over program which has a lot to offer. Negatives: Though seat pitch of 32 in is not bad the seats on the A380 are not very comfortable sleeping is quite difficult. For the price you pay for SIA they could have gone easily for 33-34 inches. The cabin is wide and silent the windows are a bit far from the seat. The food is nice though i ate better food on Qatar for example. The 777-200 are a bit old and worn out not up to date. Though SIA is one of the best airlines I've flown with I don't think they offer the best Economy experience there are better products on the markets like Qatar Asiana or Garuda or Malaysia Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,MEL-SIN-HKG and return flew out on 7 Sep 12.05 a.m. on a 777/300 - older plane but service good arr SIN 6.30.am connected to HKG - this flight also good. Return HKG-SIN-MEL both legs on A380 - what a plane service seemed better than the outward leg. Could not fault cabin crew - all flights full. All in all will definitely fly with SQ again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,The overnight Airbus A380 flight from Singapore to London Heathrow on Saturday October 4th was one of the best flights we have experienced. The seats were comfortable the leg room was adequate and the meals or snacks were very good. Best of all was the frequency with which drinks were brought round so that the demand from passengers using the call button was minimal ensuring very little disturbance for the 13 hour night flight. The 11.30 pm departure and 6.30 am arrival helps get over the jet lag provided one can sleep during the flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,From Frankfurt Germany to JFK. A380 had a great flight was 30 mins late but the flight experience was great. Seats were comfortable and inflight service was good. I would recommend this airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,I have recently flown HKG-SIN-HKG on B777-200 economy. Singapore airlines not only did not meet the expectations but were also below the average level of other airlines. The plane was old. The seats were old and the in-flight entertainment system was outdated. The selection of movies was very limited. The food served on board was basic. The meals were served long after take off forcing you to be awake for the most part of the flight and fall asleep just when it is time to land. Never again.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,,,1,no,2,We took four long haul flights with Singapore Airlines in June and July and were frankly disappointed. On one flight they shut down the cabin for sleep at 3.30 on a bright sunny afternoon and insisted the window shade be drawn when I would have liked to see out. After that cabin staff disappeared and only offered water twice in the next six hours or so. On two very long flights only one meal and a snack was offered and once it took three quarters of an hour to get a second drink after meal service was over and the aisle was clear. On one flight the air con was set on an extremely high temperature most unpleasant. We paid extra to fly with them on the basis of their reputation for service which was poor. Meal service was slow and the choices of food ran out on two flights. In contrast a one hour flight with a regional airline managed to serve a full meal and two drinks between Manchester and Heathrow so it can be done!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,no,5,I boarded the Airbus flying from London to Singapore on 18 September it was two hours late owing to technical difficulties. Sometimes these things happen. However I was sitting in seat 41c. From the start the air conditioning was frightful. A freezing cold breeze blew around all of the passengers near the back of the cabin while the passengers towards the front complained that it was too hot. Also the stench from the toilets was unbearable and seemed to be wafted out of the toilets at regular intervals during the trip. I did not experience this on any of the aircraft's I flew with both to Amsterdam six weeks previously or on the flight home from Singapore to New Zealand. Although spoken to the staff were unwilling to acknowledge that there was something wrong. On the Singapore to NZ part of the trip I also tried to charge my Air iPad but it would not charge on any of the seats near where I was sitting. The steward said there had been difficulties with Apple products. Potential customers need to know this as it could be important to work during a long haul trip. I had been relatively pleased with Singapore Airlines but my experience on the Airbus has left me wandering if I would fly with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,SQ 224 and SQ 401 4-5th Sep. Best service. Flew MEL-SIN-DEL A380 super efficient service. Got upper deck which had ample space. Overall a great trip.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,"NYC to Frankfurt to Singapore. SQ25 8/23. Singapore to Heathrow to Boston. SQ308 8/30. We were very impressed with Singapore Airlines service from beginning to end. The food/beverage service was unlike any we have ever had on an airplane. The flight crew was more attentive than I have experienced at an elegant restaurant! The access to and variety of entertainment (movies and music) exceeded our expectations. The ""little extras"" (such as hot towels at the beginning and end of each flight socks and toothbrushes) were a pleasant and welcome surprise. Overall Singapore Airlines made a grueling 24hr flight much more tolerable! The only criticisms I would offer are the poor leg room (particularly in the middle section) and the location of the security check-in prevented the use of restrooms restaurants and shopping after going through security. We usually check in early enough to ensure there is ample time to handle any issues that could arise and then we use the restrooms/eat/fill water bottles/shop/etc after we are all set for the flight."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Sep 5th and Sep 9th PVG-SIN return trip. A380-800 on all legs. I have travelled with Singapore Airlines several times. I think they are on a downward slope. Both trips were on an A380-800(9V-SKK) the inflight entertainment was a little bit old and wasn't a touch screen. The seat pitch is little bit narrow and I'm 175cm. Next SIA have kept a lot of traditions such as the hot towel service menu distributed to all classes of passengers etc. Catering quality in SIA is still high food was freshly prepared beverages were plentiful wines and cocktails are never out of stock. Most of the cabin crews provide service with a smile. Overall a nice trip and good experience.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,3,yes,9,The Amsterdam flight is on the retrofitted 777-200ER which is excellent except for the business class IFE which is still the old version. It seems that SQ has decided not to upgrade the IFE on this retrofit thus the movie selection is not as grand the user interface is old and the pix quality of the screen is lower. I have always loved the SQ biz class seat for I find it a good balance between privacy and comfort. The meals were superb as was the service.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,I flew Singapore Airlines 777-300ER - on 21st August - Manchester Airport to Singapore on SQ327 then Singapore to Sydney on SQ 211 and I can only praise all the cabin crew working on all the sectors for their professionalism politeness attentiveness when assisting passengers and serving meals drinks and snacks. The food served was of great quality tasty and hot and throughout the long sectors the cabin staff were constantly serving beverages and snacks. Inflight entertainment had newly released films.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Flown with SQ from CGK-SIN-CDG last December in their B777-200 and A380-800 respectively. Easy breezy departing flight from CGK-SIN check-in was quick and professional (apart from CGK airport condition with their on-going development). Arrived in SIN surprised with a 20$ gift voucher to spend in Changi (SQ flights only). The next flight from SIN-CDG on 'THE' A380 (appropriately decorated with some mistletoe) was nothing but sheer pleasure. Although their seats are rock-hard the legroom is all that I could ask from a cattle class (I am 184cm tall that is a smidge over 6 feet). The IFE was good even though it is a little bit outdated it was still decent. The food? Inappropriately good! You should try the infamous Singapore Sling too! The service was well-mannered well- presented and well-trained cabin crews. The same goes with the return leg.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,2,yes,8,Flew MEL-SIN-FRA and Munich-SIN-MEL in Aug 2013. Excellent staffing food and IFE system. 1st flight automatic upgrade to bulkhead seat which had so much room! Dream flight. 2nd flight got put on last row windows seat. Nightmarish as so limited room! Plane on 2nd flights both times had severe turbulence to extent the food- servicing was suspended. Plane was old had leaking liquid from a baggage door! Nevertheless given amenity pack and offered plenty of drinks etc. Very good experience especially when I got to Changi airport.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,I have flown with them for quite some time now and while their service is usually robotic impersonal and lacking warmth flying with other airlines makes you appreciate how Singapore just does it right. Recently flew from MNL-SIN-DEL. MNL-SIN on a fully loaded B777 the aircraft is up for retirement but it is spotlessly clean and well maintained. The IFE was ancient but for such a short flight I did not mind it. Food was decent and cabin crew were as efficient and reliable as one should expect from SQ. Had a 6 hour layover in Changi which is without a doubt SQ's best asset. It's an airport beyond compare and would not mind a longer layover. Flight to DEL on the A380 with less than 100 passengers. Cabin crew were very laid back and allowed passengers to move about the cabin. The seats were extremely comfortable and food was excellent. Service calls were answered in record time and while one of the flight attendants was a tad cold one of the lead flight attendants embodied professionalism and warmth which made up for it. IFE kept malfunctioning and the movie kept pausing every 30 seconds or so which was annoying. Besides that one minor issue I would fly SQ again. They are extremely reliable their hard product is among the best and while their service is inconsistent when it comes to friendliness their efficiency is one of the best out there.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,,,2,no,4,SQ975 BKK-SIN A330 J - I was looking forward to my first flight with Singapore in what some consider the best business class in the sky. The seats on A330 were spacious and comfortable but the table surface is slippery and your meal tray will slide off if you don't hold onto it. This can be prevented by the use of a tablecloth as found in other airlines' business class. The previous passenger's socks were still in the footwell so cabin grooming could use some work. The meal was good but drinks service was infrequent. All in all this experience was comparable to a domestic business class on a US carrier - certainly far short of the Singapore Airlines I was expecting.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,SQ978 SIN-DPS B772 J. This was the second leg of the journey from BKK to DPS and despite the outdated regional J seats on this aircraft type it was far more enjoyable than the previous leg. The crew were friendly and professional and the service was very nicely done. We were called by name throughout the flight and rarely did a glass get below half full. Overall quite satisfactory.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,Flew with Singapore Airlines for the first time from HKG-SIN and back. What a contrast from the airlines in North America. The staff were incredibly attentive the food was good and the seats were comfortable. This was in the A380 on the upper deck.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,SQ947 and SQ378 Aug 19 2014. DPS-SIN and SIN-MXP. Nice flights attendants were perfect meal ok too many uninteresting movies.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,no,7,6 flights in July. Auckland - Singapore SGN-BKK Da Nang - SGN. SGN - Cebu. Cebu - SGN and SGN-AKL. All were full. At least 3 were late to varying degrees. On at least one occasion I suspect the delay was not due to congestion at Da Nang for goodness sake but due to late arrival. Only the first flight seemed a bit superior. That seemed to me to be small differences eg - a decent filled roll as a snack but mainly the staff worked hard all the time and seemed to have a service ethic. The food well - Take the coffee cup the wine glass the tub of water and the roll off the tray and really you are not left with much. Surprisingly the food on the SIN - BKK flight at 1600 hours was much the same as on a long flight. However usually it was a dry entree or a few small pieces of fruit plus in effect a snack box sized meal. The Cebu - SGN flight arriving at around 2030 about 1.5 hours late offered a snack box with 3 small cubes of chicken and a cm deep flavoured rice and perhaps a piece of broccoli - most children eat more. Spirits were not offered on the longer flights although they were available out of view nor wine top ups. A beer amounted to perhaps 80 mls that is 4 pours to the can. A little generosity goes a long way as does the impression of parsimony. Overall much the same as other airlines. The best food was on a Vietnam Air 1.25 hour flight where they managed to serve and clear a good meal. Although Singapore seemed to cope with routine any variation seemed to cause problems. One confirmed flight was rescheduled and a second rescheduled to another with a stopover making it two hours longer. Both were weeks in advance. I don't believe either flight was in fact rescheduled rather I was bumped. In the latter case although I was notified of a rescheduling it was much later that I noticed it was in fact a route change. On the return flight which had been altered some months before I had paid for a preferred seat. This was confirmed that I had the same seat. However in fact on the day I was given a non-preferred seat in the centre. This was drawn to the cabin crews’attention and they informed me they would and did inform the appropriate department as if that helped me at the time. Three weeks later no response. A refund would not even compensate for the relative discomfort. Had that seat not been available I would have taken the day flight on the un-refurbished plane they left us with for a year until they introduce a new plane.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,4,no,5,Flew from Osaka to SIN. No bottled water provided. Requested the Japanese breakfast and the meal came without the fish. Anyway shared the fish with my daughter who ordered the same meal and it was very salty. Requested warm water twice and the crew earnestly promised but never delivered. Upon landing while the aircraft was still cruising we could hear the crew arguing loudly among themselves as we occupied the last few row of seats - very unprofessional.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,3,Hong Kong to Singapore. I have travelled on Singapore Airlines B777-200 on the last segment of my trip. The aircraft was old the inflight entertainment system is poor and the seat is also old. I was quite surprised to see that Singapore Airlines is still flying with this old thing. Food was just acceptable but nothing special. The meal service (dinner) was very late. This keeps you awake for most of the flight waiting for the dinner and just fall to sleep a few minutes before arrival.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Sydney to Singapore on A380 SQ232 and Singapore to KL on SQ118. The SQ232 flight was outstanding. Very efficient crew with turnaround time for bell call being less than a minute. It was a rather smooth ride food excellent and good entertainment selection. SQ118 was a short flight of 45 minutes but again crew was excellent and proved why its still one of the best.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,The service on this short (less than 2 hour) flight and the delicious meal is what made the SQ flight experience outstanding. For the old 777-200 with the very old business class is certainly nothing to brag about.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew outward BCN-SIN via Milan as part of a MAD-KUL journey. For reasons we still can't understand at check-in in at MAD Air Europa checked our bags through to SIN only and couldn't issue boarding passes beyond BCN. We had to check in again at BCN which proved a blessing in disguise as SIA impressed us by unprompted noting that our bags weren't checked through to KL and organising that for us. Flight was on time and reasonably comfortable (on 777) crew handled some noisy adjacent passengers well by taking time to circle the cabin rather than going to them directly with our complaint. Food was OK; although obviously partly serviced from Milan with some uninspiring Italian products. Drinks came with good frequency although self-service option overnight especially for water might be better. Back SIN-LHR on A380. Again check-in staff did well readily changing our seat allocation to what we preferred. Flight delayed mostly by re-routing 75 minutes causing some stress over connections in London - no information offered on those at all. Service OK with choice of three meals (against only two outbound). Breakfast could do with better bakery selection but hot choices both OK. Strange that despite the one hour delay it was offered a good 2.5 hours before arrival (ie 3.30 in the morning London time) and in a vary patchy fashion with different parts of the cabin served seemingly at random. IFE worked OK on both flights lots of channels although not everything on them appears on the menus which is confusing. Wifi offered on A380 but pay as you go so no experience of that. In all entirely satisfactory product but not outstanding or memorable although customer care at check-in was well beyond usual experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,"Gold Frequent Flyer with Singapore Airlines for last seven years. Regularly upgrade to business class. Singapore's new planes are for the most part very good. There is however an increasing indifference to FF status in economy. The last three economy trips Singapore sales staff on allocating seating have assured me that ""no aisle seats further forward are available"". When checking online however there have been several - it's just that the aisle seats have been beside other vacant seats."
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,RUH-SIN-MNL-SIN-RUH in economy. One thing I can say about this airline - excellent landings. I will miss this airline when it removes the Riyadh route in September or October 2014. Clean inflight food and entertainment is excellent.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew from Perth to London and back great service flight and plenty of food. Travelled by the A380 777 A330 with ample leg room for someone tall. Food was very good for a vegetarian. Best long haul flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,SQ 323 AMS-SIN with B777-200ER I had been aware that this is a retrofitted aircraft but surprisingly the aircraft was very well maintained. The seats are very comfortable in economy class the legroom is pretty spacious for me. The lunch service with three options which I have not personally had before and both quantity and quality of meals are at the top level of service. The most important thing about the sector should be the cabin crew they were very attentive. Overall I have been very pleased with the quality given by Singapore Airlines and recommend the airline for long haul flights.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,SQ246 July 7th BNE-SIN. SQ422 8th July BNE-BOM. SQ421 17th July BOM-SIN. SQ255 18th July SIN-BNE. I have been flying with SQ for the last 5 years. They have excellent service staff and crew members and a great on-time performance record! Some aircraft's are a bit old (example: Boeing 777-200ER that flies between SYD and BOM). The screen resolution and quality is quite poor on this aircraft but the crew members are friendly and great to talk to if you don't want to watch movies/TV.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,LHR-SIN-LHR. Outbound leg on the older 777 but the seat was comfortable enough. IFE was also the older system but worked well and the headphones were excellent (after a broken pair was replaced). Crew generally good and attentive although some far better than others and the service was a bit abrupt at times with items being almost snatched away. Inbound flight left SIN at 1.30am dinner served about an hour into the flight then lights out. Used the 'book the cook' service outbound monkfish as excellent return curry a bit hotter than I was expecting but good quality.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,1,no,5,Flew business class from SIN-MEL overnight on a 777. Very disappointed in the shabby scuffed and old cabin. The seats were narrow (compared to 777-300ER and A380) and did not lie fully flat (this should be standard for a premium airline). I had some emails to send and found that there was no wifi available (again this is offered on their 777-300ER and A380). I wouldn't mind if there was a discount for this plane model but for Singapore Airlines high prices passengers deserve better.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,,,3,no,4,July 2014 SIN-MNL-SIN. Seats were OK for both sectors. Leg space for A330 was narrow but MNL-SIN B777-200 retrofitted seats have more space. However B777-200 'new' PTV shrunk and low resolutions. Both sector's in flight meals were disappointing. SQ's meals standard have dropped in the past one year. They should ask their own chef to try out first before sending to cabin.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,3,9 July Auckland - Singapore. Seats not comfortable; leg space just about adequate. PTVs small and old. Cabin too warm. In flight meals disappointing. Service was reasonable but could have been better. Disappointing flight all round. Not looking forward to journey home.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,no,3,Flew SYD-SIN-LHR then reverse. Originally was meant to be A380-B747 outbound then A380 for both legs inbound. This was changed to B777-300 and B747 out and B777-300 in. The B777 was exceedingly cramped with very little leg room. When reclining the seat moves forward further reducing your already limited legroom and when the passenger in front reclines the seat back comes very close to you. Sardines in a can spring to mind. On the return trip because of the change of 'plane outbound I checked on-line and discovered the change so for the second leg SIN- SYD I managed to change my seats to next to emergency door definitely worth paying the extra. As for the seats themselves on the B777 the seats are very hard with not much in the way of cushioning making a bad situation worse. From LHr-SIN the in-flight entertainment was a modern touchscreen unit with an extensive choice but was extremely sensitive and with the closeness of it next to your knees the slightest choice would activate it illuminating your area and your fellow passengers with light not good if wanting to sleep that is if you can sleep in the crowded conditions. From SIN-SYD the unit was an old system with very limited choice and I soon gave up with it. Having flown SIA many times before I was really looking forward to flying with them to experience the (relative) comfort of the A380 yet again. What a disappointment! Previously whenever asked I would say that SIA was my favourite airline but these cost-cutting measures have made me re-evaluate that.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Travelled SYD-SIN-ZRH. SYD-SIN on the old (and very full) 777-200. The entertainment system on this leg is awful barely any good movies to watch very limited. Food was fine. Arrived in Singapore early gate to connecting flight just next door too good to be true. They say if it's too good to be true it probably is - the flight to Zurich was delayed 4 hours due to a hydraulic problem with the plane (oil leaking throughout the wing). Although this was extremely frustrating the staff were extremely helpful assisting people who were going to miss their next connecting flights etc. When we finally got on the flight to Zurich (an A380) the staff were great. Food pretty good and entertainment much better. Singapore Airlines always provide excellent service and Changi airport is very easy to navigate.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Redeemed an award flight for the family on NGO-SIN leg on 8 July 2014. Fantastic service as expected of SQ Business Class. IFS switched effortlessly to dialect and Mandarin when speaking to my parents who do not speak English. The crew were professional attentive and friendly. Seats were excellent better than the Asiana Business Class which I took 3 weeks prior. The noise-cancelling headsets given gave me painful ears after a while though. This was the first time I used their headsets as I used to carry my own - room for improvement on that. While everything else worked perfectly the privacy screen was stuck and took a strapping male FA some effort to take out. Food was very good except for dessert where the Chocolate Truffle Cake for dessert was disappointingly dry and hard. We enjoyed both the Japanese and the Western options. Food was served upon being airborne which was about 11am so it was rather early for lunch. When we asked for some fruits for snacks (or anything really) at around 3pm the FA said they did not have any food left and offered us mixed nuts instead. Perhaps SQ should stock up on snack items?
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,HND-SIN-CGK on A330-300 and B777-200 (retrofitted) respectively. First leg Tokyo-HND to Singapore-SIN morning flight. Very generous volume and options of food and drinks. I always like the Singapore Sling cocktail by the way. Second leg retrofitted B777-200 from Singapore to Jakarta. Tasty fruit platter and excellent hot towel service as always.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,,3,yes,7,AKL-SIN-LHR-SIN-MEL in Economy using points redemption. Comfortable enough flight on all legs legroom good in economy and service typically robotic and boring. IFE excellent. No issue with inflight as they are definitely good. No recognition whatsoever for status despite my partner spending significant sums with this airline but no surprises there as this is the usual procedure with Singapore Airlines these days. Lounge in Singapore not good. On a long haul flight such as this there are no showering amenities. I realise for Business and First travellers this is available in SilverKris lounge but in KrisFlyer Gold not. The lounge is very basic and as their hub being Changi I had expected more. Food options were lacklustre and overall quite disappointing. The flight itself however couldn't fault and arrived feeling fairly refreshed at either end but their lounges at all destinations where SQ operated are always fairly average. LHR SIN MEL all initially come to mind.
,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,7,Took an Airbus 330 SIN-KIX on 29 June 2014. Flight departed and arrived on time. Service was average - good but not excellent. Perhaps it has to do with the full load. Aircraft was alternating between very cold and very hot throughout the flight. Restrooms were clean IFE working perfectly and food was standard. The major flaw was the seat pitch. Couldn't remember the last time I took SQ's A330 but the seat pitch was way smaller than even ANA Domestic which I took twice during this trip. It was very cramped.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Jakarta - Singapore - Milan July 9-10. Everything fine cabin crew excellent as always. Still my favourite airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,I flew from Zurich to Jakarta via Singapore all flights were on time and friendly attentive cabin crew they really give attention to passengers. Seat was very comfortable and the entertainment was great enough for a 12 hour flight but the flight path was not as informative as before. First flight from Zurich to Singapore had horrible seafood menu as I ordered before and the fourth flight from Singapore to Zurich the problem was the entertainment system - we couldn't see the flight path and the audio or video was stuck every few minutes. I did try the Wi-Fi onboard. I think $5.99 for 5 MB was far too expensive and the connection was slow. Other than that every aspect was went very well (check in boarding transit baggage handling).
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,2,no,7,SQ285 from SIN to AKL. Despite a full flight service was good. Flight steward were attended to fulfil my request very soon after the bell was pressed. But disappointed over the ageing aircraft. SQ ticket price definitely not in the lower bracket but the 777-300 cabinet condition and facilities were just too old when comparing to other carriers.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,LAX - Singapore via Tokyo. Entertainment system in the new Airbus A380 was excellent had all new movies. Service was good they had hot towels and many choices of food. The headphones weren't working well I could only hear from one side. Seats were pretty small for a new aircraft but overall satisfying.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,SQ 218 from Melbourne to Singapore on a Boeing 777-300ER. Renowned Singapore Girls were friendly and exemplary. A passenger seated next to me spilled her orange juice on my lap and they courteously offered wet towels to me when I requested for them. Food was great and Krisworld was amazing as usual.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Flew SIA business class Christchurch - Singapore - Istanbul and then London - Singapore - Auckland. Staff service was superb. My only negatives are the smallish TV screens and rather overly warm cabin.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew BNE-SIN return in Economy class. All flights departed and arrived on time. Aircraft was modern and clean A330 with nice interior. Seats were not the most comfortable and felt a bit cramped. IFE was very good user friendly. The cabin crew are wonderful very helpful kind and courteous. Food was of high quality however the continental breakfast was a let down. All kinds of amenities were available and snacks provided on request. I did enjoy my trip with Singapore Airlines maybe a tad overrated. I feel other Asian airlines such as KE CX CI are just as good but still one of the best airlines you can fly!
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,3,yes,6,"Rome to Singapore SQ 365 on 27 June. We were advised at check-in that there had been a change of aircraft and our hearts sank when we boarded it was an ancient 777 surprised that Singapore Airlines still uses these dinosaurs. I have never experienced such old uncomfortable business class seats (you could select either seat recline or leg raise not both at the same time). I am only 5 ft 4"" and I felt scrunched up. There was no storage around the seat area for personal belongings on this very old plane really not good enough for a five star airline on a long haul route. No mattress over the seats as you get with Qantas and no amenities pack (only slippers and eye shade). The only saving grace were the crew they were exemplary fantastic in fact and the meals were fantastic. If only the aircraft matched the wonderful service on board."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,Dubai-Singapore-Perth. Very disappointing. What has happened to Singapore Airlines? The standard of the aircraft was just not up to today's standards and that's not because I usually fly Emirates which is in another class altogether compared to this flight at the same price! The whole interior of the aircraft was that of the 1980's. The seats were old and didn't function properly entertainment screen was tiny dim (even on full brightness) and blurry. I flew economy but felt sorrier for business class where seats looked like they were out of the 1970’s. Yes there are some other airlines that are as bad but you pay for what you get and this flight was not cheap. Note: even low cost airlins these days have new fresh interiors albeit basic.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,SQ919 MNL-SIN 24th June 2014. From check-in to deboarding the plane check-in personnel were good. Excellent customer service inflight meals were great. Singapore Airlines Cabin Crew are the best too. Will fly them anytime anywhere.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,3,no,4,Singapore to Auckland SQ281 777-200. Can't believe Singapore still use this aircraft it desperately needs an overhaul tiny 6 inch displays no touch even with full brightness I was struggling switched to using my tablet instead. Seat rests do go fully up. Service was poor this time around Food normally in economy is ok to good this wasn't. Not a nice way to come back to NZ. will consider other options.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,MEL-JFK over three separate legs. Encountered crews ranging from good to excellent on these flights. Catering was mainly Book the Cook and very good (FRA food is never as good as most other ports). Choice of DOM or Krug and great wine selection. SQ are still close to perfect in first class.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,The plane seemed to be extremely old and in need of upgrade. Flight SQ0324 Friday 6th June. In the past I have always praised Singapore Airlines for having more room in Economy than any other airline - I was evidently very wrong and I guess lucky in the past. I had bruises on my leg where I had squeezed out of my seat to go to the bathroom - the passenger in front had reclined his seat and I couldn't get out of my seat easily. Flight was so bad I cancelled my flight home with Singapore (and lost the money) rather than suffer that trip again I flew back to Melbourne with Qatar.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew 30th May London - Singapore - Bali. First leg on the A380 double decker second leg Boeing 777200 series. Return flight 14th June as above but Singapore to London to our disappointment the aircraft was changed to a Boeing 777 300er series much prefer the A380. Cannot fault the service staff very polite did their job well - we were given plenty of drinks during the flight. Seating and legroom good with good choice of entertainment. All flights very punctual.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,7th June SIN-BKK 10th June BKK-SIN. Both were on A330s with on time arrivals. Something seems different with SQ now; The cabin crew now exude character and warmth. They're quick to start a quick conversation with you and go the extra mile to make sure that your flight is comfortable. Definitely heading back to being one of the best airlines in the world. Keep it up Singapore Airlines! Indeed a great way to fly.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,DPS-Singapore 28 May 2014. Excellent flight and service. Friendly and efficient staff. B777-200. Singapore - Amsterdam 28 May 2014 B777-200. Although old aircraft again very pleasant and comfortable. Staff very good. Flatbeds - we slept very well. Great flights great airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,5,I normally take China Airlines for my monthly flight from Surabaya to Singapore. I found that the departure time is nice but the return time is far too early in the morning so my travel agent advised me to use SIA sister company Silk Air for the return. Expecting something special as I'm paying more money I didn't find anything special except the extra amenities. The so called Singapore Ladies/stewardess that are heavily advertised are nothing special. Please prepare to be disappointed.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,,,2,no,4,Flight SQ 308 9th June 2014. The worst business Class seat too wide no support hard as a rock. You can't sit comfortably in any position and it is pathetic to lie on. My back actually aching on arrival. Never again. Food lousy choice too small service without a smile and even then only when you asked. No pyjamas SIN to London and one meal served with no cloth at all. Used to be great. Flying back Emirates and saving $1250 per seat on top.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,3,yes,9,CGK-SIN SQ 967 / SIN-NRT SQ 638. CGK-SIN with a retrofitted 777-200. It has always been nice that SIA has meal options other than standard meal. I opted for fruit platter and everything was tasty. Smooth take-off and landing arrived SIN on time for connecting flight to Tokyo-NRT. SIN-NRT leg on B777-300ER with brand new interior. Tasty refreshment breakfast superb touch-screen IFE ergonomic seat comfy headrest. Two thumbs up as always!
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,1,no,5,ICN-SIN-BNE. Both flights very poor service offered by staff if you could find them! ICN-SIN did not see flight attendants for a full hour after take off no offer of any drinks before take off or after. Poor selection of lunch offered - Braised beef with lentils! Staff hid behind curtain no offer of refills during a 5 hour flight. SIN-BNE - FA's were rude midnight flight there was no offer of any snacks during 8 hour flight and made to feel I was an inconvenience when asking for a drink. Breakfast meal (received 6 hours into flight) was rubbish. Have flown Economy with Singapore and it was fine. I thought flying Business Class was going to be an amazing experience -it was just terrible. Rude staff and poor service. Will never fly with them again as it was such a waste (of a lot) of money!
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LHR-BNE always had a slight fear of flying before this trip! This was by far the best service I have received on an airline. Any long haul flights I make in the future will always be with Singapore.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,We flew from LHR - Singapore - Brisbane - Cairns then the same return journey. In general the service was good and we all enjoyed the food very much. There was a problem on the route from Singapore to Brisbane in that our seats were in the centre block and for some reason the crew kept missing us first we got no food (they ran out just as they got to us then started serving people around us but not us) and in spite of several attempts to get their attention they ignored us. Eventually my husband had to go down and ask them for food. The stewardess was very apologetic. I also noticed that when seatbelt checks were done on that flight they didn't actually look along our row. I witnessed a couple of people pressing the Call button and getting no response at least for quite a while. On the same flight the entertainment monitors were unreliable. Mine didn't have sound for a while and my son's just stopped working. The other legs of our journey were quite good and I was impressed that our luggage reached our final destination efficiently. I did find the legroom a bit cramped but that was more to do with the pillows and blankets. The main problem on the final leg of our return journey was a child a couple of rows behind us that just cried incessantly for almost 16 hours. Being a night flight we'd hoped to sleep most of the way but the whole section of the plane around the child was kept awake. There seemed to be no bassinets on our flight so no doubt the child had to try to get comfortable sitting on parents lap? The crew were no doubt also affected by the crying but what can anyone do in such a situation?
,,,First Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,2,no,2,Singapore Airlines in its heydays was the service and efficiency pacesetter amongst international airlines. Unfortunately it has lost much of its shine and has reduced itself to relying on price advantage to survive the onslaught by more progressive truly international airlines which are more in tune with today's international travellers. Case in point: during my last 2 trips from Melbourne to Singapore and back on First and Business Class 1) Cabin crews lack communication and English language skills most are not able to carry a decent mature conversation. 2) Male crews lack discipline and female crews rushing around like pre-programmed robots without genuine warmth. 3) Filthy leather seats and the lack of general cleanliness show up an ageing tired airline. 4) Second rate food even in First with badly stocked kitchens without essentials such as Soy milk for coffee and fresh chilli sauce for food. And the list goes on. Wake up Singapore the world has moved on.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,I flew SIA (B777-300ER) from Houston to Singapore (return) it was great. However for the first trip I ordered the seafood meal. It was very disappointing. One of the seafood meals (breakfast) was just eggs and a little bacon (it looked like a low calorie meal). On my return trip I opted for regular meals all were satisfactory. I will never order seafood meals from SIA.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew on SQ856 SIN-HKG 388 and SQ871 HKG-SIN 772. The A380 was excellent as it's a brand new aircraft with new comfy seats and more legroom. Also the crew provides excellent service for my family. Food was pretty decent but the IFE could be improved. The return leg was an old 777-200ER. The service is as usual the SIA high standards and the interior and seats are well- maintained and not worn out despite being an old aircraft. In overall the entire experience with Singapore Airlines journey was splendid and worth the money will definitely fly the carrier again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,MNL-SIN return with 3 kids. Fantastic airline despite using old equipment (777-200) for the regional route. Kids meals very tasty that even my daughter who is a very picky eater had no problems finishing the generous portions. Specialised headsets for the kids as well as some activity materials too. IFE acceptable and adequate to keep the young ones entertained for the 3 hour flight. Well worth the money.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,SYD-MNL-SYD. Our first sector from Sydney to Singapore was good seat comfort was good food was good for economy IFE was average since it wasn't the SIA KrisWorld flagship system. Singapore to Manila was good flight A330 full flight. Security and boarding was slow (typical for Manila bound flights however) however it was SIA's Economy product seen on the A380. Returning back to Sydney the Singapore to Manila leg was on a older B777 aircraft with an old IFE system with loop programming food was good and seat comfort was good. Our final leg to Sydney was on an A380 on the upper deck. The flight wasn't full and the cabin crew during pushback invited us to come downstairs and check out an empty row so we got a row to ourselves and it was a very comfortable trip back to Sydney. IFE was good food was good however a bit disappointed with the continental breakfast which was essentially a fruit and muffin. Service overall was excellent same high standard that Singapore Airlines provides and the flights ran on time some flights arriving earlier than scheduled. Price was great and would definitely recommend SIA to anyone travelling.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,MEL-SIN - 777-300ER. The flight was ok but the service was amazing! The food was good the seat was good. It was a red-eye flight that was 7hrs and only 1:30hrs of sleep - it took 2:30hrs for dinner and 2hrs for breakfast. I would recommend that Singapore Airlines should do short meal services for red-eye flights.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,London to Sydney LHR/SIN on the 777-300ER with new business class and SIN/SYD on the A380-800 with the older business product. The food and service was superb. I used book the cook for both legs lamb chops on the second leg were memorable. Champagne was Bollinger. The new business seats are excellent but suffer from the requirement to place ones feet in a small pocket to sleep diagonally. If you can get the bulkhead seats do so as this avoids the problem. I got bulkhead seats for the second leg on the A380. SIA do not offer sleeping suits in business.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,,2,no,4,"I was very disappointed by the Singapore Airlines business class travel experienced recently. My partner and I flew from Australia to Europe and back with Singapore Airlines three sectors on the A380 and one on a B777. Surprisingly the B777 provided the more comfortable experience despite the lack of a fully flat bed. The seats on the A380 are extremely wide (which was the initial draw card and the reason for spending $1500 more than for Cathay Pacific) but you have to sit in them diagonally to reach the foot rest - this was comfortable for about 5 minutes. The beds in the fully flat position are quite comfortable but unlike other business class seats there is no smooth transition from sitting to lying - you are required to 'make' the bed. When in the bed position there is no comfortable backrest to allow you to sit comfortably - hence the large number of business travellers seen sitting cross-legged in bed throughout the flight! Furthermore the seats are leather but are very worn sometimes damaged and the headrests do not stay in position. There are no individual amenities kits (just an eye mask and some slippers) - a selection of items are available in the toilet cubicles. There are no pyjamas as on some other airlines. The service was highly variable. The worst sector by far was from Singapore to Heathrow. The staff were anything but attentive the bathrooms were unclean and food was dreadful. Garlic bread was cold and rock hard and the ""Book the Cook"" proved to be extremely disappointing. The lobster thermidore was a complete let-down and looked nothing like the pictures posted online by the airline and other travellers. The nut-encrusted veal was unfortunately the toughest and coldest piece of meal I have had on a flight and the ""crust"" was more like a soggy coating. That said the meals that were not pre-ordered were generally of very high quality. The entertainment system was excellent. Having previous travelled in Business Class with Qantas and Cathay Pacific I would not hesitate to return to these two in preference to Singapore Airlines in future."
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,KUL-Singapore-Dubai and return. The seat were spacious with good storage spaces but a bit dated due wear and tear. Crews were attentive food served was generous and the entertainment selection was good.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Service standards are disappointing. My flight was on SQ 298 from Christchurch to Singapore in general for the price of the ticket I expected much better. Food was very poor. For someone with high tolerance in salty food the Chinese dinner meal (rice with pork in gravy) was very salty. Lamb stew served for lunch was undercooked. Choice of meals ran out for both lunch and dinner and entertainment systems were surprisingly outdated (compared to other airlines with touch screen and consoles SIA only had old fashioned consoles). Air stewardesses were decent but not the most helpful or courteous. Having flown SIA and other airlines like Emirates and even budget carriers in recent years I find that the standard of SIA has been poorly maintained and sad to say even though I am a Singaporean who would want to support the main airline of our small country the substandard flight service and appalling customer service I experienced this flight definitely does not live up to the price of its reputation and premium airline tickets. I would not be flying Singapore Airlines again.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Excellent carrier everything is excellent. Steward/Stewardess are very polite and when I entered the aircraft I had a sense that everything is going to be excellent. Meals are excellent and captain announcements were very clear and aircraft cabin was new and modern.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Quick business trip involving 4 long haul sectors on SQ. AKL-SIN-AMS-CPH-SIN-AKL. First two on 777-300ER and return on 777-200ER. As always fabulous and consistent service and quality all round. SQ is refitting their 777-200ER fleet with decent Business class seats similar to those fitted to the 300's and A380's but they still have 4 or 5 aircraft's not yet done. Unfortunately I got one sector with one of these and they are bad after you've experienced their newer product. If you are unlucky enough to get one of these you probably won't know until you board see the seats and get that sinking feeling! Looking forward to them finishing the job as they appear to be using the old ones to NZ a lot!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew LHR to MNL - to give some context I've done pretty much every route to Manila in recent years usually based on price at the time. I found Singapore Airlines still to be a cut above the rest - but not perfect - and wouldn't hesitate to use again. Main leg on way out was on a modern 777 very nice and clearly more space than competition due to 3-3-3 layout - food all good and I can't remember any other carrier proactively offering so many drinks and refills in Economy. However the Singapore to Manila leg (and same coming back) was a much older 777 cabin with mediocre screens etc. Still no complaints as the equivalent leg on Malaysian (comparable due to distance) is on a real shocker of a 737. On way back my video screen was down for the whole flight and the staff asked me to stay behind to speak to the customer service team at Changi for 'compensation' - they gave me some kind of wallet which was a nice touch but not worth waiting behind on an empty plane for. Singapore to London on A380 upstairs - great flight and great space. All 4 flights were delayed which was frustrating but hey not the airlines' fault. Generally - the long haul legs very impressive the shorter flights average but overall far better than any other route to the Philippines. One frustration is security rules at the gate at Changi - confiscating water bought 2 minutes before at the airport which seems excessive.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,LHR-SIN. Check-in agent was extremely helpful - even though I was travelling on a reward ticket issued by TACA and booked through Avianca (a tortuous provenance one would expect to preclude changes) I asked at check-in if I could take the later 2230 flight instead of the 2100 I was booked on so I could get more work done in the lounge before the flight (and also as I prefer A380 to 777-300ER). Not only did he manage to do this but having done so he realised my bag had already been tagged and sent down the chute so printed a new tag gave me my travel documents then raced off to intercept my bag and re-tag it somewhere in the bowels of T3. Amazing effort (and obviously successful as my bag indeed made it on the right flight). SAS lounge pretty good nice view of the airfield action. Onboard SQ were using the hi-J config A380 with business class taking up the entire upper deck. My window seat was the last row and on it’s own between the rear exit just ahead and the galley just behind. Service was very nice as usual from SQ and again dispelled the myth that they are smiling robots as I had several nice conversations with different members of the crew. Food was a bit of a letdown (seafood and rice dish very bland) but the bed is so good it’s almost too comfortable - I slept so well that I had awful jetlag for a week arriving at 6pm incredibly refreshed left me hideously out of synch with the local time zone. I will manage my sleep patterns better and ask for some spicy sauce on the side of my main next time but SQ remain one of the best in the air.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,In the last 2 weeks I flew from Perth to Singapore to Johannesburg back to Singapore then to Hong Kong from Hong Kong back to Singapore and finally home to Perth! All with Singapore Airlines. Every flight was quite simply the best I have experienced. I actually found myself looking forward to a meal on a plane. All aspects were fast efficient friendly and professional. Economy seats on the 777 are far better than any other airline I have flown IFE was very good with a wide selection all flights on time and onboard staff very good. Quite simply I can see why they are always rated so highly.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,We have been Silver Krisflyer members for 15 years at least and just flew Johannesburg to Singapore SQ479 26 Apr and Singapore to Brisbane SQ235 27 Apr and the disinterested and offhand manner of the staff was very noticeable. The females with one exception were unsmiling and almost snatched trays from us. During meal service flight attendants in the past always ensured the comfort of passenger dining by requesting the seats be upright but on these two flights I had to ask that this be done. Also there was a huge rush to get a stone cold awful breakfast served before landing in Brisbane - why? Then they missed the fact that a passenger in front still had his seat reclined for landing. We noticed similar problems on a return Europe flight last year.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,SQ222 SYD to SIN on Airbus 380 punctual take-off excellent in-flight service great seat cabin crews were very friendly and attentive. Singapore Airlines is a class above others!
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Singapore Changi to Guangzhou Baiyun return. Stewardess were attentive and polite. Hot towel upon arrival. Food was excellent. Seats were comfortable. Good serving time and the drinks were great. Power sockets were found on the seats great for my laptop! Something that I have not seen on my previous trip to Taiwan with the local airlines there. Everything was taken care off and you know that you are in good hands.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Left Heathrow on 21st February stopping in Singapore for 1.5 hours before flight to Auckland. I had the pleasure of flying for the first time not only to New Zealand from Heathrow but with Singapore Airlines. I just had to write to say how excellent my flying time was. I was made to feel safe secure welcome and as if I was the only passenger on the plane. Nothing was too much trouble. The staff were immaculate in all areas of appearance. A great flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,3,yes,8,Singapore to San Francisco on 26 April 2014 which was a full flight. Before take off it seemed that some passengers were not assigned seats but the ground and cabin crew were on top of sorting things out. Food from Singapore to Hong Kong was pretty good but the food from Hong Kong to San Francisco was quite disappointing.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flight 25 April 19 2014 and Flight 26 on April 27 2014. My wife and I have flown Singapore Airlines before and have always been more than satisfied with every aspect of the flight. This trip was even better than in the past. The crew on both flights were exceptionally helpful since my wife had hip surgery recently and needed extra attention. We were accommodated at every turn during the flight. The American carriers could learn a lot from Singapore Airlines.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,We are long time Kris flyers our flights SQ 224 and SQ 866 7 April 2014 Perth - Singapore Singapore - Hong Kong there were no problems as was SQ 805 22 April 2014. Beijing - Singapore however SQ 223 25 April 2014 Singapore - Perth what a shambles full flight cabin staff were more interested in 'special meals etc'. Eventually after a 1.5 hour delay we were served lunch you read about staff not answering call button this happened to us eventually our call was answered there was definitely a problem. No coffee and tea was brought around eventually my husband took our meal trays down to the back galley only to be met with oh! We forgot! On leaving the aircraft - there was not one cabin crew member to be seen.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,Travelled Denpasar (Bali) to Singapore on SQ 943. This was a great flight. Gracious and charming service on a 7 year old 777-200 in the old configuration with comfy armchair style recliners. Delicious beef steak with great red wine and champagne. The cabin crew were professional and friendly. The IFE was very old fashioned but that was the only demerit otherwise excellent.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,SQ-011 Tokyo NRT to Singapore SIN on Airbus A380-800. Almost all seats on the economy class were occupied but FAs stayed professional and smart. Effective F&B services clean cabin good amenities acceptable IFE options. Two thumbs-up for SIA as always.
,,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,"I am a Kris Flyer ""Silver Elite"" member and I have recently travelled the Suites from Hong Kong to Singapore. I enjoyed every moment of the flight. A nice glass of bubbles (Dom Perignon) was offered before take off. The cabin crews were very attentive and helpful on every aspect of my flight. The food was more than adequate for me. A nice touch when a head cabin service officer apologized to me about the delay when the flight took off behind schedule from HKG was due to late arrival to HKG from Singapore. I'll recommend this airline."
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,I have been on many business class trips all lovely but Singapore Airlines tops them all. Their cabin crew are friendly and always smiling the meals were excellent the seat was huge and IFE was excellent. The lounge in Singapore was the best I have been in. For the 25 hours it took to get from Sydney to Paris I enjoyed every second what I liked the most was the express passes at Sydney International Airport skipping the queue at customs. I don't usually fly on business trips with the kids but they loved it too!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,Flew with family ICN-SIN-DPS and back. Food was very tasty (for economy standard). Entertainment selection is very extensive. Cabin crew service and safety attitude is above standard. All flights were on time.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,no,2,Singapore to London Heathrow on 17th April 2014 at 11.30pm. The best seats on any airline would be in a child free cabin having just returned on another flight having to endure 13 hours listening to a screaming child I think all airlines should ensure children/infants are in a separate cabin.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I am a fairly new traveller with Singapore with 7 trips in 2014 usually from Singapore to and from my homeland India or my office in Germany. Today returned from my short Easter vacation with a round trip Pune-Mumbai- Singapore in Business class on 421 and 422. Spacious seats with extendable leg space for sleeping. Excellent Service - offered blankets and head rest within minutes. They serve the best inflight fresh food. You must not miss their 'Book the Cook' option and their speciality is the delicious Lobster Thermidor. Staff pronounced my difficult name correctly and the stewardess offered to fill in my landing visa form my luggage was already towed in advance to my waiting car so I wont have to wait at the terminal after my flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,SQ 321-31/3/14 SQ 297- 1/4/14 SQ 298 - 17/4/14 SQ 308 - 18/4/14. Just returned from a trip to New Zealand and was very impressed with the level of service and efficiency. I would have no hesitation in travelling with Singapore Airline again or in recommending them to others.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flight 305 1/3/14. I have flown with them before but quite few years ago so assumed they would of gone downhill like so many airlines but what a pleasant surprise nothing had changed! Great service from the cabin crew comfortable seating really nice food and best of all a brilliant IFE system. I have flown with Cathay Pacific and Malaysian a lot and they are good but no where near the same class as Singapore.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,This is my second time travelling with SQ. This time it was HKG-LHR with a transit in Singapore (SQ856 and SQ306). The trip was excellent in all respects especially the catering and the seat which has footrests unlike CX (which I found to be much needed on 13 hour flights). However the transit in Changi was confusing as it is against convention in the way that arrivals and departures are in the same area and I was trying to find somewhere to go through immigration again which turns out to be at the gate itself. Also the A380's on both trips had a good variety in their IFE despite not being touch screen because the remote controller was not always responsive. I loved the rear economy section on the upper deck of the A380 it was cosy and small meaning less noise and less people knocking against you when you are trying to go to the galley or bathroom. The purser was great trying desperately to look for the other meal option from the downstairs cabin after it ran out on the upper deck. In a nutshell a well deserved 5 star airline and something that is a class above Emirates.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Just completed a return trip BKK-IST in biz class on 777-200 retro fitted. What a great way to fly! Service was excellent got addressed by name on all 4 sectors and food was generally high standard overall. We tried the 'Book the Cook' Service and ordered their famous Lobster Thermidor. It was very good. The waffles unfortunately were terrible. The seat itself is very wide and not too bad for sleeping if you sleep diagonally. It was my first time in the seats and I didn't realise that the seat back didn't go back flat the full width of the seat. Perhaps the only disappointing thing would be the KrisWorld Entertainment System - it wasn't as extensive in selection of movies as say Cathay Pacific. The lounges were very good especially the Turkish Airlines one in Istanbul - incredible!!! This was a FF Points trip -if only we could afford to fly like this all the time.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,I travelled using Singapore Airlines on the weekend returning from Phuket and I must say I am nothing but impressed. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly the plane itself was comfortable having ample room to stretch out (with two children that can be a bit hard). The flight was smooth and comfortable. I would highly recommend using them I have used them previously and have always been happy with their service.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew from Melbourne to Singapore on a Boeing 777-300ER. Entertainment options available were aplenty. Excellent service from the cabin crew. Who knew this tiny little country could produce one of the world's best airlines. Can't wait to fly with them again soon!
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Manchester UK - Munich - Singapore - Brisbane and same for return. Very friendly crew very welcoming and helpful. Hot towels before take off nice food and a good range of snacks available at any time. Good range of TV programmes and films that keep you entertained. Blankets socks and headphones provided on each flight. Seats not particularly big with only slightly more leg room than a short haul flight but still fairly comfortable. Always on time with no problems/delays. Overall a great airline with a great service! Would definitely recommend.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,SYD-SIN-BKK return. SQ232 and 231 on A380 and SIN/BKK sectors on A330. Having flown with the rest I have now again flown with the best. Return flight SIN to SYD not full - was seated upstairs and upon request was granted exit row seats without fuss. Everything about these flights was near perfect and yet the fares paid were no different from the other airlines. Most pleasant relaxing flights with nothing more needing reporting. Definitely a cut above the rest.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,no,10,BKK-SIN 25th March. After having to endure a flight from Copenhagen to Bangkok with SAS Scandinavian Airlines the Singapore flight was like ascending from hell to heaven. The contrast could not have been greater. Wonderful service great food and excellent entertainment. Singapore Airlines really care about their customers and it shows. Definitely worth every penny and highly recommended.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,SIN-AKL 28th March. Very nice smooth flight. A printed menu good food a great entertainment system. The 777 is not the most spacious aircraft but never mind at least Singapore Airlines have the brains to stick to a 3x3x3 seating arrangement and do not push it to 3x4x3 like some others such as Air New Zealand do. (In my opinion there should be some international law that forbids this practice because the cramped isle compromises safety.) The service and entertainment made up for the lack of space so I would still rate it as a 5 star experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,SIN-DXB-SIN. Both were on the B777-300ER series. Adequate legroom and good IFE to keep me entertained throughout the flight. As usual the service was up to standard professional and efficient but Singapore Airlines service tends to lag the warmth and personable service despite being efficient and professional. That being said a worthwhile flight on both leg under Singapore Airlines and I will recommend to choose Singapore Airline compared to Emirates for this route.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,LHR-SIN-SYD and return. A380 for the first and third legs B777 for the second and fourth. Booked early enough to get the upstairs economy cabin for the A380 flights seats in rows of two with a storage bin on the window side. Only quibble which is trivial is that the library of movies and audio books wasn't that great. Helpful cabin crew rebooted non-functioning IFE very promptly on one leg. Fruit option for meals excellent. Hot towels and regular juice/water supplies much appreciated and the service across the board could not be faulted - the crews seem highly efficient anyway but it helps that there are enough staff for them not to get irritable through needing to work at breakneck pace. We've done this journey with Qantas when they flew Heathrow-Sydney Singapore but switched because a Dubai-Sydney leg is just too long. T3 at Changi is an oasis of calm compared to Dubai and if you book flights with a medium layover you can be asleep in the airside transit hotel minutes after landing. A definite choice of airline and route when we next make the trip.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,SQ942 from Singapore to Denpasar: service was friendly food was good - had no problems with the flight. SQ943 from Denpasar to Singapore: service was cold they had only one meal option left by the time they got to me (thankfully it tasted good). Wondering if SQ has done away with the kids' activity packs because my kids were not given any and I had to ask for the kid-sized headphones for them on both legs.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,We recently travelled business class return to Auckland via Singapore. We used both the 777 and airbus 380. What an experience! A lovely huge flat bed an excellent choice of food and wines and amazing service. How they managed to provide such excellent food 32000 feet up was mind boggling! The stewards and stewardesses were so helpful and friendly nothing was too much trouble. They may charge more than some other airlines but they are well worth the money. They will always be my airline of choice!
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,"The best business class I've experienced. JFK to FRA on an A380. Luxury product with Givenchy amenities: blanket pillows table linens cutlery tableware etc. Food of very good quality ordered one of the ""Book the Chef"" options impressive beverage selection with a large list of cocktails as a plus! The crew is the key here simply one of the best in-flight experiences ever! They know their product and how to enhance it! Always adressed me with my last name and always with a genuine smile."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Anticipating a good experience on this well reputed airline I was not at all disappointed. Flying A380 on LAX- NRT-SIN route the service was consistently good attentive several menu items and literary numerous (more than 400 movies alone) entertainment options; the only discomfort was the temperature somehow SQ insisted on keeping the cabin quite cold. But overall great service and experience.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,,,3,yes,5,I've been travelling with SA for many years each year a trip from UK to Australia via Singapore some years 2 trips. In addition I've travelled with them from UK to Indonesia via Singapore many times. I think I've been to Singapore around 90 or so times. I've seen terminal 123 all built and improve their great standards. I have huge admiration for Singapore. But in recent years I feel S Airlines has cut and cut its standards. Sadly they seem to be steadily slipping down in standards as they expand. It used to be easy to contact SA and change bookings add trips etc. But now it's a major hassle to get into contact. The food (I travel economy class) is truly awful. It used to be OK. I don't eat a great deal or care a great deal about food but the stuff served up is inedible! I saw many meals barely touched. The cabin staff are pleasant as always but it's definitely harder for them. The planes were pretty much on time (as usual). On my last trip the particular check-in staff at Sydney were great (our bags were mistagged and they sorted it out well) and I think it reflects their character: I'm sure these people are always good. The ground ticketing staff in Singapore were rather incompetent. I wanted a business class side trip to Indonesia. It took about 4 staff to look into it for half an hour and they said none were available. I went economy anyway and found every seat in business class empty. (I look respectable honestly!).
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,,,3,no,7,I've just come back from a UK - Perth return trip. I first used them two years ago when I went UK - Auckland return and at that time I could not fault them in anyway this time my experience was different. The food was awful I'm not a person that's fussy about food but every meal was awful. The staff as always were great but you have to ask for everything now that's not standard such as a beer! Don't get me wrong they will get you one but you have to ask before they would ask you. The pillows were dirty god knows with what but you wouldn't put your head on one. I cant put my finger on it but the planes all four were tired. Maybe just a case that they are cutting back the same as everyone else but to me there's no excuse for such poor meals. 3 of us travelled and all of us thought the same.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,SQ912 SIN-MNL 13/3/2014. Trip was on a refitted B777-200ER registration 9V-SVG. Actual time inflight was 3hrs 5mins. There was a delay in moving off but captain kept passengers well informed. Service was fantastic as usual better than on the return leg since crew were still fresh from rest. Drinks service was basic and I still prefer a full drinks cart being pushed out rather than a tray of juices water beer and white wine. Food was so-so. Had a choice between braised beef with fried rice and fish with potatoes. I had fish while my companion had the beef. My fish dish was disappointing with not much taste to the fish. Vegetables tasted fine. Starter was a bit on the dry side. Dessert was heavenly. My companion said the beef tasted good. Other than that I asked for 3 cocktails and all of which were honoured with a smile. They didn't seem to think of this as a chore. Cabin crew were helpful and joked with some passengers. IFE is a little dated since they used the old IFE but with bigger screens. Seats pretty wide and legroom was standard. Aisle seats are bad as they had an IFE box below. Fortunately the flight was only 70% full and I switched to the 2nd seat. In conclusion this trip is value for money and good service like always from SQ.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,SQ919 MNL-SIN 18/3/2014. Trip was on a refitted B777-200ER registration 9V-SVJ. Actual time inflight was 3hrs 5mins or so. Took off earlier than schedule which was great. Service was good as usual. Crew seem tired since I didn't see any crew change taking place. Drinks service was basic and I still prefer a full drinks cart being pushed out rather than a tray of juices water beer and white wine. Food was great. Had a choice between pork with BBQ flavoured rice and chicken with pasta. I had the pork while my companion had the chicken. My pork dish was excellent with tender pork cubes and vegetables were done right. The rice was a little dry maybe due to overheating. Dessert was bad tasted nothing like mango cream cake. My companion said the chicken tasted good though portions are minuscule. Other than that I asked for 3 cocktails and all of which were honoured. Cabin crew on this leg didn't smile as much understandable due to exhaustion. IFE is a little dated since they used the old IFE but with bigger screens fortunately still AVOD. Seats pretty wide and legroom was standard 32 inches. Aisle seats are bad as they had an IFE box below. The flight was full. I tried asking for souvenirs and was given postcards and playing cards with a smile this time. In conclusion this trip is value for money and good service like always from SQ.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew Brisbane to Singapore on 14th March sitting in row 57. The service was first class the flight supervisor remembering details of passengers and while remaining professional communicated with a sense of humour and friendliness. The food was as good as any restaurant with good size portions. Inflight entertainment was first class plenty of choice for everyone to keep occupied.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,We have just returned from Asia and this was the first time we had flown with Singapore airlines. Having contacted their customer services before our flight I have to say the service was excellent. We travelled on a A380 airbus and we sat upstairs. Comfort leg room food and service during our flight were better than we have experienced with any other airline. We travelled to Bangkok via Singapore and our return was from Hanoi via Singapore. We sat in 78ac and 72 ac on our return. The service was excellent. Our luggage was transferred to our final destination. All staff on the flight were kind helpful and made the journey a pleasure. Well done Singapore Airlines we would definitely fly with them again.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,3,yes,6,SQ175 HAN-SIN on March 9 2014 seat 16D Airbus A330 300. Pros: nice food and wine very good entertainment and service. Cons: although seat is indicated full flat it is not possible for aircraft designed for short distance. Relatively low choice of magazines no menu for food they only show it to you very briefly. Very small overhead locker even my specially designed cabin luggage would not fit into any locker of the ATR 72. Slightly chaotic situation if you change seats at check-in.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,2,no,5,Flew Manchester to Sydney via Munich and Singapore and then same route on return. I had heard positive things about Singapore Airlines but to be honest I was quite disappointed. The service was better than rival airlines but was not fantastic. At least they did offer drinks at frequent intervals. The seats were uncomfortable and the cabin temperature was cold. On the outgoing Singapore/Sydney sector it was really far too cold. The food was absolutely awful. I ordered a vegetarian meal and except for the meal out of Sydney it was virtually inedible. If you have a nut allergy don't fly with this airline as packets of nuts are given out freely. I'm not sure if I would fly with SA again.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,2,no,3,Outbound and return flight from Singapore to Taipei in economy class. Flights were seriously delayed both ways without giving passengers due prior notification. On the outbound leg in Singapore we sat in the plane for about 2 hours before we could take off. On-board service was so-so and the food was virtually inedible. No wonder everyone seemed to have ordered a special meal.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,A380 LHR to SIN ok seats less comfortable than original seating plan. Inflight entertainment faulty but viewable. Boeing 777-200 to Christchurch on tired and dated planes. Terrible seats and 17 inch. Return journey no inflight entertainment for >40 seats from take off. After 9 hours rebooted system as IFE had now gone down in business also. Poor that it was now clear the problem could have been solved sooner if they were at all bothered. Terrible customer service. Boeing 777-300 new touch screens but the plane noise is so loud almost impossible to hear the movies when sat just behind wing. No snacks offered during 13 hour flight. Not recommended.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,3,yes,8,Singapore to Zurich on A380 - overall good. Good selection of food option flight had some turbulence. Frankfurt to Singapore on A380. Again good selection of food options and flight had no turbulence.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LHR-SIN - return. Another great flight with Singapore Airlines on A380. The crew were all friendly and served drinks throughout the flight. My vegetarian special meals were tasty - one of the best I have had. Good choice of programs on TV.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,no,4,Economy Class from Surabaya to Singapore on Feb 23. SQ operates A330 on this route. Seating arrangement is 2x4x2. We were given the middle section (4 seats) as we traveled with one child and one infant. The seats were comfortable enough with generous leg room. Food was not as tasty as Silk Air and only one option left at that time when the FA served me. Very disappointing! All in all still unhappy with the SIA in-flight services I personally think the services are going downhill.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,8,Flew from LHR-SIN on 18th Feb 2014 the majority of the crews on flight were outstanding except for one male crew who was a bit rude when I asked for a cup of noodles the initial response was that they didn't have anymore stock and breakfast would be served soon. Apart from this I was still satisfied with the staff service food and inflight entertainment.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,LHR to SIN on 15th Feb returning on 26th both legs on 777-200ER. Both legs with window seats. Staff and service excellent food (Asian option) choices excellent and delicious. Plentiful water juice and hot drinks between meals as well as light bites. Hot towels before each meal. IFE selection gargantuan with superb easy to use handset. Seats outbound far more comfortable than on the return sector. For service and inflight experiences one of the nicest I have enjoyed definitely the carrier of choice to South East Asia and Changi airport is a thing of beauty.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,SQ318 SIN to LHR 23 Feb A380-800 Business Class. Excellent flight in every respect. On time. Excellent service throughout. Top quality food and drink. The seat and bed were both extremely comfortable. Having flown out on Boeing 777 300 ER (see separate earlier report) with the compromised and uncomfortable new business class seat / bed I was surprised how much more comfortable the older seat / bed arrangement is on the A380. The only aspect that is not superior on the A380 is the screen which is larger and sharper on the 777 with the new business class. This was an excellent flight and I now know to try to pick Singapore flights with the A380 and to avoid the 777.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew on 22/2/14 from Brisbane to Singapore then onwards to Heathrow. The first flight was on a new A330-300 the second on an almost as new Boeing 777-300 ER. Both flights were just superb. The cabin crew as ever were attentive friendly and professional. The food on both flights was very good even though we were in cattle class. We have used them many times to Australia and they are always excellent.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,3,yes,6,Singapore-London on a B777. Flight was on time and the plane looked very clean the food was great and not many passengers in business class. FAs were very attentive and they were fast. I will fly with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,Flew Milan-Singapore-Chiang Mai and return Singapore Airlines + Silk Air aircraft. Costly ticket (worth 1000 EUR instead of 700/800 EUR of competitors') but you get uncrowded cabins and premium feeling both on-board and at S'pore airport. Gulf carriers cabin crew should really take classes from Singapore Airlines' staff!
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,MEL-SIN-NGO A330 J. Two perfect flights. Very comfortable seats. Fantastic crew who didn't forget a thing Bollinger champagne terrific meals (my Indian lamb shank ordered via Book The Cook was the best dish I have had on a plane). Comfortable spacious cabin plenty of overhead bin space addressed by name more movies than I could get through. Flights departed and arrived on time Changi a very easy airport to transit through. It was very clear why Singapore Airlines remains one of the very best airlines in the world.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,8,SQ469 Colombo to Singapore on Feb 10th. Back with them after almost 4 years I had again a positive experience despite the terrible schedule out of CMB (leaving at 1.30am): brand new A330-300 great and attentive crew and entertainment system displayed on a big PTV. During my previous experience with them I remember the seats were more comfortable and softer on their B777 but the legroom is still far above average for economy and service outstanding. Arrival to Changi on time and out of the terminal in less than half an hour really a fantastic airport in terms of facilities and organization.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Flew Singapore Airlines to Yangon Myanmar return. Excellent flights - all on time. Service and leg room very good. Prefer the aircraft with the 2 seat row on the side as you don't feel so packed in. Meals were good.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Recently I traveled on B777-200ER from Mumbai to Singapore. It was a very comfortable flight. The Economy Class seats are quite comfortable with good in-flight entertainment system but yes some improvements in the system are required. The lavatories of B777-200 are way too small. It feels claustrophobic sometimes and has no window. Crew were very helpful and responsive. Overall a good option to travel long haul.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Recently travelled from London Heathrow to Singapore then Singapore to Brisbane. Travelled alone first time. Staff were absolutely wonderful on board polite and attentive. Very comfortable and food very good. Check in outstanding no wait or delays at any point even collecting cases very quick. I would highly recommend these airlines to everyone travelling long haul.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,3,yes,7,SQ319 from LHR to SIN on the 777 300ER with new business class. Generally a good flight with excellent service good food and fantastic entertainment. The big downside is the new seat / bed. This has been ineptly designed and suffers from several really irritating issues that should have been resolved before it was rolled out. The seat is wide and has no side or lumbar support so whatever position you adopt it is not good for the back and not comfortable. The armrest to one side contains the table and a a small locker. Both are opened by pushing down. As these are exactly where your arm naturally rests they keep popping up which is annoying. When flipped over into bed mode the mattress is very hard. You have to lie at a diagonal angle due to restricted length and this is not comfortable. A further problem is that seat belt when in bed mode is an inertia reel seat belt - it is far too sensitive so if you turn onto your side or at least try too it locks and stops you turning and then you have to stop again very gently pull it out before completing the turn. It is nearly a great seat and bed but suffers from too many basic flaws which could and should have been spotted and resolved by the designer. Disappointing. Other than the poor bed / seat and lack of an amenity kit a good flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,3,no,6,Recently returned from Melbourne via Singapore. The seat on the trip from Singapore to Manchester was really uncomfortable as a result I have a bruised coccyx which is still painful. The stop in Munich is a complete pain and makes for a horrendous journey time about 16 hours. Would think twice before booking with Singapore again.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,HKG-SIN-KUL. Older plane a bit dirty. IFE on the blink. Need to get newer planes for these flight segments. Staff experience was great without complaints. Used FF but difficult to get seats and the airline surcharges were high paying like a coach seat. Had to use all FF as they were expiring and not renewable.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,MEL-SIN-MEL in January 2014 in Economy Class. Seats 39 (Aisle) on way up 34 (aisle) on return leg. 747-300 MEL- SIN the 380 on the SIN-MEL leg. Check in for this flight was very slow the flight was as a consequence 30 minutes late leaving with no apology for the delay. The plane on the way to Singapore (the refitted 747) was much more comfortable in my view than the A380. The refitted 747 is not as wide as the 380 the seats seemed to be more comfortable and certainly had better lumbar support. The service was faultless on the way up. The beverage service quite prompt and the inflight meal looked OK. A further snack was served about 1.5 hours prior to landing. The red-eye flight on the way back to Melbourne on the A380 was OK but not great. However the flight left on time the meals and beverage service was efficient and the meal was adequate if nothing special. The seat however was not comfortable - not enough lumbar support and I had back ache for some days afterwards. The blanket provided was of good quality and nice and warm. The crew were efficient as is usual for Singapore Airlines but not very friendly. One of the toilets in the economy cabin was made unavailable for passengers with no explanation as to why. Information given out by 2 crew members about the flight wasn't accurate - they said the arrival time would be 30 minutes earlier than the actual arrival time but in the end we landed on time. However we were kept waiting once we landed and had to stay on the plane at Melbourne airport. Very frustrating after a long flight. However overall having flown with a number of airlines Singapore Airlines is definitely probably one of the better ones. Both the ground staff and the cabin crew are relatively on the ball. There are loads of choices for in-flight entertainment although I wish they would make the headphones more user-friendly and comfortable to wear - after about a couple of hours they hurt my ears and I could not make them short enough to fit comfortably at all. The service is very efficient and the planes are pretty comfortable although I would not recommend the A380 for a long night flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,,,2,no,3,Just returned from trip to UK via Manchester (from Melbourne) had ordered (and phoned prior to trip) to order special meals as have a sugar allergy. Very disappointed as the meals were hopeless. Offered me fruit coleslaw sugar-free jelly (inedible) all unsuitable. Am so disappointed that in this day and age that either a nutritionist or dietician does not oversee these 'special meals'. The cabin crew were very kind and did their best but it was woefully inadequate and on this basis am unlikely to travel this airline again.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,I was a passenger on 4 flights between December and end of January 2014. Johannesburg to Singapore was good with excellent staff service and 5 star service for everything. Singapore to Adelaide the staff were less attentive. Adelaide to Singapore my return was again 5 star service. The cabin crew were visible the whole time. Singapore to Johannesburg was not a good flight. My screen did not work properly my headset was not working and as a diabetic traveller the lack of food service was panic stations for myself. As we left at 2.10 in the morning a filled bread roll for the entire flight back does not suffice. I explained to the staff that I needed to have something to eat and was afforded a small bread roll and an apple. Snacks were available but they do not take the place of a meal for passengers. Meals are necessary for diabetics and they cannot travel on snacks for 8 hours especially as the inbound flight would have also just served a snack prior to landing.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,MLE-SIN SIN-PER on A330-300. Flight was Male to Singapore was on a fairly dated aircraft. There were dirt and scuff marks across most of the surfaces which detracted from the feeling of luxury! Good service though and food and meals were of a high standard. Singapore to Perth flight was a much newer and cleaner aircraft with fantastic staff. This flight would be a 10/10 and by comparison the flight from Male was lacking in the service area. Seat was quite difficult to sleep on as angled seats are used.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Great flight all round! I flew SYD-SIN and really enjoyed my flight on Singapore's A380. The inflight entertainment was great with all the latest movies and TV shows. I was lucky enough to be sitting on the upper deck which offers more cabin space. The food was great and had a good variety of Western and Asian food. The seats were comfortable and had an ok recline. The cabin attendants were friendly and always had a smile!
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,Frankfurt to Singapore Singapore to Beijing. Semi-traditional Christmas Day dinner option decorations in cabin festive music and the best flight attendants. My airline of choice for long haul because nothing was a problem for them.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Excellent trip in Boeing 777-200. Flight delayed 45 Minutes. Request for certain seat was accommodated and the flight was only half full resulting in several empty seats given options for sleep. Service good and 2-3 hot meals were served (dinner hot snacks breakfast). Staff hard working and professional. A true 5 star airline with a genuine economy class product.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,yes,8,Flew Paris CDG-SIN-SYD. First leg was on the A380 and we were seated in exit row seats on the upper deck. Much quieter and nicer than downstairs. The attendants were great food pretty good and as it was a long flight there were trays of drinks and snacks available at the back - you could just help yourself. Flight left about 30 mins late but still arrived in SIN on time. Second leg from SIN-SYD was on an older 777. Seats nowhere near as comfortable very few movies on an old entertainment system. The attendants on this leg weren't as good either they just didn't seem interested in helping compared to the other leg. So the first flight was wonderful the second one not so much. Singapore Airlines is still very good and recommend it.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,Manchester-Singapore-Sydney return. Brilliant service good food for economy class. Flight attendants worked hard and were first class. On the outward journey suggested we might want to move to have more space sadly the plane was packed coming back. We will use them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,HND-SIN-JNB-SIN-NRT. Took off late from HND in an A330 due to aircraft arrival. Cabin crew did a good job. No amenity kits distributed. Seat had a lot of space and IFE was loaded with good selections. Had the Japanese style breakfast which was good. Later served refreshment (had a choice) which was nice. I had the Spaghetti and Eggplant really good. Cabin crew made continuous drink runs. A330 had dirty seats that needed cleaning or replacement but a good flight. Took off late from SIN in a revamped 777-200. Lots of space and legroom. Amenity kits distributed. Refreshment was a sandwich and I fell asleep after eating. Had the Omelette for Breakfast. Really good. IFE was not loaded up. Arrived early into JNB. Ground staff at JNB really nice and friendly for being 0605 in the morning. JNB-SIN took off on time. Full flight and again in a revamped 777-200. Amenity kits distributed. Served lunch after an hour. I had the braised pork which was really good. Fell asleep but was awakened by the constant snack runs of sandwiches which were small but very tasty. Constant wine refills were also done. Fruit cookies and chips were also distributed as snacks. For Breakfast asked for chicken but was served the Omelette with sausage. No complaints as it was perfect! Arrived into SIN early. SIN-NRT gate said closed but they were letting pax check in. Seemed like boarding took forever. Took off on time in A380. Seat was cramped and smaller than 777-200 and A330 seats. Served lunch I had the Japanese selection it was ok. Fell asleep and was occasionally awakened to cabin crew doing drink runs. Aircraft seemed to be really cold. Landed in NRT early. With all the late UA flights arriving Immigration was a nightmare! The last flight seemed to be a little low on standards but overall Singapore Airlines is still right up there next to ANA.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,London to Singapore Singapore to Sydney 5th January 2014. We had our dates mixed up and turned up to the airport for the wrong flight a day late. This was our fault and Singapore Airlines were very helpful and managed to put us on the next flight (the one we wrongly turned up for). We were not charged anything for this and the ground staff were very professional and helpful. The flight were good seats were as comfortable as economy gets and the entertainment was excellent. The cabin crew were polite and very professional. The food was really good. Because we were headed all the way to Sydney we had to try and get on another flight at Singapore. Once again the ground staff were helpful and professional and put us on the next flight to Sydney at no additional cost. The second flight was as good as the first with comfortable seating great entertainment and service and good food. All round very pleased with Singapore Airlines and grateful!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,2,no,5,Flew economy from LA to SIN in May 2013. The seat is spacious and provides enough legroom. However I was utterly disappointed with the service. I fell asleep when they were handing out the meals. I woke up when all the passengers were just about to dig in and I immediately asked for my meal. But I was told that they had run out of lunch and the rude air stewardess walked away without offering anything else. Aren't they supposed to have enough meals for everyone? Even though the air stewardess offered 2 small bags of chips later this still did not make up for it. Light snacks for main meal? I don't think so.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,CGK-SIN-DEL SQ 967 and SQ 406. Connection time more than sufficient. The seat was comfortable but not fully flat. The meal choices I had on the CGK-SIN Route were Rendang and Lasagne. I tried the Rendang and it was delicious soft tender and quite spicy. The TV was sufficient and I'm thankful they have charging port on the SQ 406. I slept for the rest of the flight and managed to do some last minute inflight shopping before landing.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Auckland to Singapore to Mumbai return. Excellent service by cabin crew B777-300ER from AKL to SIN. Seats were comfortable. Inflight entertainment was excellent. I had pre arranged a special meal that was delicious. At Singapore airport ground staff member was waiting to guide passengers to Mumbai as it was a fast connection. Singapore to Mumbai was B777-200 - another nice flight.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,SGN-SIN-SYD on 9th January 2014. First leg on B770-200. Excellent and proactive ambitious and diligent staff whether old or young. Seats not lie flat but no need for a two hours ride. Lounge access food and drinks very good. 3-4 options for hot food given! The Bollinger champagne is now replaced. No cheese table could be offered. No wifi available. SIN-SYD on A380-800. The cabins provide some privacy. Beds are flat but not fully horizontal a small angle of 3-4% remains disturb sleeping and annoys. The TV screens are heavily light reflecting and are more mirrors than TVs – what a disaster as compared to the investment. The tray tables are in a funny skew position forcing the gourmand to lean sideways while eating. Disappointed by this seat furthermore its hard to operate. Food is excellent and options are plenty. No cheese table offered. No wifi available. FAs were kind caring and attentive. SQ is the only airline serving stout beer - quite charming. Wines are good and food is good as well.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Dec 26 Shangahi Pudong-Singapore-Auckland with brand new B777-300ER very efficient check-in and pleasant transit experience comfortable seat with spacious legroom large AVOD screen with plenty of movies/tv shows/music channels. Cabin crew very friendly and polite lots food and very tasty beverages/snacks/fruit served frequently during the mid-might flight of Singapore-Auckland. Return flight Christchurch-Singapore-Shanghai Pudong with old and dated B777-200 can't believe SG still use this type of aircraft for 10hrs flight mini VOD screen is like a joke again outstanding cabin crew and food service.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew economy from Frankfurt to Singapore. Food was decent leg space sufficient. A very smooth flight with good customer service. Our flight out of Frankfurt was delayed due to bad weather in New York missed our connecting flight from Singapore to Perth as a result. We were very impressed with their service in this situation. They organised a room and paid a return taxi fare to the very nice Hotel Village Changi. We spent most of our 10 hour wait there eating the free buffet meals and resting in the comfortable room. Although we were frustrated that we were so severely delayed having a hotel room and meals provided made the situation less stressful.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,no,5,MEL-SIN Business in December. I was surprisingly disappointed on this trip aboard their 777-300ER aircraft. Granted the newer Business class was not yet installed but overall I wasn't all that impressed with the quality of the seat which looked rather tired. The lounge in Melbourne is barely comparable to a domestic Virgin Australia lounge since they have split it into Business/First and had a very poor food and beverage offering. Despite requesting not to be woken for breakfast service during the flight to maximise sleep I was. Not a picky traveler and not a regular Business traveler either but found myself a little disappointed at the offering considering the hype.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,Flying Dubai to Penang via Singapore. Excellent service excellent food not too much expensive great flight entertainment selection. Flight from Singapore to Penang was operated by Silkair with an excellent service. Great airline overall. Definitely using this again.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,1,SQ 345 ZRH to SIN 9 Dec 2013. The A380 was late due to non communicated reasons - no Economy Class in Upper Deck were available thus our long lasting reservations were cancelled and we got rather poor seats in the aft of the airplane. The meal was 'overcooked' thus not edible service was non-existent we had to get our drinks ourselves in the galley.¨It was the lousiest flight to Asia we have experienced.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,4,no,6,"Flew from Singapore to Dubai in Economy class and I hate the seat configuration. Its 3-4-3 which doesn't give you any privacy if you're travelling with a partner. There are few ""couple seats"" but unfortunately all were booked a month before departure. The seats were quite cramped. No power outlet to charge you mobile phones. The food that was served was the worst airline meal ever had. Totally bland and overcooked chicken. Cheap ice creams. Crew were monotonous and especially one of them who went around asking ""would you like to have a coffee or tea"" non-stop. it took forever for the crew to finish their meal service which resulted in longer time to serve coffee and tray collections. Never flying on a SIA flight again."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,3,yes,8,23 Dec 2013 SQ638 seated row 73. Singapore to Tokyo - red eye flight was bumpy and hard to sleep. At row 73 we could hear the noise of toilet flushing which made it harder to sleep. Cabin service included snack and drink after take off and breakfast 2 hrs before landing were excellent. 31 Dec 2013 SQ 637 seated row 79. Tokyo to Singapore - Full flight food delicious and service even other airlines talked about. Cabin crew smiled all the time.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,2,18th December from Brisbane to Singapore. I have been taking varied airlines such as Qantas Emirates for this same route over the years. I have to say that I am quite disappointed with the service and that there has indeed been a decline in SIA's standards in this area. I ordered a special vegetarian oriental meal whilst checking in online. As it was served first our drink orders were not taken. My vegetarian meal came with only a piece of bread and the main meal. It was extremely oily and I had no salad or fruit to go with it. I was also refused a dessert as I was told special meals had their own desserts. I never received anything. I was also never served a drink until I asked the stewardess clearing the trays if I could get one. Even then she said she would get back to me and never did. I also tried to do some inflight shopping but the airline had extremely limited stock of the products in the catalogue. Most of the products were not in stock at all. I think compared to the competitors for this same leg SIA is definitely below average. I would think twice before paying this much when I can get a cheaper flight with better service.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,SQ976 to Bangkok from Singapore: okay service on 20 December. SQ981 came back to Singapore from Bangkok: much better service. They left the light on for my father who was reading staff were much friendlier and were happy to serve. Both flights on A330 in-flight entertainment had lots of selection.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,SIN-HK-SIN on A380. SQ866 and 865 Singapore to Hong Kong departed on time and FA were friendly and attentive to our needs and always smiled. Kris-world was excellent with a wide range of movies including recently release new movies for our entertainment. It's only a 4 hrs flight but to have an IFE onboard made it such a wonderful experience to enjoy your 4hrs. Meals were good and ice cream was given for the first leg return leg had a new selection of movies which I always enjoyed having. And the best thing was they had a Christmas menu and it was excellent with turkey and log cakes. Delayed arrival entering Singapore due to heavy traffic and captain informed us of the delay. Overall a wonderful experience and SQ has kept its high standards in service and quality once again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I travelled from Singapore to Kolkata and back during the month of December and I have to say that the service is far better than any other carrier. During the night flight back to Singapore passengers were given Givenchy amenity kits. The food was also very nice and tasty and we were given a menu card before departure which I felt was a nice touch. The last thing I wish to highlight is that the inflight entertainment Krisworld was excellent and all the latest blockbusters were available onboard. I was totally spoilt for choice during the short 3 hour 50 minutes flight. Strongly recommended to everyone.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,3,yes,7,SIN-FCO-SIN on SQ366/365. The crews on both flights were outstanding and accommodating to our requests. Nonetheless there was a handful of crew members who whilst polite were rather cold and didn't appear to be interested in going the extra mile. I've noticed this lately on SIA but this was made up by the exceptional service rendered by the rest of the crew. We ordered special meals. Food on the outbound was excellent though our vegetarian meal on the inbound was very bland and not fulfilling at all. IFE selection was mediocre at best. Movie and TV selection was limited and disappointing. This tends to be the case on SIA it's a bit of a hit and miss. Emirates has its act together much better in this area. We got a refurbished 772 which was nice. Legroom was great. However the hard seat cushions made sitting down a bit uncomfortable after a while and ill-placed IFE remotes which were on the armrests. Your legs would keep knocking against the controls. Overall it was an above average flight and I would use SQ again. Though I wouldn't be adamant. It wasn't spectacular and I'm sure they're competitors can offer equally good flights.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,LHR to SIN 10th Dec. Business class flight on the A380. After use of lounge boarded plane easily and was directed to my seat by FA. Offered drinks went for Champagne and also asked about post take off drinks. Offered papers and magazines for the journey. Seat very comfy and although a night flight did not have put into bed mode I found more than enough adjustment with recline and I am 5 ft 11. All meals were very good with plenty of choice and all presented very well. Drinks service very good with friendly crew in galley whenever I wanted something. Arrival in Singapore very good flight crew said goodbye and all seem to have been pleased to see us. Although this was the a380 I think the renewed 777 offering is better.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,9,We arrived in Paris today flying SYD-SIN-CDG both legs on the A380. We were seated in upper deck economy which is much better than the lower deck (quieter less people smaller seat configuration). The staff service on both legs was excellent - lots of drink runs and when I discovered one of the earphones on my headset wasn't working I was promptly given a new one. Staff always had a smile and were polite. Seats comfortable food not too bad for economy. Only drawback was the entertainment system could have had more movies.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,,,1,no,1,Perth to Houston TX on SQ 062 my wife and I. Flight to Moscow aborted at last minute routed to Warsaw where Singapore Airlines had no affiliation. Sat on plane for 2 hours after landing in Warsaw then escorted to airport. Once in the lounge and able to check flights we saw we had been booked on a flight to Paris and to Houston the next morning. Went to gate and told we had no ticket for this flight went back to where we originally left and there was a SA rep. After some time told we could not take this flight. Told to gather luggage and go to a hotel. Told we were being put on a plane to Copenhagen then to Chicago and then to Houston arriving 36 hours after planned arrival. Inquired why we could not take flight to Paris as previously scheduled connection time now too close and airline would not book. In summary I have been flying internationally my entire oil field career over 30 years I have experienced delays cancellations re-routes etc. I have never seen such a poor handling of a situation as this. I have always chosen Singapore when possible but will think twice in the future.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,We flew BOM-SIN-BOM earlier this year for a 10 day holiday in Singapore. The flights were great both ways and we were extremely happy with the choice of food. For BOM-SIN me and my son tried the Lamb dish - but did not like it. The crew promptly replaced this with the available veg choice. The return sector actually had a better choice of Indian food. Beverages choice was also great - and of course they had Tiger beer! Good and no nonsense comfortable flight.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,LHR-SIN-SYD both legs on A380. I couldn't recommend this airline any more. Great legroom for economy and seat pitch hot towels before take off some of the best food I have had in the sky regular drinks service great entertainment system with Krisworld clean cabin (they even had some Xmas decorations up). FA'S were very helpful and the girls were dressed impeccably in their Singapore girl outfits and always smiling and willing to help. The added plus of Changi airport being SQ's hub made transit a very pleasant experience. If you're flying the A380 v1 seating plan - I recommend booking an upper deck economy ticket a small dedicated cabin at the back of the upper deck provides a smaller quieter experience. This is a 5 star airline and blows my home airline BA out of the water. You will not be disappointed! They made over 10000 miles in the air somewhat enjoyable!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,SQ2 from SIN to HKG on Dec 9th was delayed 5 hours due to faulty parts they had to change aircraft to fly us all home. Despite that there were enough staff to attend to us we were kept informed of the situation very clearly Free drinks and snack boxes provided. Then a dinner up to SGD 15 was provided for us. Staffs were visible ally he time to answer question and calm our fears. When finally boarding we were given a small token as an apology. Arrived in HK at past 2 am we were given free coaches as well as taxi fares to go home depending on our destination. I could not complain but praise this airlines for treating their customers right. Truly deserving its 5 star status all the way! On board the 777-300ER seat was comfortable good AVOD crew were hard working frequent drink top ups and good quality late dinner served. Overall I am impress and will not hesitate to fly with them again and again.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,3,On 23 November I got SQ 068 to Sao Paulo and I was really surprised to see the cleanliness of the aircraft. Unfortunately due to connecting flight problems I lost my flight back to Barcelona and I could not compare - and perhaps change my mind - the poor state of maintenance of aircraft's. I don't think I will be flying again with Singapore but it is also however the best option to fly from Barcelona to Montevideo.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,no,6,I've recently flown on SQ 423 BOM-SIN connecting SQ217 SIN-MEL in J Class. Can I say at the outset the crew on SQ and their service to the business class passenger is wonderful. I used points to upgrade and it was a rare experience for me to enjoy J class so was really keen to sample SQ business class. Great sized LCD TV screen brand new cabin on SQ423 wide seats and such a massive sense of space! Amazingly for a post-midnight departure ex Mumbai we were served a full 3 course meal which was lovely but it's almost impossible to sleep on a full stomach. Much more logical to serve a light snack on departure and full breakfast before Singapore surely? The menu didn't indicate this was an option to be requested so I assume no breakfast service was available. The seat in recline position was great and quite comfortable but it was after putting the bed down to try and sleep the discomfort began. A very hard lumpy bed from the various joins and cushions. And the massive belt that pins you to the bed is totally uncomfortable. I felt like I was tied to the bed couldn't turn over couldn't breathe and ended up having to sit back up again. Equals no sleep! So so disappointing. I'm happy to drape a seat belt over me while sleeping I'm not prepared to be tied down! SQ 217 on the SIN-MEL leg was an old version of the 1-2-1 config. Dirty walls worn leather seats small TV drinks placed on the shelf at the front so it was a case of having to undo the seat belt and stretch out to take it. Beautiful food excellent service lovely lovely crew. But again the hard uncomfortable bed. A less than enjoyable experience I won't be travelling SQ business again.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,2,no,2,On 15/11/13 flight from Brisbane to Singapore leaving at 23.45 was the worst flight with this airline. Old plane no leg room poor service I was flabbergasted as I have been flying with them for years. Coming home the plane was up to their usual standard but I will be very wary of flying or recommending them in the future.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,8,Flew from LAX to SIN with a stop over at Narita then SIN to MNL. First time on an A380. Boarding took a while since it was a full flight and there are lot of pax once on board things were very good. FA's were polite and very helpful and are always present whenever you need anything. Food was definitely some of the best airline food I have had with plenty of drink runs dessert and what not. Choice between Japanese and Western. Flight was on time though had a very hard landing in Narita. Was probably the longest flight I have had but it was very enjoyable. SIN-MNL they used an older B777 with IFE not AVOD though unlike the A380 but other than that it was fantastic. Transit at Changi was great had a 12 hour lay over.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,8,Singapore - Zurich and return. On the A380 with all business class seating on the upper deck. Overall a very good trip. Departure from SIN is scheduled very late (01.30) so I had no problem getting off to several hours sleep at that time of the morning. Coming back is a daytime flight which I personally find more tiring. Anyway the product remains a solid one. The service was very good. Food and drinks all fine. Still think the IFE system is showing its age compared to say Emirates but quite OK and had no problem finding a few movies to watch on the daytime return flight. My complaints remain the same as ever. The business class seat is plain weird and for taller types like me the diagonal sleeping position is only just long enough. In addition SQ start to look expensive compared to the Gulf carriers for the route I was travelling (SIN-ZRH-NCE) by a couple of thousand S$ which is substantial.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,Flight SQ317 (LHR-SIN) on 30th November 2013 seat 27K on upper deck. Check-in was fast although I understand that one of the check-in assistants was rude to my colleague by suggesting it was obvious he'd not flown business class before but hey we were in England and you can't complain about poor service here. The flight itself was fine. I had used BTC for the food. The only let down was the breakfast which was bizarre. I had pre-ordered multigrain toast after a few mis-understandings on what it came with I decided to stay with this choice however I wish I had not. It consisted of 2 pieces of what was more like chipboard than toast accompanied by grilled asparagus carrots aubergine and courgettes and on the same place was a sweet pastry. Not sure who makes up the dishes but this certain was not complimentary to each other. All the veg were dry and chewy. Having usually flown Virgin business class in the past I was used to having my bed made for me but this does not happen in SIA flights also the bed even though lay flat was designed in a way that for me at 6ft2 was very uncomfortable. Overall not a bad experience just some oddities.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,LHR-SIN-PER return. First leg fantastic upstairs economy on the A380 flight half full with plenty of room stretch out flight attendants friendly attentive very enjoyable. Both legs to and from Perth comfortable enough but nothing to rave about. Return from Singapore was terrible. Boarding call for flight was a late and all classes families with children etc. we're called within in minutes apart total chaos ensued. First class business and economy all cramming in a rush to get on felt like budget airline experience. Flight was full with no room to move attendants stretched to handle the demands of anxious late night passengers lots of small children it's a thin line between a good and a bad flight in economy when full. Still the better economy airline for long haul.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,Flight SQ318 (SIN-LHR) Suite 3A. I had the fortune to fly in one of the suites on my return trip. The service in this class is what you would expect private entrance at the airport with the added bonus of a separate security channel. I was taken to the SilverKris lounge and upgraded from the 1st class lounge to the private room. This was a great experience especially having a cook to order breakfast service and a nice sized dinning room. The boarding service itself with a private walkway to the suites was very speedy and as soon as I arrived at the plane door you are taken to your suite by a steward. Seated and then given a guided tour of all the facilities and features. The service itself was amazing if not a little over attentive but being served my the most senior stewards you would expect this. The food was good although some items were a little overcooked. I would recommend this but only if you have about 10k to spend without missing it. The suite itself it very comfortable and when the bed is made it was large enough for me to lay out fully even being 6ft2.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,1,no,2,"I have flown SQ for a long time but in the past couple of years I was disappointed to notice the decline in service. I fly between JFK and Singapore a lot and they have not changed the menu on the route in a while. The seats were also cramped and the legroom was awful. I'm 6 feet and my legs were pressed against the seat in from of me. The foot rest doesn't help at all if you are above 5'8"". Boarding is usually pushed back to about 10 minutes before the scheduled departure and the boarding staff in SIN didn't seem to care much. overall the service is now a far cry from what it used to be and I now refuse to fly with them."
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LHR-Singapore-Sydney/Melbourne-Singapore-LHR. Check in staff polite and efficient cabin crew attentive but not over bearing food as good as you can get when flying drinks readily available and plentiful and seat that comfortable I slept the majority of each flight. All in all a very pleasant experience I always fly Singapore Airlines when flying to Australia.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,3,yes,8,SIN-HND the end of November with Boeing 777-300 (non-ER). The plane is amongst Singapore Airlines' oldest fleets but everything was just comfortable as aircraft's are clean cabin attendants are helpful polite overall service was great. Two thumbs up for SQ as always.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Perfect airline to me! Every time I had to fly in a long-haul flight I chose SQ because of its high quality service. It never let me down. The flight from Auckland to Changi SIN was as excellent as usual. Food was great and plenty. The staffs also recommended me to try Singapore Sling and it was great. Whenever I woke up during the night I always saw the crew's smiles. The transfer at Changi Airport was very good too!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,no,6,I flew PER-SIN on a 777 and SIN-SUB on A330 last month. Good points: punctual comfortable seats great food great IFE (when you get the chance to use it). Bad points: On these aircraft types at least Singapore Airlines aircraft don't have individual air vents and it can become incredibly stuffy especially on the 777 where the cabin temperature was too hot - not the first time I have had this problem. Also the Surabaya flight was about 2hrs 15min which should have been enough to take in a 90 minute movie; but they didn't turn on Krisworld until about 30 minutes after pushback then 70 min later they collected the headsets and said they would be turning it off. In fact Krisworld kept running for another 30 minutes and was only turned off 15 minutes before landing. Had I known this I could have continued to watch the movie with subtitles - I think this was very poorly managed. Why can't they have IFE throughout the flight? - Qantas manages it.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew from Singapore to Osaka and back in November 2013. Must say that this has to be the best flight I have taken from boarding to the service and the meal as well as the inflight entertainment. It was an experience that is worth the premium.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Heathrow - Singapore - Perth 31/10/13. Perth - Singapore - Heathrow 18/11/13. The cabin crew made a long flight a pleasure they couldn't do enough - always smiling nothing was too much trouble. I will recommend and certainly fly with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,SIN-HKG-SIN. Check in at both airports were fast and efficient. The planes on both legs were the Boeing 777-200. The IFE on the plane is in serious need of upgrading. Watching movie was a struggle as the screen resolution is very low. Furthermore it can only be used after the plane took off and before it landed. This is in contrast to some Middle Eastern airlines where the IFE can be used right after stepping in to and before getting off the plane. The cabin crews were polite especially the one on the return leg. She was very helpful and full of smile. The special foods that I requested were available on both leg and tasted ok.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew out of Heathrow on 20th November flight 317 to Australia (via Singapore) the onward flight departed Singapore on 21st November flight number 217 to Melbourne. Quite simply the best airline we've flown with. All staff immaculately dressed and turned out. Customer service was second to none. All other airlines should aspire to be like this. British Airways take note you need to up your game.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flight from CPH-SIN-AKL on 777-200 and return AKL-SIN-LHR on 777-200/777-300. Perfect service. Amazing staff on board. Great quality of food. A lot of space in Business Class. Comfortable seats especially on new Business Class on 777-200ER and 777-300ER.
,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew from Singapore to Los Angeles (SQ11/SQ12). Being a krisflyer member I never regret taking a Singapore Airlines flight. It has truly made my flight comfortable. Food was excellent customer service was good and so were the seats.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,I've been flying SQ now for more than 30 years (Business and Y-Cl/Longhaul and shorthaul) and have never experienced any problems with this airline: Last Flight: MUC-MAN return: at both airports no queues at check-in organised boarding friendly and helpful crews even on this short route choice of different snacks and additional drink rounds and full IFE. Prices below Easyjet fares on this route! Flights on time or ahead of schedule! There are only 2 small negative points for this route: quite early departure from MUC (06.10 am) and since some time you are not any more allowed to earn LH Miles on this route despite SQ is a STAR Alliance member.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,What a refreshing experience. We travelled to Singapore less expensive than alternatives and better value for money. Our flight was on time the plane clean modern and well presented. The staff delightful on both outbound and Inbound journeys impeccably presented and with a welcoming smile. They were attentive and went about the cabin helping passengers with a smile and minimum fuss. Unlike other airlines we had a printed menu the food was excellent served very nicely proper cutlery too. Ample choice of entertainment if you can't make a choice from all offered you're not trying. Very nice 'wake up' gradual using staged lighting relaxing music playing for landing. Could not fault this airline will be looking to book with Singapore Airlines again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,SIN-SYD. Flight not full so plenty of room on board. Refurbished 777 was comfortable and in-flight entertainment good without being spectacular. As usual service was excellent - cheerful attentive polite - everything you come to expect from SQ! Very satisfied and will continue to use this airline.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,We flew SYD-SIN on 30 Sept 13 and had a wonderful flight. The staff were great and the food and wine very good. I would like to commend the purser for his kindness and help on this flight. The return flight on 10 Nov 13 was almost the opposite to the last flight. The food was not so good and overcooked. I regret my harsh comments to a staff member on the matter. I would still fly with Singapore in the future.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,KUL-SIN-BCN and return. Both on B777-300ER economy class. The aircraft seating was comfortable with good selection of inflight entertainment. Service is as usual impeccable and faultless. The cabin crew were very helpful attentive and generous with drinks and snacks in between flight. Just encountered some delay on return leg resulting in missed connection. Otherwise truly value for money.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,SYD-SIN on 10 Nov 2013. Excellent service as usual fantastically attentive and friendly staff - moved me to a bulkhead seat to give me extra legroom. Food great drinks always available lots of water provided. Aircraft entertainment more than adequate. Normal high standard.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,SIN-HKG return on A380s. I was lucky enough to be seated on the upper deck seats 74A and 76K. There was a side storage compartment beside the window seats. Upper deck economy cabin is a small cabin which contains around 80 seats. SIN-HKG I was greeted by the FA's with smiles food was very good. HKG-SIN flight an unusual announcement made by the captain about strong winds on the end of the airfield . Upon reaching 1500ft when engine power was reduced the plane felt a sudden drop in altitude causing most of the passengers including me to shout. Babies on board this route was also crying. When seatbelt signs were switched off staff were trying to keep the baby calm. I would recommend on the A380 to take seats on the upper deck as it is quieter and more attention from FA's.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,Brisbane-Singapore-Shanghai. Crew friendly and helpful. A330-300 Brisbane to Singapore and Boeing 777 Singapore to Shanghai travelling in a group if 45 people. Return Beijing-Singapore-Brisbane with friendly crew members. Very good food on all flights and a wide range I movies on in-flight entertainment. Seats were very comfortable. Got a window seat nearly every time.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,Flew CGK-SIN-FRA-JFK and LAX-NRT-SIN-CGK. SIN-FRA-JFK and LAX-NRT-SIN were on the Airbus A380 and Boeing 777-200 for both CGK-SIN and SIN-CGK. Flight was fine choices of food were great the inflight entertainment system was one of the best that i had ever used. Couldn't sleep on flight to JFK because the cabin was too noisy. But thank goodness that I could sleep peacefully on my way back from LAX to SIN. In terms of seating the seat was comfortable though there's still room for improvement maybe additional inches to the seat pitch would help. In the end I would definitely fly on Singapore Airlines again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,SQ327 MAN-SIN via MUN. My first flight ever with Singapore Airlines and I was very impressed. On an Economy ticket the meal choices were amazing and I even had the chance to order snacks and sandwiches at any point in between meal service. The FT's were helpful and courteous no matter what the problem or request was. There were 2 downsides only. 1) Having to fly via Munich disembark and sit in the airport for 1.5hrs. 2) The individual screens had the movies on a rolling system so you had to wait until its run was over to start watching the film you wanted from the beginning. With all the films at different lengths this meant a lot of planning to get your timings right throughout the 16hr flight. Of course I wanted to sleep as well and due to the chairs being comfortable and the added help of a window seat I was able to get a few hrs. We arrived 45mins early so I was able to get my connecting flight to HKG with ease. Overall a very good quality flight and I would not hesitate to fly Singapore Airlines again.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,My first SQ experience in 35+ years travelling was a mixed bag in regional A330 Business class to/from SIN connecting with (other carrier) European flights. Service on outward SQ236 BNE-SIN sector reflected many online reviews I had read: zealously attentive but semi-robotic and impersonal. My change of seat at check-in from 14A to 14K obviously threw the pre-flight cabin briefing off its tracks it was not until the third F/A interaction after the seatbelt signs had been turned off in the climb to cruise that the penny dropped that neither my surname nor my gender matched those the crew were using in dealing with me. At times I felt like a participant in a training video or that the crew couldn't wait to get home. That said the inwards SQ235 SIN-BNE return and final sector of a long trip two weeks later was an outstanding contrast with the archetypal Singapore Girl service striking exactly the right note: attentive without being intrusive modulated and moderated without being mechanical and generally more relaxed comfortable and charming. An invitation to be briefed on the seat controls would have been nice – the SQ regional J-boxes being rather unique – but the food drink and Kris-World IFE could not be faulted. My first time changing terminals at SIN too was a pleasantly seamless experience the Silver Kris lounge and its staff set an example to the industry world-wide.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,SQ860 SIN-HKG. 777-200ER. After flying MAN-SIN via MUN this flight was my final leg. I was greeted by FT who when looking at my boarding pass knew straight away that I had a special dietary requirement. Throughout the flight this FT seemed to have remembered a certain number of people's names in our cabin and spoke to us only by using Mr or Mrs as a prefix to our personal names. I was overly impressed as this is something you just don't expect in Economy Class. The service was excellent with refreshments throughout the flight. FT's were friendly and didn't disturb you if you wanted to sleep. A very comfortable trip with personal entertainment lots of leg room and a very high standard of service. What more could you want?
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew Sydney-London return all legs on the A380. The pitch was modest but it was still fine for me. Seat was a little hard but I still managed to catch some sleep on all 4 legs. Food was fabulous except on the Singapore- London leg the pasta was dry and hard. IFE was excellent with a wide array of choices and the staff service was unmatched even in economy class. The Singapore girls were all very attentive yet friendly attending to our needs efficiently. First time on this airline and definitely not the last for me.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,I had a flight from KUL-SIN-SYD with the A330 and A380. The flight was very successful great with good aircrew service and more than I expected. The food was like normal.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,SIN-BKK-SIN. Flew this leg on the 772 aircraft's which are one of the oldest in SIA's fleet. What was disappointing was the poor KrisWorld in-flight entertainment system. It was really old. The display on the screens were barely visible and that the buttons on the controls were hard to press. The seats was a bit cramped on the older planes. On food SIA met its expectations. I chose a seafood meal on the return trip and it was certainly appetizing.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,SIN-FRA on A380 upper deck emergency exit seats 71 H&K. Note these seats have no overhead storage as they are full of first aid equipment so try to get on early as you will struggle to find space. Initial start to flight was not good with a 1 hour delay and later finding out that the TV screen did not lock into place. What happened next was nothing short of amazing and should be a lesson in customer service (Emirates I hope you read this as SIA economy is better than your Business Class). Leading stewardess managed to tape the screen in place and I was able to use for the rest of the flight with juts a minor inconvenience. I was offered the chance to move but declined as my wife and I wanted the extra leg room. Service was fantastic thought out the flight which staff coming around with drinks and snacks often (we were not singled out) We were given a voucher to use on duty free which we used straight away to buy a honeymoon present. On hearing this the leading FA said she had a surprise for us and later came back with a congratulatory gift of a slice of cake and 2 glasses of Dom Perignon from First Class. This was the best experience I had on a flight regardless of class. The last four flights on SIA have been very good and consistent it is also nice to see that the staff are allowed to let their personality shine through.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,PER-SIN on B772 older aircraft with reduced entertainment selection. Seats were hard and in need of re-padding. Staff were friendly and genuine with a sense of humor. Also nice to see that they don't tell you every time that there is turbulence to sit down fasten seat belts etc once when it occurred was fine the rest of the time they assumed we listened. The last time I flew this leg the announcement was made 20 times. Good flight departed 15 min late arrived 15 min early.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,FRA-SIN-PER. First leg on A380 upper deck window seat. Seat was ok for a 12 hour flight storage bin between seat and window was really handy. Service very good with FA friendly and come around often which drinks and snacks. Meals offered on both legs were much better than anything I have eaten on economy in a very long time. Entertainment system worked fine with enough movies to keep you entertained for 3 days non stop. B772 on second leg was an older plane but still clean seats offered a bit more leg room but were hard as padding seemed warn out. Standard of service was again excellent. Both flights delayed FRA was by 45min due to tower and SIN by 1.5 hours due to a connecting flight being late. Latter part annoying as it got me into Perth airport when 4 planes had landed around the same time. The airport cannot cope and took me 1.5 hours to get out. (not the airlines fault).
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew LHR-SIN and return. The flight into Singapore was on the new B77W that was really state of the art. The seats were indeed more spacious as advertised. The IFE was totally top-notch with the huge screen and countless entertainment options. Food was terrific on both flights. Back to London on the A380 with the older (although still quite new) product. I sat in the small cabin at the upper deck which is really a big plus since it was way more cosy. Staff on both flights were very friendly and welcoming as always. SIA is still my airline of choice while travelling to Asia or Australia.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,MEL-SIN-KIX and FUK-SIN-MEL in Economy with MEL-SIN on A380 and all others on A330. Enjoyable flights in terms of comfort food and entertainment although the seats on the SIN-KIX leg was definitely a bit firmer than expected. Excellent service from cabin & ground service on all flights with the latter especially friendly & efficient at FUK. Probably the most consistently enjoyable food my wife and I have had on SIA or on any other carrier in Economy over the past 5 years or so. The entertainment system is extensive with more than enough choice for us although the advertising can be annoying after a while. A problem I experienced with the unit on the SIN-MEL flight was overcome when a particularly helpful cabin staff member re-started my system several times and then checked with me 2 or 3 times after that to ensure there had not been any further issues. SIA continues to be our airline of choice between MEL and Asia.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,,2,yes,5,SQ 978 Biz on Airbus 330. This is a short-haul flight from SIN-BKK. Comfortable seat that lay fully flat. I had a meal of chewy roasted pork. Service from FAs were nice.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,2,yes,2,BKK-SIN Old 777-300 Biz with no private TV screen and no inflight entertainment at all. Food was OK. Service OK. Seat reclined but not flat.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,CGK-SIN-CGK on the new A330. Utilized the web check-in and the process was fast when collecting boarding pass at the counter. Flight was only half full for the outbound flight. Cabin crews were going extra mile to serve the passengers - continuously offering drinks after meal. The inbound flight was also pleasant with the same high quality standard in terms of services. Very pleasant flight.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,2,yes,5,SQ 298 CHC-SIN Biz with no amenity bag. Boeing 777-300 with reclined seat that did not lay flat. Braised duck meal was so tough and not really edible. Had to ask for a roast beef sandwich instead. Older FAs were very nice and gave good service.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,yes,4,SQ 297 from SIN-CHC. This is a long haul overnight flight on a Boeing 777-300 Biz  seat reclined not fully flat. No amenity bag provided only the useless slippers and blind shade in Biz class. Food was OK. FAs were attentive.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,"Flew SQ22 from SIN-EWR (the world's longest flight) on 26th September on board a A340-500 approx. 18-20 hour flight (depending on winds). Unfortunately this route is disappearing very soon and I will miss the specially design all-business class airplane a lot. This day the service was spot-on the airplane/seat/configuration (1-2-1) food drinks - everything was exemplified ""best practice"". It was surely a memorable flight and yes I was the last to get off the plane."
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,A380 LHR-SIN Return sector of round-trip on 14/10/13. A faultless flight experience on the all-Business Class upper deck thanks to the swift check-in and boarding impeccable seat and cabin an exemplary cabin crew delicious meals and impressive IFE. No other airline offers such a calming inflight Business Class environment. I always arrive rested and refreshed after a long-haul flight with SIA and look forward to the next. It never fails to impress me how well-groomed the crew are (an important detail many passengers fail to notice such as the ambient music played at the right volume after landing) and how promptly attentive they are to passenger's needs. SIA remains polished peerless and focused on their product and services for the FIT. This flight demonstrated all SIA's qualities perfectly.
,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,no,5,MEL-SIN-MAA-SIN-MEL. MEL to SIN on 777-300. SIN-MAA-SIN on A330-300. Home trip SIN to MEL on A380. Staff excellent. Food very good (book the cook). No amenity kit. Lounge food was OK but not great. Breakfast at MEL lounge was terrible I left and went to ANZ lounge. Lounge at MAA is not worth commenting (not great at all). The MAA to SIN flight is tough as it departs close to midnight and arrives in Singapore less than 4 hours later so not much time for decent sleep. But overall I was rather comfortable on the 777 and A330 angle seats. But the A380 lie flat bed is not long enough (am 6ft 1). Terrible night's sleep I couldn't fly Singapore again until they have a bed that caters for near average height people. Expected more from a reputable airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,"I have recently returned from a trip to Bali with Singapore Airlines. Overall the journey was ok. Outbound we were in economy cabin on the upper deck of the A380 and we were lucky enough to get seated in the rows of two seats which were comfortable enough. I'm 6.1"" and my travel companion is 6.3"" and in terms of leg room for us there was not a lot. There is also a foot rest fitted to the back of the seat in front which when raised digs in to your shins. When it's lowered you can stretch your legs out over it but it then digs in to your calf muscles. It's poor design and it does affect comfort somewhat but not to the point of distraction. There were plenty of entertainment options available. Both my partner and I had issues with the IFE on the outbound leg which lasted about 30 minutes but the steward was able to re-boot the system for us eventually. The food was good and plentiful and the service was also excellent. The crew were constantly passing through the cabin handing out water and juice and other drinks were available during the flight from the back of the plane. The flights to and from Bali were on a 777-200 and both were fine. One thing to note we were served curry on the flight to DPS and it was hot. Sinagpore may need to tone down the chilli a little. Return leg from SIN-LHR was on 777-300 and at boarding it didn't look like it would be a full flight. We were in the forward economy cabin and this filled up and most seats were taken. However the rear cabin was virtually empty and people here were quick to take up whole rows to themselves. There could have been a better distribution of passengers to allow everyone to have a bit more room. Overall a great airline which with a few tweaks could be fantastic. I certainly felt that with other airlines flying long haul I've had more room."
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,SYD - SIN - LHR - SIN - SYD. Flight attendants did their utmost to be polite and offer individual service which was very impressive. Loved the added extras. The movies were good and there was sufficient variety. I had special meals and they were plentiful and tasty. Lots of drinks offered. Seats were just OK - the area behind the passenger's head is not positioned well and is therefore uncomfortable but otherwise the seat is OK and there was just enough leg room. Most flights were in ageing planes but the personalised service made up for it. I found the attendants to be the real strength of this airline. I would definitely fly them again.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flight SQ319 London to Singapore on 14/10/2013. Cabin crew were the nicest and most helpful crew we have come across in our travels. Would definitely recommend. We travel business class - well worth the money. Ground staff in Heathrow - taking our luggage 10 hours pre-flight was excellent we were so grateful. Will definitely travel with them again.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,,,2,no,4,NRT-LAX A380 upon boarding cabin crew guided me to the wrong side of cabin and wrong seat. No menu was provided for the entire flight and I did not know which champagne or wine I was drinking nor did I know what to expect for dinner or breakfast. Only for the main course (entree) did the cabin crew provide a quick booklet which after choosing was quickly taken away again. After asking cabin crew for a little help to figure out how to convert my seat into bed I was asked if it was my first time with Singapore Airlines (I am Krisflyer Gold). Cabin crew never asked if I wanted to be awaken for breakfast (which I did not). After waking me up and providing me with a cup of coffee I waited 50 minutes for breakfast to be served. Again no menu. A rather disappointing service.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,"Flew LHR-SIN-SYD. LHR-SIN on A380 all business upper deck. Seats A B & C row 61 main deck. Good leg room (I'm 5' 10"" 16 stone heavy build). Seat comfort was good for economy. Food and drink standard and service were great. Crew could not have been nicer. SIN-SYD on A380 rear upper deck economy. Seats F G & L row 82 upper deck. Good leg room again. Great service and refreshments again. Lovely crew again. Have flown SIA before and will fly with them again."
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,,,1,no,4,"SQ A380 SIN-SYD biz class. Young slightly disorganised flight crew (seats and entertainment systems we all like and know about) so this is about to very evident cost cutting by SIA as demonstrated by poor meal service offered. Had ordered Sushi via ""Book the Cook"" and as per inflight menu entree was a cold crab salad. 2 cold dishes that took well on 2 hours to get to my table for dinner. Sushi for biz class was rather disappointing but only until this experience was topped by the ""continental breakfast"": 2 slices each of papaya and pomelo accompanied by a small roll/danish pastry with butter and choice of jam tea or coffee - no second offering and plates couldn't be cleared fast enough. Would have thought you already saved enough on that sub-standard Bollinger being served."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew from LAX to Koh Samui via Narita and Singapore. Long flight in economy seating. Paid a little extra ($50/per seat) for leg space worth it for me. The staff on board were exemplary in their treatment of the guests and yes even in the economy seats I felt were treated well by the on board staff. Extremely polite I'm a nervous flyer and they made feel very confident in their abilities. I would definitely recommend this airline to anyone flying to Asia.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,From Adelaide to Singapore and return in A330-300 Singapore to London and return in A380. The A330 was reasonably new on the way up but an older rattler coming back. Also I don't understand when you leave Singapore at midnight why you only have a choice of three main dishes? After a few hours in the Silver Kris lounge all I wanted was a snack such as cheese & biscuits or a sandwich - with a glass of Bollinger to help send me to sleep! It's a less than 7-hour flight with a big tailwind so why over-cater? Both A380 flights were impeccable. Even smarter service going up than coming back. Wonderful to have a lie-flat and a hectare of room to sleep in and a functional wide- choice IFE. In my view Qantas made a big mistake dropping its QF81 service to Singapore in favour of going via Dubai. Hint: You need to think like passengers do not like a Qantas executive's dream.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,3,yes,5,Flew Bali to LHR via Singapore on 4th Oct. Bali to Singapore on 777-200 showing its age very small screen to view films etc but no big deal as flight was just over 2 hours. Ran out of my choice of meal but crew were great. Singapore to LHR on 777-300 ER instead of A380 but managed to get two seats together at the back of the plane. Food quality not great and they again ran out of my meal choice for breakfast. Large seat back screen and plane was fitted with new Krisworld system so plenty of choice of Films TV shows etc. No trolley drinks service after take off just crew with a tray of water juice and beer.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,SFO-INC on a B777-300ER. The legroom was ok nothing exceptional. The cabin and toilets were kept clean throughout the duration of the flight. The krisworld IFE was superb with a wide range of movies music and games. The 2 meals were delicious and probably the best I have tasted in the air. The cabin crew as always were exceptional serving the drinks frequently to keep us well hydrated. Will recommend this airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,1,Arrived from London with my fiance. We bought tickets from their website and purchased preferred seats for an extra hundred dollars only to end up sitting in completely different sections of the plane. Our advance purchase had not been logged into their booking system. Our problem isn't that we couldn't sit next to each other but the way in which we were treated by the Singapore Airlines staff. One particular male check in staff blatantly displayed annoyance at us and showed no signs that he was willing to rectify the issue. We gave in and just decided to sit in whatever was assigned to us and after a promise of a refund for the preferred seating we were dismissively waved off. Started off badly on the ground and continued in the air when we were bypassed during meal service and one rude staff wasn't interested when we questioned her. A senior crew noticed this and was professional in trying to make up for it but by then we were fed up at the inadequacy and total lack of customer service.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,2,no,5,I have been travelling on SIA for last 12 years. I find the standard of service dropping every time I take the airline in the recent past. NZ to Singapore is a long trip. The service was really poor never got what was requested. Food was bad did not even bother to eat my final meal on the return trip to NZ. Some staff rude their standard of service was bias on the type of passenger. July trip was the worst airline experience I have had in my 20 years of airline travel. Very substandard service. In future travelling on SIA is not a status but a necessity.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,3,yes,7,FRA-SIN on A380. The upper deck is a real comfy little cabin as there are only around 15 rows in Economy. This improves the service even more. Food reasonable as always. IFE broke down after 6 hours and couldn't be fixed again bud didn't want to switch my seat. I like the opportunity to charge my mobile at the plane as I use it a lot for listening to music.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,ADL-SIN-DME / LHR-SIN-ADL. Four legs with SQ for this trip to Europe. Seems that catering has improved since my last trip in April. All aircraft (330 777-300 & 380) were comfortable and clean. Ground staff and crew were friendly and IFE was excellent. Still offering the best product for international travel by far.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Travelled on 17th September with my wife and 17 month old London to Singapore. Really great staff looked after our daughter very well indeed. We paid for her own seat which we fitted her car seat into which was ideal. Food was good with a great choice. Really enjoyed flying Singapore and on the A380 was even better than I expected.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,Singapore to Japan on a late night flight 11pm to 9am. I was surprised that the drinks service was reduced to being given a choice of juice water or beer from trays instead of the full drinks cart service. I got what I requested when I asked for it specifically. The menu card provided listed that a selection of snacks are available upon request before breakfast. When I asked what the options were the stewardess gave me a few pieces of tiny biscuits. On the way back the stewardess gave me the option of instant noodles or biscuits. I wonder if these are cost cutting measures. The new advertisements portrayed better service though hence I was disappointed. Air France and KLM offers a much better snack selection of chocolates fruits sandwiches cakes throughout their flight. The choice of entertainment options is great though.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Manchester to Singapore via Munich return. There was good choice of food a nice dinner (with 3 main course choices) and a cooked breakfast as well as another light snack. The cabin crew came around frequently during the flight with orange juice and water. Also snacks and chocolates were available on request from the galley! A good selection of films along with free headphones and a comfort pack of toothpaste toothbrush socks etc. The cabin crew were very welcoming and helpful with assisting passengers with finding seats and locating space for carry on luggage. Previously I have flown a lot with American Airlines and Iberia which do not come anywhere near to Singapore Airlines. I had forgotten that long haul travel in economy class could be so delightful! Singapore Airlines were wonderful.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,SQ12 to Los Angeles Via Tokyo on the Sep 11 and SQ 11 return on 24th Sep. Flight was not entirely full approximately 70%. Had 3 seats to myself which was nice. Seat was comfortable and not as hard as one would imagine. Drinks service begins once we took off and it came back on intervals throughout the duration of the flight time. Food was great and i went for both of the Japanese selection which was awesome. Krisworld was excellent too with lots of entertainment though it should be using touch screen by now. (Those who are transiting to Los Angeles will need to exit the plane transit through security and back in the gate). All these took 10 mins and with lots of help from the Japanese and Singapore crew. Great Airline Great service.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,SQ228 SQ68 SQ365 SQ227. Melbourne to Barcelona return. Excellent experience with Singapore Airlines. The service is excellent. Cant complain even though 23 hours of flying in economy is difficult. The service was outstanding and would not have any doubts recommending to anyone. The staff are excellent and the service is top notch even for economy.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,3,yes,9,Traveled from Singapore to Zurich on A380. The Kirsworld entertainment system is excellent! but not touchscreen and must be operated by a remote which seemed old to me. The food served on board this Singapore Airlines flight sector was great! I was served two meals and both tasted okay  no complains from me. The service standards from the FA is still as good as before! As this was a long haul flight toothbrushes and socks were given out to all the passengers including blankets and pillows. The FA's made lots of trips around serving water and OJ trying not to make the passengers dehydrated because of the flight. The FA's also forced all passengers to shut their window blinds to give passengers more rest as it was in the day. Overall another excellent flight on Singapore Airlines!
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,2,no,5,A380 Singapore to Milan. Sub standard champagne average at best food average wines with food. This was a night flight. Cabin attendant allowed children to enter [from economy] and exit their parents in business class near me and this resulted in a minimum of sleep for me and perhaps others around these parents.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,MEL to SIN SQ228 and SIN to PARIS SQ334 on A380. Excellent attentive service good food and wines and a comfortable flight on a very quiet aircraft. Could not ask for more. The Krisworld IFE has TV series rather than the one episode much appreciated.
,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,My husband and I were very impressed with Singapore Airlines. The cabin crew were polite professional and attentive during the flight. I was impressed with how they kept the bathrooms clean during the flight always with a smile on their faces. The food was very good - we were in economy plus and very impressed with all meals. While the uniforms are beautiful I did wonder how they would perform in any emergency of vacating the plane. We would definitely fly Singapore Airlines again.
,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,"SYD-SIN on A380. SQ lounge in Sydney closed for refurbishment - NZ lounge no substitute. Charming crew (one of the best I had on SQ) very attentive with some great characters- the wide seat (with limited recline) is fine by me but look forward to new seat on 777's. Catering not that great (still quite good) but appears to suffer from ""cost savings""? Nice selections of teas - champagne not worth the name . IFE great selection and good screen size."
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,AMS-SIN. Singapore Airlines is a class act. The flight attendants were terrific the cabin was comfortable and inviting and the food was absolutely delicious. Long-haul flights are just more pleasant on this carrier.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,1,no,4,Flew from SIN to SGN on a 777. The plane was showing its age and the seat was uncomfortable. Had to book last minute at the airport - no Internet option. Very expensive.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,A380 SIN-LHR. Sublime service spacious seating/bedding arrangements. Very good food excellent inflight entertainment. Overall a highly enjoyable and recommended flying experience. Managed to get 6 hrs sleep which was a bonus. Only slight criticism was colour of interior a tad bland.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,JFK-SIN-BKK and SIN-JFK. Seat on A380 is uncomfortable for a long flight. Old style seats on B777-200er are much more comfortable. Foods served on all flights were delicious. FA's were great and served with smiles on all segments of the flight. Upper deck of A380 is much more quieter and easier to sleep on long haul flights. Singapore airlines assigned four FA's on upper deck to serve 88 passengers which is very efficient to get meals served quicker. Frequently providing the drink run. Sandwiches fresh fruits chips mixed fruits and drinks were available at the galley for hungry passengers to snack on at night.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,3,yes,9,CMB-SIN-CGK-SIN-CMB. Outbound flight from Colombo was satisfactory. Crew were friendly and meals were in large quantities. Aircraft was well maintained. SIN-CGK - Crew were in competition with the timing but still met satisfactory standards. Return CGK-SIN flew the 777-300 left Jakarta at 1705 hrs and landed on time. Singapore- Colombo Main course was inedible and dressed with unnecessary oil. Crew were efficient but no smiles. Highly recommend the airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,SYD-SIN and SIN-LHR on A380s travelling as a couple with two children under 2. SQ remains our first choice after yet again making potentially challenging flights more than bearable. Having booked well in advance the airline blocked a window seat at the front of economy (row 31) to give us extra room for our toddler who was too big for the bassinet. Crew were patient and very accommodating providing milk on several occasions and even washing bottles for us. There was never a crossed word from them even when the toddler made one of his regular sprints through the galleys. I requested seafood meals at booking which were excellent. IFE was very good as always. Our double stroller was delivered promptly after landing to the jetway. I am more than happy to pay the extra money to fly SQ.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,,,2,no,5,SIN to Zurich. Return Amsterdam to SIN. As usual when I fly on Singapore Airlines the food service is their strongest suit - excellent except for the wine which is closer to vinegar than alcohol. Seats are alright but not any more comfortable than on other airlines. IFE system awkward to use and earbuds uncomfortable. Their weakest point? Staff Service. Flight attendants polite but extremely robotic and not particularly friendly. They always seem to be reading from a script when talking to passengers. Crew on just about any other airline do a much better job of making customers feel welcome.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,MEL-SIN on SQ 208. I felt A330 seats were more comfortable than the bigger aircraft A380. Food was superb and you will never go wrong with Krisworld - the inflight entertainment. Staff were attentive and there is no doubt that this is one of the top 5 star airlines in the world.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,SIN-SYD. It was a midnight flight staff tried their best to serve all passengers without disturbing their sleep. Staff were friendly and food was served in a prompt manner. Good range of inlight entertainment but it's the seats that allow you to have adequate rest even in economy class. Might not be the cheapest for a 5 star airlines but it's worth every single cent as they ensure that you get to your final destination safely and comfortably.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,My husband and I flew 28th July Tullamarine - Singapore SQ 238. 29th July Singapore - London SQ 318. 27th Aug London - Singapore SQ319 Singapore - Tullamarine SQ217. I have nothing but high praise for staff at all time. Attendants were attentive polite and helpful. Food was fine and plenty of it. We haven't travelled a lot but Singapore Airlines will be my choice of airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,AMS-SIN-CGK. Flight was on time. Arrived at Singapore Changi airport on time nice airport for transit. Aircraft from AMS-SIN was refitted B777-200ER. which is quiet old but clean nice and comfortable (use 3x3x3 configuration). Staff on both flights were attentive they also offered drinks every several times. However the LCD screen for the entertainment is quite old so the resolution of the screen wasn't really clear.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,FRA-JFK-FRA on A380. Outbound good service good food - especially the deserts - and hard working and friendly crew who gave plenty of drinks. Inbound good service again but bad food and ran out of choice. Both flights left bang on time and arrived early inbound even 45 mins earlier. Efficient boarding on big A380 which has fantastic IFE but not more legroom than any other plane or airline. Would have thought SQ give their flagship a more spectacular cabin design but no difference from other planes. All in all good experience for a reasonable price but not on par with e.g. Qatar Airways.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew economy London to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore and back. Full flight on both long haul legs but staff were good - efficient attentive and constantly offering drinks. Queues for toilets were short quality of food good and lots of movies. Found the games not up to scratch and showing their age. Seat and legroom comfortable enough. Definitely the best carrier to the Far East. Stopover in Singapore airport good with lots to do.
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,,,2,no,2,Sydney to Singapore 27th July 2013 SQ232 and returned 13th August 2013 on SQ211. Outbound flight was good on the A380. Attendants robotic but efficient nonetheless even though they took their time responding to request buttons. Seats aren't the worst but not the best. Recline was good seat pitch not so much. I enjoyed the meals on this flight especially the Western steak cooked perfectly. Nothing too troublesome. The return leg however was very disappointing on a tattered B777 aircraft. Seats were extremely uncomfortable with small recline and an industry standard 32 inch seat pitch. Crew were far less attentive than the first leg. It took different crew trying to ask for some basic toiletries or a glass of water. Seat back TV's were tiny and intermittently froze throughout the flights. Overall whilst the first flight was above average the return was far from acceptable.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Took SQ's flight bound for Taipei a few weeks back. Brunch meal was served omelette with baked beans grilled chicken sausage and tomato - tasted decent but having baked beans on a 5-star airline just does not seem to fit the line. Service was great with crew readily available should you have any needs/queries. Flight journey was smooth too. Seats were rather comfortable with head rest. AVOD was up to date with interesting movies and games but the earphone is rather uncomfortable. Probably SQ should invest in noise-cancelling headphones for Y class passengers in futures. SQ is also family-friendly as there is a kids channel in AVOD and activities for kids such as coloring books.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,My wife and I flew 4 long haul flights from Melbourne to Frankfurt in June 2013. As both of us have had knee operations we asked for and they obliged us with adjacent seats so we could stretch our legs into aisles. Seats were comfortable enough for the long haul. Cabin staff were excellent in their duties. Seeing that my wife was using crutches at the time all staff offered assistance to her. This is our first experience with long haul flights and were very impressed without exception. The food was served hot and they catered to everyone's request. Drinks were served on a regular basis. I would recommend this airline to an one wishing to fly long haul. Inflight entertainment appeared to be up to date and there was a good choice of recent films to watch. Will certainly fly with them again without hesitation.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,July 20th SIN-SFO via ICN. Return August 2 SFO-SIN via ICN. SA has always been rated very high for service but I think they are starting to cut corners. Their equipment still looks great seats are comfortable and inflight entertainment is great but the service is really slipping. I rang the call button 3 times during one flight as I desperately needed a soda but nobody ever came. The meals have definitely been shrinking in size and the kids meals are becoming more unusual. A kids meal should almost be generic like pizza or spaghetti but you rarely see those offered.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flying the SQ flagship A380 on the Frankfurt - NY route is a total joy. This is truly a premium airline with a top notch product and service. Although there is more competition these days in the premium airline category SQ truly brings back the romance of flying. Their superb service and product makes the premium price totally worth it. Of course now as I enter the US I have to prepare myself for flying the American carriers. They have a thing or two to learn about from SQ.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,SQ uses the refurbished 777-200ERs on the Singapore - Amsterdam route. Although this is the new business class seat the cabin is not quite the same as the new 777-300ER planes that have the same product. The main difference is in the IFE system. Masked as a new system it actually seems to be the old system built into the new seat. Thus the selection of movies and quality of display is lacking. For the rest it's up to the impeccable SQ standard. Unbelievable service terrific food and a great bed.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,2,no,4,SUB-SIN with SIA in Economy Class. Flight was delayed by one hour due to late arrival from SIN. Once on board the crew distributed hot towels but not all passenger got it. Food was edible and the entertainment system worked well. The in-flight service was not so good some FA were just friendly whereas the others were not. A steward even raised his voice while asking my little boy to switch off his IPAD around 40 minutes before our arrival at the Changi Airport. All in all for the price I paid it was not what I expected from a 5 star airline.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Airbus A380 from LAX to Singapore with a stop at Tokyo-Narita. Excellent cockpit crew and cabin staff. Very attentive to the needs of the passengers. Ground staff at LAX and at Changi were very helpful courteous and friendly. Once the plane reaches cruising altitude it is practically quiet. We will always fly on SIA whenever our schedules allow. We go to Asia every 2 to 3 years and SIA is our first choice!
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew MEL-SIN-IST business class. Really enjoyed the new MEL lounge which has a nice modern feel. The first leg was on the 777-300 with the regional business seat which was comfortable. The crew on this leg however were very robotic and just went through the motions. SIN-IST was on the refitted 777-200ER and the service and food was amazing. The crew could not do enough for us and insisted on making our beds. We used booked the cook on this leg and the food was of a very high quality. The seat on the refitted 777 have a few extra storage areas compared those seats on the A380 which I like. I do find the food in the Singapore lounge to be rather uninspiring considering Singapore itself is such a food orientated city. We will fly with SQ again.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,New York to Singapore Via Frankfurt SQ25 August 1 A380. Airplane interior is showing its age. Inflight entertainment has a lot of movies and music to choose from and food in Economy Class is delicious. Snack between meals is good with sandwiches chips and fruits. Singapore to Bangkok SQ972 on August 3 was a Boeing 777-200. The seats in Economy Class are getting old. Singapore Airlines should fly the new Economy Seats to Bangkok or fly the Airbus 330-300. Overall the food and Entertainment in Economy Class is excellent.
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew A380 Suites on SIN-HKG-SIN over the national day holidays. Excellent crew; very accommodating and attentive to needs. In-flight entertainment was giving me issues on the leg home but was promptly resolved after I brought it to the crew's attention. Great seat width and food was good despite not having booked the cook in advance. Otherwise a great flight but avoid the 4th rows where possible as it is near the pantry so it tends to be noisy.
,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,SYD-SIN-BKK-SIN-SYD on a combination of A380 / A330 / 777-200 (2class)/ 777-300ER. Was very happy with every aspect of every flight (except the 1.5hr delay on the last leg). The seats were comfortable on each flight and the catering was superb. I suggest you 'book the cook' and select your exact meal before flying as it was very good. IFE was great on all flights as was the service standards.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,,,2,no,3,Sydney to Singapore last month on 12th and returned 4th August. Inflight experience was alright and staff were generally good some not so much. Food was shoddy on both flights and ended up leaving most of it. Entertainment choices are probably the best out there but the operating system is old and deteriorating. Both flights were on time. Overall it was pretty ordinary and probably better off flying cheaper and spending more in Singapore.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,SQ478 to Johannesburg on 18 June 2013 and returned on SQ479 (departing Johannesburg 20 June). Flight scheduled to leave Singapore around 1am and due to some aircraft problems after boarding we had to return to the terminal and wait for a new aircraft. Flight resumed close to 7am. SIA arranged for refreshments immediately as well as pillows and blankets for our wait at the new boarding gate. My biggest compliment is the crew. The same crew served us on the flight back.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,2,yes,7,Rome to Singapore and back is serviced by old 777-200 with old seats and the seats do not recline completely. I have friends that are flying Qatar to Singapore because of better aircraft's. I fly business class to Singapore every 6 months and I am seriously thinking of changing airlines or fly to Singapore via London to fly the A380. Returned Singapore to Rome on SQ366 Aug 4.
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Travelled for the first time with Singapore to New Zealand a very long trip. The cabin staff were excellent friendly helpful always ready to have a laugh. The food by and large was fine especially for Economy and the choice of Inflight entertainment was very good. The crew made what could have been a grisly experience into an enjoyable one. Seats were fairly cramped in economy.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,SIN-HND-SIN. Both flights outbound and inbound were great cabin and toilets were clean crew members were friendly and in-flight entertainment system was awesome. Will definitely fly Singapore Airlines again good job and keep up the good work Singapore Airlines!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Used SQ for our trip to Vietnam. Lived up to their reputation on all 4 flights. A380 on the 2 longer sectors which was a comfortable journey and found seats and legroom both ok. Older B777/200 on shorter flights which are showing some age but are very well maintained. Food was plentiful and actually quite nice for airline food. Plenty to drink and regular drink runs carried out. IFE had plenty of variety to keep us amused. Crew members polite and friendly. A little more expensive than some other carriers but well worth it for the little extra we paid. Overall would recommend and will always be our first option providing price is reasonable.
,,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,2,no,1,Business Class Sydney - Singapore - Delhi / Mumbai - Singapore - Brisbane. Sydney to Singapore was the only leg which had the newer style business class seats (which are good) although in seat power was not working for the entire duration of the flight. Each of the other legs were on dated planes with the older style business seats (not so great). Of particular concern was the Singapore - Brisbane flight where the seat and its surrounds were visibly dirty. My biggest gripe was the Mumbai - Singapore night time flight. Upon boarding the crew handed out menus and asked if I wanted to be disturbed to eat dinner - which I did after the atrocious Mumbai lounge experience (standing room only). Sure enough I fall asleep and wake up when tables are being set for dinner - I request my meal only to be told that they hadn't heated anything for me so I would just have to wait until after they had served everyone else. No offer of a drink or anything from the crew. Being a late night flight the idea of starting dinner 45 minutes after everyone else was not good. I ended up having to ask the crew to give me a bread roll and that the only food I got! Will never fly again.
,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,"We flew on 4 long-haul legs in June and July business class. Service was friendly and efficient throughout. The meals were well-considered: light dishes were available for every meal plenty to eat and drink. The seats however were not to our satisfaction. There's heaps of room but the back of the seat is straight and the headrest pushes your head forward. The recline angle is small and the adjustable footrest is useless. There is a footstool but I am 173cm tall (5' 8"") and it was too far away for me to use comfortably. So I spent much of the time trying to find a comfortable sitting position. The seat converts to a flat bed and in this position it is fine for sleeping. SIA uses other airlines' lounges in many airports. I hope they don't use United again because their lounge in Melbourne hasn't been updated since discos were fashionable. (SIA's lounge in MEL was being renovated)."
,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,5,LHR-SIN and return on A380. Flight from LHR was on time and all expected services on board. Economy seat in the main cabin on this leg of the flight was reasonable but a little cramped when compared to other airlines. Meal and beverage service was ok but ran out of choice for meal. Entertainment service was excellent. On the return leg with seat in upper deck felt slightly less cramped but seats not the most comfortable for long haul flight. Meal and beverage service was good. Entertainment system was ok programming constantly jerked and froze but was viewable. The disappointment with the flights was the baggage allowance which was small at 20kg when compared with other airlines which offer 32kg.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Recent return Perth - Singapore - (Munich) - Manchester economy. All flights on time exit seats on all flights good food and drinks as required. Excellent / helpful staff. What more could you really ask good old fashioned economy long may it continue. The 777's are showing age somewhat.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Third time I have flown Singapore Airlines from Heathrow Intl to Changi Intl. My overall experience with them has always been satisfactory or above however there are a few issues. The appearance of the cabin is exceptional. Pleasant settings with artwork and during the festive season decorations above windows. I find the seats to be quite comfortable and have plenty of leg space in front of me. Staff are happy to help and are very pleasant. Now the negatives: I find compared with Qantas the in flight entertainment system to be limited. Generally there isn't a great deal of movies to choose from and the TV series they offer are rarely complete series only offering a few episodes. The food isn't that great if you're not a fan of eastern cuisine just wish they would offer a western option every now and then. Overall I would say its a close call between Qantas and SQ for economy and would say Qantas has the edge.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,3,"LHR-SIN. I couldn't book the open-jaw route I wanted on SQ's awful website so booked it as a codeshare with Virgin Atlantic which made online check-in impossible - VS site said the operating airline was someone else and SQ said the booking had been made through a different airline. I phoned VS and they were worse than useless SQ at least sympathised and the gent I spoke to said he would send a message to LHR requesting the seat I was hoping for. I was one of the last to check-in and indeed a window on the left had been saved for me so kudos for that. Boarding was OK although the cabin crew in my area didn't speak much English which complicated some pax requests for reseating. First meal service was OK lots of movies but not many good ones seat comfortable and managed some sleep. One reason I booked SQ was to enjoy an Asian style breakfast so you can imagine my frustration that despite distributing a lavish eight page printed menu to economy passengers which included three breakfast options (including a tasty-sounding pork and noodles exactly what I'd had in mind) they were only able to offer ""chicken sausage with frittata"" which was as disgusting as it sounds. Arrived on time and customs and baggage claim was pretty quick. Beyond being deposited at the destination safely and on time SQ fell short of expectations. Will not go out of my way to fly them again."
,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,no,3,SQ232 30 JUNE SYD - SINGAPORE SQ366 1ST JULY SINGAPORE - ROME. Economy was ordinary on my flight Sydney to Rome. Sound quality from the headphones awful seat recline was terrible and the flight attendants gave dagger looks if you wanted a drink throughout the flight if it wasn't during meal service.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Perth-Singapore-Perth in economy on refitted regional 777-200. Aircraft interior in excellent condition. Legroom was quite acceptable for what is only a 5+ hour flight. Flights in each direction were a breakfast time departure and we found the food to be very good with both the Western and Asian selections filling and tasty. Flights pretty much ran to time on departure and both arrived early. The onboard service was excellent on both flights with genuine smiles and attention. Just like the SQ of old. Happy to fly with them again.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,SQ25 from JFK to FRA on July 11 - A380 upper deck economy superb 2-4-2 vs 3-4-3 on main deck window seat - plenty of storage legroom fine (and I'm over 6ft) service very attentive and great menu selection for food/drinks. Nice and quiet for sleeping upstairs too. Hadn't flown SQ in 7yrs nothing different. Same solid airline that understands what good service is and how to deliver it. Surprised to read negative reviews about how they've dropped no evidence on that night.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,BCN to SIN (SQ 377) and SIN to BNE (SQ 235) on the B777-300ER and A330-300 respectively. Both flights were consistent in terms of food quality seat comfort and service. All of which were exceptional especially when compared to other leading airlines. The IFE was also commendable - updated with the latest movies and very user friendly.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,MEL-SIN return. Usually travel Business Class but tried Economy on this short trip. Overall impression was pretty good. Both flights were almost full but the crews were friendly and helpful and food service was quite slow but quality of the food was reasonable. Had a strange experience with the inflight entertainment system on both flights an English Language film suddenly lapsed into a version dubbed into some oriental language. Eventually reset by repeated switches out of the video system. Selection of films etc was OK but not comparable to Emirates product. One criticism is that the IFE was switched off 40 minutes before landing on the Singapore leg (A380). On the return trip it was switched off 20 minutes before landing. Seems ungenerous and not my experience on other airlines. A FA on the Melbourne flight also asked me to remove my noise-cancelling headphones for landing - also a new experience! Online check-in was difficult because of website problems but managed it in the end and subsequent check-in at Melbourne was very quick. Unable to check-in online for return trip due to more website problems but the standard check-in system at Changi was just excellent. Better than some Business Class check-in processes in fact.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,BCN to SIN (SQ 377) on 14 July 2013. Flight was excellent from the food to the IFE to the flight attendants. The FA's were always on-hand for any requests and were super friendly (hard to find in many airlines theses days).
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,FRA to JFK and back. I am a frequent traveller and have been on more than 25 airlines so far. But Singapore airlines always exceeds my expectations! They serve food in economy that could easily be served in business classes of other carriers. The entertainment system is just great and the legroom is good. The great attitude of the friendly crews gives you the feeling that you are welcome onboard and that it is a pleasure for them to make you feel comfortable. This was my second time on Singapore Airlines and definitely not the last one!
,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,FRA-SIN and SIN-MEL in first. Excellent crews on both legs. Catering good the food seems always to be better out of Changi than out of Frankfurt in my opinion. Always a pleasure to fly SQ. Keep up the good work.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,LHR-SIN SIN-MEL. Great service from start to finish. The crew on the first leg were the most friendly and cheerful I've had on a flight even on a full flight and through very uncomfortable turbulence. The seats were good a little painful after 13 hours but the leg room (which is usually a major discomfort for me) was good for economy. Food was good not great but better than most. As with all airlines they need to make money but at least with Singapore Airlines you feel like a human being rather than cattle. Plus Changi airport is excellent which makes SA even more of a no brainier decision.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,SQ 407/408 DEL-SIN-DEL on B700. On time push back both flights early arrival in both destinations. Seat was better than most Economy products however the entertainment was lagging behind peers (esp Emirates). Meals were adequate on both legs. All in all no complaints: a quality product.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,Travelled JUN-JUL MAN-MUC-SIN-BNE return in Y. All flights on time or early Seating reservations honoured AVOD fully operational on all sectors albeit the systems more responsive on the A333 than the 77W. Seats are perfectly fine for Y. Food was plentiful and tasty as were the drinks in both alcoholic and non alcoholic varieties. All crews pleasant and addressed us by name and baggage showed up. There were only two issues meal choices ran out on MUC-SIN and suitable alternative wasn't offered. Secondly had we been advised you were not allowed off the plane on the SIN-MUC-MAN leg in MUC we would have travelled via LHR turned a 12 hour leg into a 15 hour ordeal. In summary I would highly recommend but check the transit stops.
,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,AKL-SIN 777 200 plane was old but seats were comfortable. The service was average food was terrible choices poor. The entertainment system was old screen scratched and selection average. I have flown a lot on SQ over the years but recently tried EK who are far superior. SQ have lost their edge their product is old. I would choose EK or NZ if I had a choice in future.
,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,DEL-SIN-MNL-SIN-DEL. Flights from Delhi on the retrofitted 777-300s and to Manila on the new A333s. Check in was a breeze at each airport. Boarding was in row sequence starting from the back of the plane and very orderly. Was on window seats all through out and happy to be able to select seats at the time of booking. Night flight from DEL- SIN was a red eye meals served not too quickly after take off. Service excellent and warm on all legs. Crew could not do enough and responded promptly to anything requested. White wine in economy class is stellar. Food was fine and could be better. I had selected vegetarian oriental meals which were light and flavourful. One of the Asian veg meals I had weren't as good. Seats have a generous width and seat pitch. Seats seemed even better on the A330 since they are the newer economy class seat leg rests are a huge welcome to tired feet. AVOD was great on the A330s but not as much on the 777-300s. The announcements from the cockpit were well timed and regular keeping us informed of all delays and weather conditions. Top notch and will recommend.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LHR-SIN on 777 excellent service as usual good choice of entertainment and food was very good and despite the slight delay in boarding we were still able to leave on time and reached SIN an hour early. Return leg was on an A380 and was excellent once again. Crew was friendly and helpful and will continue to use SIA on my yearly trips to Singapore.
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,ICN-SIN SIN-TPE. It was a superb journey with SQ. Excellent inflight entertainment authentic service by SQ staffs and well-decorated cabin. I can say it was the one of my top 3 flights I have enjoyed so far. Highly recommended!
,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,SFO-ICN (refuelling stop) - SIN-DEL route. The service was excellent. The air hostesses always had a smile on their faces and were very patient and kind. The inflight entertainment was very good too. There was a large selection of movies TV shows and music to watch and listen to. The food was so-so. I did like the deserts but I didn't particularly enjoy the dinner. Our plane was a Boeing 777-300ER from SFO-SIN. It was very clean and the seats and everything were comfortable. Our plane from SIN-DEL was a Boeing 777-200ER an older plane but still the cabin was clean and tidy. Overall a great experience and one I would definitely recommend again.
